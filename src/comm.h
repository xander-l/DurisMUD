  ** is done before Exceptional.
  **
  ** Note that depending on the value returned by the callbacks,
  ** the corresponding IOStruct may or may not be removed from
  ** list of callbacks.  If removal occurs, io_*fds will be updated
  ** accordingly.
  **
  ** Function returns 0 if all callbacks called return 0 or 1, and
  ** returns -1 if any 1 of callbacks return -1.  Note that
  ** all callbacks are processed (even if some encounters error),

  **
  ** If a callback returns 0 or -1, the corresponding file descriptor
  ** will be closed automatically, and the space for that particular

  ** error occurs.  They should not be examined if this function
