  void justice_guard_remove(P_char);
     Given an NPC, this does the reverse of justice_register_guard().
     First checks to see if this mob was ever "registered", and if so,
     de-registers it.  Most often would be used in extract_char(), but
     also may be used in other circumstances where this guard is
     unable to come to the "call of duty" (ie: gets charmed).  Note
     that it is safe to call this function on a non-justice mob.

  void justice_action_invader(P_char);
     Given any char, ch, it determines if ch is an "invader" to the
     hometown (if any) they are in.  If so, and if they aren't already
     being dealt with, it deals with them.  Invaders are treated
     simply.  Hunt, and kill.

   of assumptions:
     1) no more then 16 hometowns will ever exist
     2) a player cannot be WANTED, _and_ KNOWN, etc.  Basically, you
        have only one designation for any town

   How does it work?  Well, given the flags below for wanted, known,
   etc, a play can only have 1 of 4 states in a given town.  Those 4
   states can be put into a mere 2 bits.  The first hometown goes into
   the first 2 bits.. the second hometown into the 2nd two, and so on.
