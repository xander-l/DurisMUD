/* keepers for publi interface:

  void justice_register_guard(P_char);
     Given a NPC, ch, decides if ch is "qualified" to be a justice
     guard, and registers it if so.  NOTE: Put all qualifications in
     this function, and NOT in db.c or elsewhere.  This gives a
     CENTRAL location for changing qualifications, instead of having
     shit spread all over gods creation. (one exception being that
     db.c might only call this function for mobs that load in
     hometowns)

  void justice_guard_remove(P_char);
     Given an NPC, this does the reverse of justice_register_guard().
     First checks to see if this mob was ever "registered", and if so,
     de-registers it.  Most often would be used in extract_char(), but
     also may be used in other circumstances where this guard is
     unable to come to the "call of duty" (ie: gets charmed).  Note
     that it is safe to call this function on a non-justice mob.

  void justice_hunt_cancel(P_char);
     Given an NPC, first determines if this mob is a justice
     registered mob.  If so, and if this guard is currently "on duty
     dealing with something", it stops the mob from being marked as
     "in use", so that it can be re-used for other justice functions.
     Note that this function should be called by
     justice_guard_remove() in order to keep counts straight...

  void justice_victim_remove(P_char);
     Given any char, ch, it finds any justice guards that might be
     "dealing" with them, and calls justice_hunt_cancel() for those
     guards.  This will most often be called when justice is "done"
     with a character (usually by death).

  void justice_action_invader(P_char);
     Given any char, ch, it determines if ch is an "invader" to the
     hometown (if any) they are in.  If so, and if they aren't already
     being dealt with, it deals with them.  Invaders are treated
     simply.  Hunt, and kill.

     1) no more then 16 hometowns will ever exist
     2) a player cannot be WANTED, _and_ KNOWN, etc.  Basically, you
        have only one designation for any town

   How does it work?  Well, given the flags below for wanted, known,
   etc, a play can only have 1 of 4 states in a given town.  Those 4
   states can be put into a mere 2 bits.  The first hometown goes into
   the first 2 bits.. the second hometown into the 2nd two, and so on.
