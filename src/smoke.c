/* NOTE:  I fully expect this will just be appended to the bottom of magic.c, as the header stuff is outright
 *        murder.  However, it would be nice to keep them separate from the standard spells even in the magic.c
 *        file.  It's just cleaner that way.  Herb spells are designed to be augmentive only, not that they
 *        cannot have deletorious affects on the user.  They should also kind of imitate the effects of real
 *        world herbs/drugs more than magical potion effects like fireshield.  Also, I consider each herb
 *        spell to be a strain of genetics (which is why secondary and tertiary effects are less, hybrids
 *        don't get all of their parents' genes).  So, once the basics are covered there should be no need
 *        to keep adding herb spells.  3 slots on an herb with 5 current herb spells gives a shit load of
 *        combinations of affects for area designers.  Currently, the herb spells cover augmented senses
 *        (herb_ocularius), offensive augmentation (herb_blue_haze), augmented healing (herb_medicus),
 *        mental augmentation (herb_black_kush), and defensive augmentation (herb_gootwiet).
