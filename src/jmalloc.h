/*
** note this package is not 100% compatible with all malloc packages
**
** differences:
**
** after a Free() the memory freed will be garbled before Free() returns
** (ie. Free() garbles the memory you pass to it)
**
** the MallocSize() call is not a standard malloc-package call. using it
** will force dependance upon this paticular package
**
** free(NULL) will be allowed, and will do nothing (besides waste CPU time)
**
** note:
**
** it may run with another malloc package (as long as the other malloc package
** can handle non-contiguous memory blocks)
