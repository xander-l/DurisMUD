This is a help file for coders.  It's designed to help you learn how to
  add stuff to the mud without breaking anything.  Please note that a
  good rule to follow is that nothing is up to date, but is can be a good
  starting place.

Howto Add a Spell:
  First, add the SPELL_<SPELLNAME> <number> to the list in spells.h (search for LAST_SPELL).
    <number> should be 1 greater than the last spell listed.
    Increment LAST_SPELL to be the same as SPELL_<SPELLNAME>
  Second, write the spell stub definition in the appropriate file (smagic for shaman, blispells for blighter, etc).
    Write the spell stub in the appropriate .h file (blispells.h or prototypes.h etc.)
  Third, write a link in skills.c: CREATE_SPELL( .. ) or CREATE_SPELL_MSG( .. ).
    Just copy/double paste a similar spell and make proper changes to the second paste.
  Fourth, add the spell to the proper classes/specs via SPELL_ADD( .. ) or SPEC_SPELL_ADD( .. ).
    Note: the second number is the circle for the spell (ie. 2 => They get it at 6th level in 2nd circle).
  Fourth, write the spell definition after verifying that everything compiles right.
  Fifth, test the spell!
  Sixth, commit/push your new spell.
