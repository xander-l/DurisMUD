 *  -modifier is set to define HOLD_NORMAL or HOLD_IMPROVED.
 * TAG_HEADLOCK- Applied to person who is knocked out from improved headlock.
 * SKILL_ARMLOCK- Applied to person who is being held in armlock.
 *  -modifier is set to define ARMREFLEX_HOLD or ARMREFLEX_OFFBALANCE
 *  -attacks are reduced by half per fight.c

 *  -movement cost is increased by 15.
 * SKILL_GROUNDSLAM- Applied to victim who's been groundslammed.
 *  -Purpose of applying this is to allow for combination into an
 *   improved leglock.
 *
 * Define Definitions:
 * IS_GRAPPLED()- checks if the ch is affected with ANY hold.
 * HOLD_CANT_ATTACK()- Checks if the character is affected with
 *  a hold they can't attack with.
 * IS_*()- Checks if the ch is affected with TAG_* or SKILL_*.
 * IS_S*()- Checks if the ch is affected with SKILL_*.
 * IS_T*()- Checks if the ch is affected with TAG_*.
 *
 * Hold definitions:
 * Bearhug- Hugs the victim, chance to prevent victim from attacking
 *  -main combination opener.
 * Headlock- Grabs the victims head, prevents and stops casting.
 *  -combination into allows chance to knock victim out form lack of air.
 * Armlock- A reflexive skill allowing ch to grab vict's arm.  The proc
 *   reduces attacks by half for the duration.  You can either get your 
 *   arm locked, broken, or you will be thrown off balance instead.
 *  -combination into allows chance to break the arm reducing attacks by
 *   half untill he receives a heal type spell.
 * Leglock- ch and victim need to be !POS_STANDING.  This is a hold type
 *   affect that can lag the ch and victim.
 *  -combination into allows chance to break the leg increasing
 *   movement cost by 15.
 * Groundslam- Usable only as combination into from Bearhug or
 *   Armlock (ARMREFLEX_OFFBALANCE).  Places the ch and victim in
 *   POS_PRONE and CharWait's for a duration, opens up combination
 *   into leglock.
 * 
 * Current combinations:
 * Bearhug -> Headlock
 * Bearhug -> Groundslam -> Leglock
 * Armlock (ARMREFLEX_OFFBALANCE) -> Groundslam -> Leglock
