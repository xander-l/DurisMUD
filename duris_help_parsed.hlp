Celestia
Celestia - Last Edited: 2008-04-11 14:09:16 by Blaize
=====================================================
Celestia, or the Celestial Plane is a great expanse of
the heavens reachable only through portals in the
Ethereal or Astral Planes. Celestia is a war ground
between the forces of good and evil as heavenly and
demonic creatures vying for control of the area for
eons. Angels, Titans, Dragons, and Demons are in a
constant state of battle throughout the majority of
the plane.
Notably, the great Titan Palace, and Lord of all Titankin
Cronus can be found here, as well as the gates of Hell
themselves, protected by the three-headed hellhound,
Cerberus. Though much evil and devastation is abound in
Celestia, the being called Malevolence is a force of
such power and anarchy his plan to destroy the Lifestream
threatens the balance of all, heavenly and mortal alike.

Tharnadia
Tharnadia - Last Edited: 2008-04-11 14:13:25 by Blaize
======================================================
-In memory of Old Tharnadia
It once was...
The sprawling metropolis of Tharnadia is the most active city in all of
Duris. It is the cornerstone of the human economy and the jewel of their
empire. Tharnadia can be found in the southwest corner of the continent,
nestled against its broad and busy port.
Perhaps the most popular place to congregate in Tharnadia is the Ogre"s
Foot Inn. The inn is located roughly in the center of the city, directly in
front of the city"s constantly-bubbling fountain. To the west of the Inn
you will find the city"s resident cleric-physician, who will tend to your
wounds for a small fee. Further west are the stairs to the Shr'nn Mesa,
which leads to the city"s prison -Caer Tannad. Upon further exploration
you"ll be happy to find many guild towers complete with shops and teachers,
and also the main cargo port for Tharnadia lies here, where the WaveDancer,
one of the ferrys, departs to carry passengers around the bay for a nominal
fee. The northernmost part of the city opens up to Tharnadia's port beaches,
where one can take a casual stroll to take in the salty ocean air. Be careful
there, though, the beach can be dangerous to those caught unaware. On the beach
itself lies Bradistock Manor, famous for the haunting tales that keep many
Tharnadian children awake at night. The southern part of the city is renowned
for its seedy back-alleys, thugs and criminals. Far enough south, however, and
the beach can once again be found leading to the lighthouse and Tranquility
island. Leaving the Inn to the east going towards the gates of the city,
you can"t help but notice the sites and smells of the local Bazaar.
Travelers from all around stop to sample the wares sold here. North of the
Bazaar is a Bank and the magnificent Temple of the Paladins, where all are
welcome to stop and rest up awhile. Before leaving the city make sure to
stop and rent a mount for the journey for a trip across Goodie Continent
can be a tiring one!
Traveling out of the city on the Grand Tharnadia Way you will pass through
it"s beautiful forest filled with a variety of animal life, ponds and
walking trails.

Karma
Karma - Last Edited: 2008-03-25 20:06:41 by Blaize
==================================================
Karma is a mystical sum of the actions of a living soul.  It is believed that
through actions deemed as morally positive, one will be met by similarly
positive actions.  The opposite of course being that if one is morally negative
that only negative actions will that soul meet.  Karma is not the same as fate,
as all who live make decisions that affect themselves.  Karma is merely a way
of expressing the whole of one's actions throughout a lifetime.  Karma has an
indirect effect upon a soul that is guided by that soul's decisions; for better
or for worse.

==================================================
* Area of effect: <self>
* Aggressive:     No
* Cumulative:     No
* Duration:       Dependent on devotion proficiency
* Type of spell:  Protection
Paladins were granted an unusual holy spell to combat certain
opponents. Dharma scatters the paladin's soul into limbo so it may
brush up against the positive plane of existence. The paladin's soul
requires protection otherwise dharma will falter and fade.
When the paladin is in a melee and their opponent has somehow surpassed
their regular lifeforce, the energies of the positive plane will transfer
some of lifeforce to the paladin, which causes the paladin to experience
exuberant righteousness.
Devotion is a vital aspect as it increases dharma's duration and
effectiveness. Dharma provides some protection and healing abilities
only if the paladin is receiving a transfer of lifeforce and their
devotion exceeds certain thresholds.
This spell will only show on score if those affected have detect magic up.

Agility - Last Edited: 2008-03-25 20:02:51 by Blaize
====================================================
Agility is a measure of how coordinated you are overall; how well you
handle movements of your whole body. It is the primary attribute of Rogue
and Fighter type classes. For Thieves, it will enable them to have better
chances with skills such as "Trip". For Fighters and Rogues, it will
increase the rate at which they "Dodge" and "Parry" attacks.

Alignment
Alignment - Last Edited: 2007-04-19 19:17:09 by Unknown
=======================================================
Your character's alignment (GOOD, NEUTRAL, or EVIL) will govern how he or
she reacts to other players and/or monsters. The following is an outline of
the alignment system:
GOOD (350 to 1000) is the most prone to change (i.e., the hardest to
maintain). Killing other good-aligned players and monsters will harm it the
most, but killing neutrals can shift it towards evil as well.
NEUTRAL (-349 to 349) is affected most by killing non-extreme
alignments (i.e., other neutrals). Killing extremes such as 1000 and -1000
is just maintaining the balance, and will have no effect on your alignment.
EVIL (-350 to -1000) is the most difficult to change. Almost anything
an evil person kills can be considered (at best) a neutral act, but it is
most likely the kill will just serve to make the person more evil. Only by
killing things more evil than oneself can one creep up out of the pit.
Alignment ranges from -1000 to 1000. Due to the way alignment works, before
long your alignment will actually reflect your playing style, and will not
fluctuate much unless you change your playing style drastically.

Ansi
Ansi - Last Edited: 2018-11-08 01:58:29 by lohrr
================================================
Duris is a world of color and in order to better understand how to add
color to certain things (such as guild titles) you need to know the ANSI
codes for it.
There are 5 basic types of ANSI color control sequences:
1)  &<n|N>       - Sets the background and foreground colors back to default.
2)  &+<color>    - Sets the foreground color. If the letter is uppercase, the color is bold.
3)  &-<color>    - Sets the background color. If the letter is uppercase, the text will blink.
4)  &=<bg><fg>   - Sets both background <bg> and foreground <fg> color, exactly the same
                     as setting the background and foreground separately.
5)  &&           - use an actual ampersand (not an ansi color).
Each color is specified using a letter. Black is L, red is R, cyan is C,
blue is B, white is W, green is G, yellow is Y, and magenta is M. To
specify the bright version of the color use the uppercase letter; for the
dark color, use the lowercase letter.
The actual colors themselves are as follows:
        Bright    Dark          Bright    Dark
        --------------------------------------
        Black     Black         White     White
        Red       Red           Green     Green
        Cyan      Cyan          Yellow    Yellow
        Blue      Blue          Magenta   Magenta

Anti-Paladin
Anti-Paladin - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:03:20 by ashyel
=========================================================
Anti-Paladins are knights that follow the dark powers of the world. Anti-Paladins like their good-aligned analogs the Paladins, are hearty warriors that possess limited spell-like powers, enhanced by excellent wisdom. These powers are granted to them by their evil deities and are used to further advance their vile causes. Anti-paladins are excellent tanks and horsemen.
When starting an Anti-Paladin relies heavily on his natural attributes.  High Agility and Constitution will improve his tanking abilities, while high Dexterity and Strength will improve  damage output. Anti-Paladins also benefit from heightened wisdom which will decrease the time it takes to pray for spells.
With their Paladin auras, they are able to bestow effects on all the members of their group, leading to an increase in the effectiveness of the entire group.
Note: Anti-Paladins take reduced heal amounts from Clerics.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   anatomy, advanced meditation, devotion, expert riposte, shield combat, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control.
==Equipment Usage==
Like all classes on Duris, Anti-Paladins have their own set of equipment they can use. Anti-Paladins can use most weapons and armor, but are rather limited in their use of magic items.

Armor Class - Last Edited: 2007-04-20 14:02:09 by Unknown
=========================================================
Armor Class - AC
Armor Class is a rating of how tough you are against physical attacks. The more armor you wear, the better protected you are. Typically, the heavier the armor, the better the protection. However, enchanted armor can provide you with more protection as well as have less of an encumbrance.
Base AC is around 0 and granting 0% damage reduction, if you are naked, and have normal agility. Equipment that affects your AC by -values will reduce the damage you take in melee combat (i.e. a robe that grants -10 AC will reduce the damage you receive by 1%). -1000 AC would result in 100% melee damage reduction if such a feat were possible, but is not.
AC property on items is physical protection granted by them and is strictly related to the material item is made of. As you may expect materials like cloth, feathers, bark grant very little or next to none physical protection while rare metals like mithril or adamantium make extremely durable armors. The total bonus granted by the item also depends on the location it is designed for. Body armors are more important than masks or bracelets. Also full body armors are considerably more effective than set of separate chestplate, sleeves and leggings of the same material.
Armor, spiritarmor|Spirit Armor, phantomarmor|Phantom Armor, vaporarmor|Vapor Armor, enhancearmor|Enhance Armor, Barkskin, Baladorsprotection|Baladors Protection, and songofprotection|Song of Protection grant bonuses to armor class; whereas, coldsnap|Cold Snap, Blindness, faeriefire|Faerie Fire, and Wither will weaken armor class.

Armorclass - Last Edited: 2008-03-21 15:43:57 by Blaize
=======================================================
The lower your character"s AC (acronym for "Armor Class"), the less chance
he or she will have of getting injured by physical attacks. Armor class
numbers run into the negatives (good!).
Examples:
     0          full melee damage
  -100          -10% melee damage
  -200          -20% melee damage

Army of Armageddon
Army of Armageddon - Last Edited: 2007-04-20 14:02:09 by Unknown
================================================================
The Army of Armageddon is a dark force bent on plunging the world into chaos. Though it is well
known that the bulk of their forces have been gathering in caverns deep below a forest hidden off
in the northlands, they have also been seen scattered about many different locations around
the world, preparing for a larger invasion. The dark army is purely chaotic, aligning itself
with neither side of the racewar, and everyone should beware if traces of the Army of Armageddon
are seen.

Artifact
Artifact - Last Edited: 2017-09-19 00:43:26 by lohrr
====================================================
Artifacts are the premier weapons, armor, and items in the game.  Each
artifact or arti, has its own special characteristics, which make each
one, one of a kind. One could consider obtaining and owning an artifact a
great accomplishment. Though watch your back, other players desire them
as much if not more than you do...
Players are expected to hold artis they obtain. However, they do not need
to drag the artifact around on characters that cannot wield/use them.
As an example, you sorcerer can be using the staff of blue flames and
your paladin can be running around with avernus.
The best way to avoid problems is to not be greedy.  Artifacts are not meant to be
hoarded -- if your primary character doesn't need the artifact, you probably
should give it to someone else.
For a list of artifacts that players own, type artifacts. To review the unique
artifacts, type artifact unique.

Krindor's Incredible Device - special affect for Monks, Illusionists, Psionicists, Bards, and Rogues

Ascend - Last Edited: 2016-01-18 06:30:45 by lohrr
==================================================
The 'ascend' command is used by certain classes to ascend to a higher power form of life.
This command can only be used at an appropriate location(an altar for Paladins, a teacher
for Theurgists).
In the case of the Paladin, it will be as an Agathinon Avenger.
In the case of the Theurgist, it will become an Eladrin.
The cost of ascension is currently 250 epic points.

* say <text>

* ask <character> <text>
* project <text>
In order to communicate with other players, you must begin your sentences
with one of the above commands.  Use "say" if you wish everyone in the room
to hear you (unless they are asleep - characters who are asleep are
incommunicado, except to the Staff). "Tell," "whisper" and "ask" are used
to keep your conversations private and must be accompanied by the name of
the player with whom you wish to converse.  "Whisper" and "ask" can only
be used if the player you want to converse with is the same room.  "Tell"
is for global communication.  You can "tell" anyone who is awake, is not
in a dark room or invis and has tell on, no matter where they are in the
mud.
Please do not ask the Staff to tell a person that you can't reply to them.
You will have to wait until they are visible and do it yourself.
Note:  "tell" is a user command, and is only available to make the game
more playable.
Syntax:  toggle tell
Toggling "tell" will effectively allow you to toggle off this line of
communication.  However, it will not prevent a staff member from speaking
to you.

Ass
Ass - Last Edited: 2008-03-26 18:05:50 by Blaize
================================================
Ass, is short for being "on one's ass."  While on one's ass, melee
damage received is greatly increased (about x2 damage).
One can voluntarily put himself on his ass.  Simply recline.
Additionally, one can knock another to his ass via a successful
bodyslam and sometimes with a successful trip.
When a mercenary fails a tackle, they often end up assed for a long
time. Sometimes a failed bash results in being assed, likewise.
Should one flee while in a reclined position, he will simply
scramble to his feet rather than failing entirely like most other
actions.

====================================================
Assassins are practitioners of death and stealth, always lurking down dark
alleys and just around the corner and ready to commit a convenient act of
murder if it suits them. Assassins are adept at the art of concealment and
deception, but have sacrificed complete mastery of these abilities for keen
knowledge of anatomy and close quarter combat, thereby allowing them to cause
crippling and fatal damage to their foes with the devastating backstab.
Assassins are by far the most deadly creatures around if they catch you by
surprise and happen to be carrying their favorite daggers with them.

Auction Bid
Auction Bid - Last Edited: 2015-07-09 16:41:27 by lohrr
=======================================================
Auc Bid is used to bid on the items you chose to bid on from the list.
You must do 2 things to bid on items:
* have the coins in your inventory
* be at the auction house.
General Usage:
  auc bid <item id> <amount in platinum>
To bid 300 platinum on item number 21, one would type:
  auc bid 21 300
The global auctioning committee has deemed it as against the interest
of the system to allow 'bid sniping' and has decreed that bidding late
in an auction will extend the auction term, unless using

Auction Offer
Auction Offer - Last Edited: 2017-09-19 00:44:29 by lohrr
=========================================================
Use this command at the Auction houses to sell your fine equipment to others.
Auctioning an item requires a few things:
* an item to be auctioned, and it must be in your inventory
* a few platinum on hand as the auction service charge
* some time to wait for someone to buy your item
As the person setting up the auction, you may specify (but are not required to) any of these:
* starting bid price (in platinum)
* buy it now price (in platinum)
* auction length (in days)
* number of items to auction (1 to 9)
General usage:
  auction offer <item> [start price] [buy-it-now price] [duration] [quantity]
For example, if you wanted to auction a steel sword you could it multiple ways:
* To auction the sword for 10 plat with the standard 2 day timer:
  auc offer sword 10
* To auction the sword for 10 plat with the standard 2 day timer, or someone can buy it now for 50 plat:
  auc offer sword 10 50
* To auction the sword for 10 plat with a 4 day timer, or someone can buy it now for 50 plat:
  auc offer sword 10 50 4
* To auction 5 of the sword for 10 plat with a 4 day timer, or someone can buy it now for 50 plat
  auc offer sword 10 50 4 5
Note: You must actually have 5 of the same sword in your inventory to auction them as a bundle.
This is more useful for cheaper items such as potions.

Players can access the auction services from generally anywhere they
find themselves in the world of Duris. Auctions are an amazing way to
acquire high level equipment with minimal effort.
The global auctioning committee has worked long and arduously
coordinating Human, Halfling, Orc, and Duergar Dwarf
efforts to allow this civilized form of bartering. In order to maximize
the market, the committee has magically interconnected all auction houses
allowing even the shadiest Duergar Dwarf to sell to the most righteous
paladin and vice versa.
The global auctioning committee has created magical portals that allow
you to use the auction commands from anywhere in the game, granted
you haven't recently engaged in PvP.
Additionally, there are many auction houses throughout the world where
players can use the auction services at any time.
Currently they are located in:
* Tharnadia: Tharnadian Auction House
* Woodseer: Vendurini's Auction House
* Winterhaven: The Auction House
* Shady Grove: Auction Mound
Auction commands can be abbreviated to one letter (for example: instead
of "auction list sort head" you can type "auc l s head")
The currently available commands at auction houses are:
* auction list: see what is available at the auction
* auction offer: offer something to be sold at auction
* auction bid: place a bid
* auction info: find out stats on an item that is up for auction
* auction pickup: pickup items or cash from the auction house
These commands are available at any time, except for a short period after
removing a worn piece of equipment.

Avarne is a forest country that lies in the easternly part of the KK continent.  Within Avarne's forest are many creatures such as the tor, treant, and bandit swashbuckers.  These are excellent for hunting.  Deeper inside Avarne lies a community of Thri-Kreens, one of which is rumored to keep track of the artifacts in the lands of Duris.  There are two sets of temples, one belonging to those of the Star Worshippers, and the other belonging to the Sun Worshippers.  Little is known about the Castle of Avarne, except there is rumored to be a quest for the Kings blade of Aravne, requiring 13 heads of various leaders in Avarne country.

capable of all the spells and skills of those classes. The four clerics
themselves are left in a state of sleep until the avatar is lost or dies,
and their actual bodies are in no danger if the avatar is attacked.

Avengers are the faithful servants of Gods, bringing justice to their evil
enemies. They are recruited from the most dedicated paladins willing to
sacrifice their lives entirely to the God's service. A Paladin becomes an
Avenger through Ascension, when he or she sacrifices the ability to enjoy
mortal pleasures and is imbued with God's might. Avengers no longer see like
other mortals, thus cannot be blinded. They are surrounded by holy light and
their eyes emanate with internal glow. Rumors say they are able to paralyze
their foes solely through staring at them.
==Equipment usage==
The Avengers can use all kinds of heavy armors but limit themselves to
powerful, 2-handed swords only.

that is in the same room. The total amount of levels that can be charmed is
based on the level of the character and victims above level 36 are not
possible to control. Awe heavily depends on the psionisict's power strength.
In addition, highly intelligent victims are less likely to become awed.

Backranking refers to the process of being in a group with 3 or more
players, and typing group back. Only one person can backrank in a group
of 3, and 2 in a group of 5.  Being backranked you will not be able to
be engaged by another player or mob. You may not be harmed by physical
attacks from players, however mobs and magical attacks can still reach
you. In the backranked position you can also memorize or pray spells
without care of being disrupted. The backranked position is mainly used
in raiding, and is often reserved for casters and priests.

Backstab
Backstab - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 22:00:58 by ashyel
=====================================================
Syntax: backstab <victim>
A backstab is an attempt to sneak up on the victim and place a weapon in
the victim's back at exactly the point where it will do the most damage.
The amount of damage incurred is dependent on the proficiency of the
backstabber and is modified by:
- The weapon being used.  A weapon with better overall damage will also be
  better for backstabbing with.  Number of dice matters more than size, though
  very slightly.
- If the victim has aware.
- If the victim is in melee.
- If the victim is guarded.
- If the victim is sleeping or incapacitated.
- Damroll, skill level, strength and dexterity all modify the damage as well.
A player character may attempt to save damage against repeated stabs, or while under the affect
of aware. When under the affect of aware or being a victim of multiple
stab attempts, the character now has a chance to roll a save, halving the stab
damage. The roll is based on: Victim's Intelligence vs. Stabber's Agility + Backstab Skill.
Higher Intelligence gives a victim a higher chance to save against repeated/aware
stab attempts, higher agility gives the attacker a better chance to succeed full damage.
Note: Mountain and Duergar Dwarves are immune to the aware check when backstabbing
their victim.
You may only backstab with piercing weapons. Assassins with good enough
proficiency at dual wielding weapons may double-backstab if they wield two
piercing weapons.
You cannot backstab someone who is in a single file room.

depends upon the type of bandage. The higher your skill the better you apply the
bandage and the faster you heal. It is possible to destroy the bandage while the
skill is low.  There are three styles: a gauze bandage, a gauze tourniquet and a

Barbarians are large ill-tempered beings of the Northern
Tribes of Ugta. The cold terrain from which they come serves
to mask their strong scent, yet most still agree that the
company of a Barbarian is best enjoyed from afar. Surprisingly,
Barbarians are quite agile for their size which grants them
the unique ability to fight exceptionally well when taken by
surprise. This has helped transform their brutish reputation
into one of heroic nature. Barbarians are the best all around
fighters bar none, with a mean disposition to fit. They are
often described as brutes or brawlers, with little regard for
manners or thought. Occasionally, the rare individual will
attempt to utilize his head for something more then a butting
contest.
Barbarians are rugged individuals with impressive
hand-to-eye coordination and heroic strength making them
superior to their counterparts in all but wit.

Bard
Bard - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 20:58:11 by ashyel
=================================================
Blessed with the talent of music, Bards can, with practice, play any instrument.  These instruments can invoke magical tunes and songs that act as spells, aiding a party during their adventures.  Bards are a thief/mage/warrior hybrid by nature, and possess some of the advantages of all of those classes. They are true "Jacks of all Trades" which means they have many skills and spells, but are master of none.
==Equipment usage==
Bards can use a mixture of rogue and caster items and weapons.
==Playstyle==
The role of a  Bard can vary depending on a character's playstyle and is a good class for someone who likes all aspects of play: subtlety, support, damage, defensive.
Standard Operation:
 Bards are masters of song, and as such they can play songs. Different songs become
available at different levels and can be viewed by checking skills (type skills in game).
Songs tick passively when active, meaning once you start playing a song it will continue to
pulse until stopped by the character or manually stopped by invoking play in game.
Offense:
 Bards can output damage through some of their songs, melee abilities such as backstab and sneaky strike, as well as through their spells (type spells in game).  In order to maximize these skills a  Bard should focus development on intelligence, for use in spellcasting and a combination of strength, dexterity and agility for optimizing their thief/rogue skills such as Backstab.
Support and Defense:
 Bards have unique defensive abilities which automatically trigger in combat, as well as
some rogue abilities such as hide and sneak. Additionally, a number of bard songs provide support spells to group members affected by them.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   chant mastery, advanced meditation, sneaky strike, shield combat, toughness, improved endurance, empower song, fix, smelt, infuse magical device, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damanage control.

Bash
Bash - Last Edited: 2013-04-26 15:44:48 by targ
===============================================
Syntax:         bash <victim>
To bash someone is to attempt to knock that person over. If you succeed,
you will inflict minor damage and cause the victim to fall down. Both you
and the victim will then be unable to respond to any commands for a short
duration. If you fail to bash successfully, you will lose your balance and
fall. It is impossible to bash someone who is sitting/resting already. It is
much easier to bash someone if you are using a shield. Some creatures
may be unbashable due to size or other considerations.
A successful bash depends upon the dexterity of the basher and the agility
of the target. Characters with higher dexterity will be successful more often.
NOTE: Bash will not work in places where there is no footing.

Berserk
Berserk - Last Edited: 2008-12-04 14:48:29 by Blaize
====================================================
Syntax:         berserk
Berserk represents a massive adrenaline rush and more or less mindless
rage, that has the following affects:
	Strength and Constitution increase.
	Dexterity and Agility decrease.
	Intelligence and Wisdom decrease.
        Physical damage incurred is decreased.
        Arcane (spell) damage incurred is increased.
As a result, you will most likely gain hits and do more damage. These
changes to stats are based on your natural abilities and bonuses from
magic items or spells apply normally. This is one of the ways a stat can
exceed the 1-100 limit.
If you wish, you can start or stop a berserker rage by typing "berserk",
level and skill heavily affect the results of doing this. If a mob or
player walks into a room while you are berserked and not engaged in battle
at the time, you will automatically attack them. When berserk wears off,
you will lose the bonus hitpoints from Constitution and if this drops you
below -10 hitpoints, you will die.
Certain races and classes enjoy an intrinsically superior berserk rage.

Berserker
Berserker - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:04:45 by ashyel
======================================================
Howling screams, whirling whips, snacking on danger and dining on death.
Berserkers attack in a focused battle rage that can grant them many advantages on the battlefield, but their style tends to be sloppier than that of warriors and lacking somewhat in shield skill, causing them to take more damage in combat.  Many have been known to wield 2 handed weapons with a fury almost unmatched.
Their rage tends to cause them to focus totally on a single target at a time. So while in their younger years they tend to attack more than warriors, as they age, they learn to switch targets quite effectively.
Bards sing of rumors that some Berserkers have found a way to increase their size. Whether these stories are true or not, it is not truly known. They are said to pray to the ancient gods of the Nordic Lands. Such names as Odin, Loki, Thor, Beretorn, and Kvasir. What powers are granted by these beings is a closely guarded secret. Only the ancient dervish knows the true power that can be
unleashed. He dominates the Raven Realms dealing out death to those that
dare travel where they were never meant to be.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   anatomy, shield combat, two weapon fighting, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, indomitable rage, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control.

the strength of lightning greatly increases their fighting speed and finesse, at
the cost of pure fighting strength. However, the blinding speed and shock factor
of their combat easily makes up for this weakness.

A Forest Druid has the ability to cast a spell to summon aid
from the creatures of the forest near him.  The type of animal

================================================
Syntax:         camp
When you are adventuring by road, it is often not advantageous to continue
your journey through the night, so Duris has a "Camp" option. Locate a safe
place to camp for the night and then type "camp". You must then wait a
period of time before you can exit the game. If you leave the room in which
you are trying to set up camp or if you fight, camping will automatically
cancel. Once you fully camp, you will be sent to the main menu, just as
when you rent.
Should you choose to 'camp abort', 'camp stop' or 'camp off', you will stop attempting to set up camp.
Warning: If you go link-dead, camping will stop
(linkdead rent does *not* reset your homeroom).

Cast
Cast - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 22:04:20 by ashyel
=================================================
Syntax: cast "<spell>" [<object>|<victim>]
"Cast" is a command used to indicate that a spell is being created. It is
the act of invoking the gods or calling upon magical powers inside the
individual. Some spells may only be cast on the caster, and therefore you
do not need to indicate a target for the spell. If you are casting a spell
upon yourself, you may substitute for your name "me" or "self." All spell
names must be enclosed by " ". For Magic-User subclasses, you must have a
spellbook containing the spell you want to cast in order to memorize it.
For Priest sub-classes, you may simply pray for your spells. Undeads,
except for Gargoyles, must assimilate spells. Finally, Druids regain their
spells by communing them.
Examples:       cast "burning hands" <victim>
                cast "teleport"
                cast "strength" me
If you are casting an offensive spell while in combat, and the target is
the enemy you are fighting, the spell will automatically be directed at the
enemy without having to define a target.
There is help available for each individual spell (see examples below).
Examples:      	help "cure light"
                help "minor creation"
                help "energy drain"
NOTE:  You can abbreviate the spell name when casting it.  For example,
                > cast "lightning bolt" <monster>
                could be abbreviated as:
                > cast "ligh" <monster>
You must be careful however when abbreviating to insure that the correct
spell is cast because many spells have similar names and the abbreviations
may not be obvious at once. Experimentation in a safe forum is the best
idea to insure that no disasters occur.

Caster
Caster - Last Edited: 2007-04-19 19:17:10 by Unknown
====================================================
Caster is a term that is used to described Magic User and Priest classes. It is used in referring to classes that are highly adept in the magical arts and who focus their studies solely on these crafts. Casters
include Clerics, Conjurers, Warlocks, Ethermancers, Druids, Necromancers, Shamans, Psionicists, Illusionists and Sorcerers. Casters receive no penalties to their casting abilities.
The term Semi-Caster denotes an entirely different set of classes who, while not being as proficient in the magical arts, do dabble in the mystic areas. Because they do not devote their lives to the practice of magic, they have special hindrances. While being able to use many of the same spells as casters, semi-casters can only hold half the number of spells in
their repertoire that a caster of same level can. In addition, because they are not as trained in magic, they find it a bit more difficult to memorize their incantations and to call on their deities for divine powers. Hence, semi-casters must take a little additional time in preparing their magic.
Semi-casters include Anti-Paladins, Paladins, Rangers, Reavers, and Bards.

====================================================
A Cenobite is a multi-classed Cleric/Druid combination.
This multiclass can be trained by Human Clerics or Human Druids, with unique benefits to each choice.
The Cleric who chooses to become a Cenobite will gain the use of many powerful Druid spells while retaining his or her Good alignment, allowing him to use good-only spells like Holy word.
The Druid who chooses this path will remain neutrally aligned, gaining most Cleric abilities except those that rely on a cleric's innate goodness.  Druid based Cenobite will, however, retain the power of Commune, which is a powerful, nature inspired form of spell renegeration.
**Choose wisely when deciding how to begin your path to this unique and powerful class.**

Centaur
Centaur - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 20:01:16 by ashyel
====================================================
Centaurs are a half horse, half human race, with the upper half looking
like a human, and the lower half looking like a large draft horse.
Centaurs are quiet, forest dwelling creatures from a far off forest
covered land. Being a secluded race, Centaurs are shy and slow to trust.
Centaur have been known to allow close friends to ride upon their saddled
backs. Flailing hooves will greet one who mounts without prior consent.
Centaur are a very powerful race and have both great strength and hearty
constitution. Being 1/2 horse, they can out-distance any other race in
the world, being able to travel miles a day without growing tired.
Centaur Rangers are so good with the bow that they gain a +2 to hit and
a +1 on damage, due to their great strength. Their flighty nature and
awareness with their environment allows them to be always AWARE and thus
it is difficult to backstab them.
Due to their odd body shape, Centaur cannot be bashed by any creature
of smaller stature.
Centaur can't wear anything on their legs or feet. It is said they wear
tail rings to attract those of opposite gender.
==Weakness==
Warning: Centaurs are a flighty race by nature, and thus ALWAYS flee when
they hear the roar of a dragon. In fact, they flee quite a lot. It is said
that a certain song sung by the Bards of Duris may calm Centaurs, thus
allowing them to face the might of dragons.

Channel
Channel - Last Edited: 2007-04-19 19:17:10 by Unknown
=====================================================
Channel is one of the most powerful spells of a cleric and should be used
with great caution. It requires four clerics over level 50 to work, and
creates an avatar bringing the power of all the clerics together. First,
all the clerics must be grouped and consenting to "lead" cleric. They begin
casting the spell together until the avatar appears. The lead cleric then
takes control of the avatar, while the other clerics can simply watch. The
actual body of the clerics are left laying asleep where they are, but the
"lead" cleric, in avatar form, can move around, cast, etc.
Warning: If ANY one of the clerics loses link during the avatar process,
the avatar will vanish. There IS a time limit on how often clerics can
avatar.

=================================================
Chanting is a talent developed by monks used to further enhance their
martial arts skills. There are a number of different chants available to
monks, all varying in power and purpose.
*     Heroism - Heroism elevates the amount of adrenaline produced by the chanter
and stimulates the centers of the mind controlling dexterity and balance,
resulting in increased combat abilities. For the follower of the 'Way of
the Snake' this rush of adrenaline also increases speed and movement while
the Dragon Disciples become immune to fear.
*     Calm - Calm soothes whoever or whatever might be angry at the chanter or
his friends. This chant has the capability of ceasing combat in certain
situations.
*     Quivering Palm - This chant causes the chanter's hand to vibrate so fast it
can barely be seen. The hand then strikes out at equally fast speeds,
inflicting formidable damage upon its target.
*     Regenerate - When chanting Regenerate, the monk heals at a much faster
rate.
*     Buddha Palm - Buddha Palm, much like Quivering Palm, causes the monk's
hands to vibrate at unbelievable speeds. However, the Buddha Palm strikes
out with both hands at lightning speed at as many adversaries as it can.
*     Chi Purge - This ability allows the monk to focus his or her chi, curing
their body of the more detrimental maladies in the realm of Duris. What affects
it is capable of curing, however, is greatly dependent on the skill in this area
and the level of the monk.

====================================================
The location of Charing was lost during the great war.
Charing is a small quiet forest community set in the northeastern corner of
Evermeet Continent that welcomes Elf, Centaur and Half-elf visitors. What
it lacks in size it makes up in beauty. Massive oak tress filled with
birds, small creatures and sparkling rivers make for the most serene
setting. In the southeast section of the forest stands the Great Tree of
Charing. Here is your gateway to the city above.
The Palace of the City of Charing is the host for many of the Elven
dignitaries. Towering behind a pair of impressive gates, the spires are
truly one to be seen. Just south of the Palace on the "Way of the Royals"
is the Warriors guild, where the impressive guardians of Charing train.
Continuing south is a beautiful fountain in the shape of a mermaid, this is
also the center of town. Heading down the east trail takes you past several
entertainment areas. You have the Grovetree Theatre, the home of the
renowned Grovesinger"s Troupe, who are said to give the highest quality of
performance almost anywhere. After the performance shop by and let Nelanna
serve up some of the local brew.
Continuing down the trail is the Tower of High Magic. Hundreds of students
a year stop here hoping to study with the most respected sorceress
Morlyntra and her brother conjurer Morlander. When the hunger strikes you,
head back to the west of the trail and stop by The Blue Dragon Restaurant.
Gaston Reglia the master chef is noted for his elegant meals and the
seating is limited! West of the restaurant is the Rangers guild. A small
wooden structure that offers Rangers from all around a safe place to train
and hold council. If you would like to join them in their daily hunts,
Alkatia"s Fletcher shop just south of the fountain offers a fine selection
of longbows, arrows and quivers. Keep going south of Alkatia"s and you"ll
find the Bank of Charing and finally you can settle the end of the day at
the Olde Inn of Charing across the street.

Circling is an attempt to outflank an opponent in battle and to attack from
unexpected positions.  When successful, the victim will find it much more
difficult to dodge and parry the rogue's vicious attack and will take
considerably more damage.  Circle cannot be initiated when the rogue is
tanking.
"Circle" also refers to spheres of knowledge of spell casting classes, with
higher circles denoting more powerful groups of spells. Spell casters (all
Mage and Priest sub-classes) and "semi-casters" (Rangers, Paladins, and
Anti-Paladins) gain in circle at levels 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 41, and

Clap - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
==================================================
Clap is a social command, or an Emote. Typing this command will allow you to Clap, using preprogrammed commands. The benefits of using these commands will allow you in one word to sum up a long phrase, and social commands are sometimes used as triggers. More often they are a nice simple command to express yourself. The command list is as follows.
Clap = You clap your small hands together.
Clap me/self = You clap your small hands together.
Clap (target name) = You clap your small hands together.

==================================================
Your class, in the world of duris, is basically your character's profession.  When creating your character you are given a choice based on your race of what class you would like to be.  Note that certain races are better suited for certain classes depending on the type of character you would like to play.  For example a Grey Elf would make an excellent cleric as they are quick and are naturally blessed with a high wisdom, however a Mountain Dwarf may also make an excellent cleric, they will not be as wise as their Grey Elf counterparts but they will have a greater constitution and therefore more hitpoints. This allows for a greater variety of characters and lets you choose one which better suits your specific playstyle.
Classes can be further customized by Specializations|specialization to fit how you want your character to be.
Following is a listing of the available classes on duris:
-Warrior
-Mercenary
-Rogue
-Bard
-Conjurer
-Summoner
-Sorcerer
-Psionicist
-Druid
-Cleric
-Ethermancer
-Monk
-Paladin
-Anti-Paladin
-Berserker
-Ranger
-Reaver
-Illusionist
-Alchemist
-Shaman
-Necromancer
-Blighter
You are also given the option to multiclass on duris, note that only orc|orcs and human|humans have this option and not all classes can.

Once you have selected the race of being you wish to play, you must select
a class. A class is the trade or profession at which your character will
excel. Not all classes are available for each race, as it would be highly
unlikely that an unintelligent, clumsy troll would take up the demanding
profession of assassin. There are four main "types" of classes (Fighters,
Priests, Rogues and Magic User|Magic-Users) available, and the available classes are
listed below the headings of each one.

Cleric
Cleric - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:00:38 by ashyel
===================================================
Clerics utilize the powers given to them on behalf of the Gods to keep themselves and their party members alive. In addition, they have a large assortment of protection spells to allow the members of their groups to take less damage, making their job as a healer easier. In order to optimize their memorization and spellcasting, Clerics rely heavily on wisdom and agility.
Certain races are allowed to specialize their cleric into the following classes:
The Zealot: a fierce (un)holy warrior that gains offensive spells and skills.
The Healer: a master of the healing arts.
The Holyman: graced by the Gods to shield their body and soul with (un)holy wards.
While the primary nature of a Cleric is to protect and heal his party members, he does have enough limited offensive spells to keep his adventuring life diversified. Clerics have access to planar travel (Plane Shift), Word of Recall and the powerful Resurrection spells.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   anatomy, devotion, shield combat, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, infuse magical device, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control
==Equipment usage==
Like all classes on Duris, Clerics have their own specific item restrictions. They are restricted in their use of weapons, mainly using maces, clubs and staves. Some exceptions are allowed, however. They can wear almost any type of armor, but also rely heavily on strong constitution for their self-defense.

Coder
Coder - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
===================================================
Coders of the MUD are a series of self correcting algorithms, usually the
process is started by a smaller script such as the "Alver", "Dvorak" or
"Nokz" scripts. These work fine for most features but occasionally enter
higher level functions and cause additional "features" which then need to
pass through the "Tharkun" or "Ilienze" functions which restore the
functions to their original code then rewrite them from scratch. The fabled
Foo is a mostly unknown to Duris, but oddly his name is scratched to the
bottom of each boat. If a Foo appears, most coder scripts will accept his
function calls, except the "Kvark".

While a monk is engaged with another creature, one of the monk's most damaging abilities is its
combination attack.  It takes a couple rounds to setup, but during this time the monk may (and
should) use another ability such as his/her dragon punch or springleap (just don't fall down
before the combination attack would go off).  As the monk increases in level, the combination
attack will include more attacks and eventually it may even stun the target.

Unlike most spellcasters, Druids do not need to memorize or pray. They have
allied themselves with the natural world so well that they commune with
their surroundings to derive the natural essence that is necessary for
their spells. This essence is more abundant in untamed wilds. What this
means is, Druids will regenerate their spells while standing idle at a rate
that  varies dependent on what terrain they are in.

Conjurer
Conjurer - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 20:58:48 by ashyel
=====================================================
Conjurers are the creative branch of the magic-users. They specialize in enchantments, conjuring creatures, and objects. They are the only ones able to identify objects.
Conjurers, like other magic-users, possess awesome spell casting might and are able to throw some of the world's most potent spells.  The conjuring style of magic first developed among the mixed breed races,
which would account for their smaller spell list and greater overall spell potency.
Conjurers have fewer offensive spells than Sorcerers, yet have some of the best defensive spells on Duris. The spells Stone Skin, Globe of Invulnerability, and Stornogs Spheres can shield the Conjurer in protective magics requiring considerable effort to penetrate.  While the Conjurer is quite capable of defending himself, he is physically lacking in brawn, making constitution an important attribute when developing him.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   chant mastery, summon familiar, advanced meditation, scribe mastery, silentspell, shield combat, infuse life, spell penetration, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, infuse magical device, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck, and ship damage control.
==Equipment usage==
As all classes on Duris, Conjurers have their own classification of item restriction. They have a very small range of weapons they can use and a small range of armor to choose from. They have very little restrictions on what miscellaneous magical items they can use, though.
==Pet/Minion Control==
Conjurers use the spells 'conjure elemental' and 'conjure greater elemental' to create pets.  These pets are based on the element the Conjurer has specialized in or present randomly if they have yet to choose a specialization.  The level of control a Conjurer gains over his pets is directly affected by his intelligence and charisma.

"Consent" is a check performed by the MUD code in order to confirm that a
player (victim) is agreeing to the action being performed upon him or her
by another player.
Usage:
consent <name> -you give your undying trust to <name>
consent        -you revoke consent
consent who    -lists all players that have given you consent
You may only consent to one person at a time, but you can change it as
often as you wish. The person you are consenting to need not be in the
room with you, but you must be able to see him/her. (If who <name> doesn"t
work, neither will consent <name>).

Corpse - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
====================================================
A corpse is a cadaver left behind after a mob or person has been killed.  A corpse will decay after a small amount of time, and the spell "preserve" is used to delay such action.  Corpses often contain coins and gear, and sometimes can contain hidden items found by "search corpse".  A PC's corpse can be resurrected by the cleric spell "resurrection" allowing the player to return to the spot of the corpse, and retain some of the exp lost upon death.  Corpses are the main tool that necromancers utilize upon raising inanimate beings.

With a corpse at their feet, Corpseform will transform the caster into the

Due to the heavy concentration required while using this spell the caster may not

Cr - Last Edited: 2009-04-17 23:14:39 by Blaize
===============================================
A cr is a acronym for "corpse retrieval".
After the death of your character, you will return to the game without your
personal items. To get your items back, you have to travel to the location
where you died and retrieve your corpse. Your items will be on your corpse,
unless they have been looted by someone else.
A cr can be simple, or it can be very time-consuming and complicated. It is
always a wise move to leave a ''sitter'' if you are doing a difficult zone.

Cramped
Cramped - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
=====================================================
A cramped room is a very tiny pathway with only 2 exits.
When entering a cramped room, all players and mobs are forced into a single file line, and may only cast spells and engage those who are next to them.  Additionally, only those near the exits may leave the room normally.  All others will bump into those who are standing in the room.
To get through a cramped room, one should recline.  Moving while in such position results in a squirming action, which while is not always effective, can get through the cramped room.  It is much too difficult to squirm past those who are fighting in a cramped room.
Area spells and transportation spells are also unusable in cramped rooms.
While mounted, one cannot fit through these tiny pathways.

Death - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown

When you die, you re-enter the game at your birthplace (where you started
the game). You can retrieve your corpse by traveling to where you died and
getting the items from inside. Each time you die you lose a percentage of
experience for your level. It is wise to be careful to avoid death when you
have recently gained a level. If the experience lost due to death is more
than you have gained in your current level, you will "lose a level" and the
maximum hitpoint difference between the two levels. If you were killed by
another player of an opposite racewar side, it is possible that you will
also lose "Frags".

Deathknight

========================================================
The Death Knight is a twisted form of a Lich. A race of undead warriors
spawned by a demon prince (popular thought credits Demogorgon), from fallen
human paladins. No one knows exactly why this was done except for the
obvious explanation: The raising of an army that was never used. The
perverted soul of the former paladin lives through eternal torment in its
undead state, killing anything that will satisfy its rage at what has been
done to it.
Death knight stats:    Unlike Liches, Death Knights wear heavy armor and
                       the weapons of warriors. They will usually be riding
                       a nightmare which they often summon to do their
                       bidding.

After a set amount of time all corpses will decay. Corpses of NPCs will
decay and leave the equipment scattered on the floor. After a crash or
reboot, these corpses are not loaded. Corpses of players will decay in time
following a death. The equipment will also be scattered on the ground. So,
following a death, it is important to retrieve your corpse in a timely
manner. Corpses of players will, however, load after a reboot or crash.
Player corpses currently decay after approximately 2 hours. The decay time
is reset if the game reboots or crashes before the corpse has decayed. The
spells preserve and embalm may prolong the time until a corpse decays.

Desolate
Desolate - Last Edited: 2007-04-19 19:17:10 by Unknown
======================================================
Desolate is a quaint forest town located not far
from the searing desert sands and the Savannah of sorrow.
The road leading up to the town is patrolled by many
militia guards who watch for evil invaders. The town
itself has a ban on using magic in an attempt to prevent
conflicts and disasters. Perhaps one of the redeeming
qualities of this prohibitive town is the existence of a
bank to make deposits and withdrawls as well as as inn.
For players, Desolate offers a wide range of mobs on which
to gain experience for most levels as well as an
assortment of mid to high-level equipment and quests.
It is known that the Army of Armageddon has encamped
at the beach and does not trust players of good alignment.
They have also attempted to attack and invade Desolate in
the past, and players should watch out for signs of the
dark army's return, as it can turn the peaceful little
township into a vicious and dangerous warground even for
the experienced.

Disguise
Disguise - Last Edited: 2015-01-05 18:20:16 by ashyel
=====================================================
Through a combination of proper equipment and skill a player may disguise his appearance from others, appearing as a mob or even another player. In order to do this, players need to purchase disguise kits at one of a few vendors throughout the realm.
The command to use these kits is to type 'disguise <intended disguise> while holding a  kit in your inventory.  To reverse the disguise and appear as yourself again, simply type 'disguise'.   A new kit will be required for each attempt to disguise, as it will be destroyed upon returning to your natural shape.
Stay aware of the condition of your kit by checking score.  Battle and time will wear down your disguise until eventually it fails and you are back to being yourself.   Also please note: Until you have obtained sufficiently high skill level in disguising, you are at risk of failing your attempt at it, destroying the kit and retaining your natural shape.

Doomlure
Doomlure - Last Edited: 2007-04-19 19:17:11 by Unknown
======================================================
To doomlure or immolure is to cause a mob to chase after you by way of wave-type spells. This tactic is used often when mobs are grouped together making it foolish and impractical to rush in.
A tank or pet is sent forward first, then the lurer enters, casts, and runs. A few words of warning, this tactic does not always work the first time. Problems arise then the tank does not flee soon enough, the pet lasts past the end of the spell, or the mob shrugged the spell. It is also noteworthy that mobs able to range their magic have been known to require the lurer to run farther or turn corners in order to lure properly.

Dreadlord
Dreadlord - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:10:36 by ashyel
======================================================
Dreadlords, also knows as the Eyeless, are the warlords of the undead. They
are the result of a dark and terrible ritual performed on a person. The end
of the ritual is marked by the person sacrificing his eyes by clawing them
out and then giving his life to the Dark Lords. If he is deemed worthy he
will once again rise, this time as an undead, a Dreadlord. If he is not
deemed worthy he has an eternity in the pits of hell to ponder his
arrogance. The loss of their eyes does not, as many believe, encumber the
Eyeless in any way. Instead they are giving a seventh sense by which they
can perceive their surroundings. This also makes them immune against
blindness and other things that would normally affect eyesight, such as
daylight and darkness, yet sensitive to extremes of heat. A Dreadlord is a
feared fighter, a master in the use of two-handed weapons, spreading the
taint of the dead as they fight. Even their blood can kill. They are also
trained in the art of leading and are deadly while commanding a force.
==Equipment usage==
Like all classes on Duris, Dreadlords have their own item restrictions.
They can use most heavy armor and weapons but are more limited in using
magical items.

Drow elf
Drow elf - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:22:27 by ashyel
=====================================================
Living far beneath the surface, deep within the bowels of the Underdark,
Drow Elves are a swift-moving, crafty, remorselessly wicked people ruled
by a society of priestesses who serve the demonic Spider Queen, Lloth.
The Drow are an extremely intelligent race, and their abilities and
ambition are feared and loathed by races throughout the Realms,
particularly Grey Elves, their distant cousins and blood enemies.
Because of the length of time they spend below the surface, Drow are hurt
by the natural light of the sun  and the light of fire. To compensate,
they have permanent ultravision, allowing them to see in total darkness.
However, they seldom travel to the surface, and never during the daytime.
Drow tend to be weaker and frailer than humans, but are better in most
other areas. Low level Drow are somewhat resistant to magical attacks, but
gain more resistance as they level.

Druid
Druid - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 20:56:24 by ashyel
==================================================
Druids are powerful priestly types that concentrate their discipline toward the betterment of nature and world preservation. They generally worship deities of the forest and of nature and will dispatch anyone attempting to desecrate or destroy a forest. Although their spell-like powers are primarily defensive in nature, they do command some very potent offensive magic once they attain the higher circles.
The Druid class does not pray for spells like other "priests" for they have shunned the pantheon of gods and allied themselves with the natural world instead. They must "commune" with their surroundings to derive the natural essence that is necessary for their spell slots to refill automatically as long as they are not fighting, casting, unconscious, etc.
It is unnecessary to designate a specific array of spells to memorize as the essence is automatically channeled into the highest circle that is not completely full before it is channeled into lower circles, thus it is impossible to prioritize what spells to regain first. The rate of spell recovery depends on the availability of natural essence in the Druid"s surroundings. This essence is readily available in forests, but becomes more scarce on other types of terrain, especially indoors or under ground. Overall, Druids have slower, more constant spell recovery but rely heavily on wisdom and agility to commune and cast their spells.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   summon blizzard, summon familiar, shield combat, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, infuse magical device, natures sanctity, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck, and ship damage control.
==Equipment Usage==
Druids fall under the Priest classification of item restriction. This means they are generally restricted to the use of non-edged weapons. Some exceptions are made depending on which deity the Druid worships. They can wear almost all types of armor, and are only mildly restricted in usage of certain miscellaneous magical items.

Dual Wield
Dual Wield - Last Edited: 2007-04-20 14:02:09 by Unknown
========================================================
"Dual Wield" allows you to wield a primary AND secondary weapon and to use
both to hit your opponent during combat. This, in effect, gives you an
extra attack per round. The success of the attack depends on your
proficiency in that particular area.
Note: While it is possible for other classes to wield two weapons at once,
they cannot practice this skill and the chances of their hitting an opponent
with a secondary weapon is very unlikely.

Duergar dwarf
Duergar dwarf - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:44:23 by ashyel
==========================================================
The duergar are an evil race of gray dwarves that live deep under the
surface of the world, within the depths of the Underdark.  Extremely
cunning and wicked creatures, duergar are known for their deceit and
evil ways. They hate all other races, except for the drow, with whom
they have grudging trade relations. They are mortal enemies of the
mountain dwarves.
Duergar are inordinately sturdy and strong, and have permanent ultravision.
Duergar are hurt by natural daylight, and therefore travel to the surface
rarely. They are somewhat smaller then humans.
Duergars can complete an in-game quest to become a Berserker.
==Strengths==
Mountain and Duergar Dwarves have survived long against magic. Thus, the
dwarves have developed a damage reduction innate towards the most general
magic.

Duris edit
Duris edit - Last Edited: 2008-08-22 20:24:07 by Jexni
======================================================
Duris Edit (Formerly Diku Edit) is a program used to create new zones for the
game. See below for off-site link to download the most recent version
(hopefully... DE is a project of someone not affiliated with Duris per se).
Getting Started:
Step One - Save your copy of Duris Edit into a new folder.
It's advisable to keep each zone's files in separate folders within your DE
folder, but keep in mind that DE will need to be copied into each folder to
edit your new zone.  For the purpose of this tutorial, I'll say my zone's
name is "uberzone".
Step Two - Open DE.exe.  DE will ask you if you are creating a new zone, or
working upon an already existing zone.  For a new zone, type 'N'.  Next you
will specify the name of the zone (and all associated files).
Step Three - After step two you should now have the Duris Edit window open
and you are free to create.  A listing of commands is available by typing
"command".  The help is somewhat limited, but includes enough information to
get by in most instances.
Editing a new zone:
Specify a starting vnum for rooms, objs, and mobs: For now, just go with 1
as your starting vnum (this number can be changed easily w/ the renumber
command when you are given a block of vnums from the staff).
Enter a new name for the zone: Kind of self explanatory here.  Ansi is
encouraged, but please be tasteful.
Zone's zone number is equal to 0 - specify a valid zone number: just go with
1(again this will be set by the staff upon submission).
And here you are in DE ready to write your zone.
----
Some Things to Keep in Mind:
Mapping your zone out on graph paper before beginning will help you to keep
track of your rooms, and also give you a better focus on what the theme of
your zone is(a well laid out zone is going to be more cohesive and make more
sense than one that runs all over and has rooms leading every which way).
Room descriptions should always start with a 3 space indent on the first line
and should be at least 4 lines in length. The length of each line should
generally go to about the 80th column without counting ansi codes.
   This is a formatted line of the correct length including several ansi codes.
Room Names should be capitalized the same way as titles:
The Dreaded and Much Feared Room of Ownage
Ansi is an art form! Read "help ansi" on the mud for more information on this.
Try not to create an eyesore as it will annoy the staff and generally degrade
the quality of the zone.
Most of all enjoy yourself. Writing a zone can take a long time, but if you're
having fun it's worth it.

The "emote" command allows you to creatively pretend that your
character is doing something that the available socials do not
currently allow.  For example, if Fizzwig wished everyone to think he
is a really nice guy, he might type:
        emote hands you 10000 pcoins.
                -or-
        : hands you 10000 pcoins.
This would be viewed as everyone in the room as:
        Fizzwig hands you 10000 pcoins.
Of course, Fizzwig has not really given anyone the coins, he just
wants everyone to think he has.
A quicker, equivalent command is ":"

====================================================
This skill will imbue a piece of equipment of your choosing with any spell
up to a certain power that is currently affecting the casting player.
There are some restrictions in the type of spells that may be enchanted.
- Artifacts cannot be enchanted.
- Offensive spells or any spells that are of the "self only" cast type cannot
be enchanted into the item.
- Only one enchant affect can be held on a piece of equipment at any one time
and the effect will wear off in the appropriate time span.
Enchanting an item can be an expensive exercise and you will need to carry
the necessary funds to use this skill. An enchanted item will display a flag
indicating that status if successful, however, beware that unsuccessful
enchant attempts may permanently damage the item in the process.
Example Syntax: enchant cloak 'vitality'
The knowledge of this ability is imparted by a Dwarven Smith within a Tribal
Oasis.

===================================================
Encrusting is one of the highly sought after Epic skills of the Alchemy.
By collecting various rare gems, the user can bind into other
equipment items the power of these stones.
The stones themselves can sometimes be found in the corpses of the more
fearsome and hard to kill creatures of Duris.
You will need to make sure that the equipment item and the stone you wish
to use for the "encrust" are both in your inventory then type:
     encrust item stone
For example if you have "a strange Green stone", and "a steel dagger", just
make sure both are in your inventory then type: encrust dagger stone
Warning: Encrusting an item, overwrites all existing procedures for that item.
This powerful ability is taught by the vagabond alchemist in the
Divine Home.
You cannot encrust an artifact.

"Energy Drain" literally drains the lifeblood from the victim, as it feeds
on the energy for itself. Although it does not do much damage to the
victim, a successful spell cast causes the victim to lose energy, and the
caster  to gain life force, movement points, and mana.
The gods consider such an act upon another living being extremely evil and
casting this spell will cause a player to become more and more evil aligned.

Ethermancer - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:01:44 by ashyel
========================================================
Calling on the power of storms, Ethermancers utilize the elements of ice and wind to smite their foes. Although offensive in nature, Ethermancers have the unique ability to dispel powerful magic where others cannot, and
can sometimes even steal it. Their bodies are composed mostly of ethereal matter which causes them to be resilient to physical attacks, yet more prone to magical attacks.  Through the development of heightened wisdom the ethermancer is able to boost spellcasting and memorization while simultaneously decreasing damage taken from magic. When walking, ethermancers leave a trail of frost,  allowing them to tread where others cannot go.
Ethermancers are more offensive than their Cleric counterparts and are less able to protect their group.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   summon blizzard, devotion, shield combat, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, infuse magical device, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control.

Banks can be found throughout the Realms, and it is the wise adventurer
indeed that utilizes them often. Carrying large amounts of money around
with you can be hazardous: you could not only lose the cash you are
carrying if you die, but you would also be welcome prey to any thief.
You can also "exchange" the money that you are carrying for that of smaller
or higher denominations, usually for some surcharge. See below for correct
syntax.
The following commands can be used at any banks:
        BALANCE
        DEPOSIT <amount> <coin_type>
        WITHDRAW <amount> <coin_type>
        EXCHANGE <amount> <coin_type> <desired_coin_type>
Examples of monetary exchange:
        exchange 1000 gcoins pcoins
        exchange 1000 copper platinum
        exchange 5 platinum scoin
The standard Duris currency values equate as:
        10 copper =1 silver
        10 silver =1 gold
        10 gold =1 platinum

======================================================
Syntax:   exp (to see how much experience you currently have)
Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. Once
you have earned enough experience, you raise a level in your class. Duris
has 56 mortal levels, 56 for multiclasses as well; you can check your progress
by typing "experience". The levels after 46 are only received by gaining epic
points. After level 50, receiving epics from a zone specified for your next level
is required to attain that next level, provided you have the necessary experience
and have earned the total amount of required epic points.
Here are a few things you should know about experience points:
-Humans and Orcs gain an experience bonus, which might make them desirable classes for newer players.  This also comes in handy when multiclassing (see: Help multiclass), as these characters are required to level twice.
-Each pulse you hit or miss a monster when you are engaged you get experience points.
-Healing a person who is in combat and grouped with you will give you a lot of experience points.
-You get exp for each spell you cast upon a monster or a player in your group if you are in combat.
The amount of experience points received depends on which circle the spells is in.
You also receive experience points for using skills in combat, such as bash, backstab, kick and so on.
-If you kill a monster of a higher level than yourself, you get bonus experience points.
-If you kill a monster of a lower level, you will gain less experience points.
-Rested and well rested bonuses (bonuses obtained after staying offline for a certain amount of time) will apply a higher level of exp temporarily.  (See Rested for details)
The amount of experience you receive depends on the type of monster you kill as well.

The Fighter, as the name suggests, is a class that involves hand-to-hand
combat most extensively. They are usually the first to charge into battle
and are almost always the ones that stand at the head of a fighting group
("acting as tank," it is commonly called). They sustain most of the battle
damage.
Fighters represent a group of classes into which Berserkers, Warriors,
Rangers, Reavers, Paladins, Anti-Paladins, Monks and Dreadlords are grouped.
Each sub-class has its own experience chart according to which they gain
levels.

hunt you down in various manners to try and continue the fight, so be

Fleeing is not an effortless action. Extracting yourself from a life or

This spell creates a shield of shadows around the group and negates almost
all physical damage to the victims. It lasts until duration expires or a
variable number of attacks (of any type, whether they hit or do damage)
are made against the victim.  The number of attacks it protects against
varies with level and proficiency of caster. If a particularly damaging
attack is made, it will provide no protection at all. Does not block damage
from magic spells (though these attacks WILL 'chip away' at the protection).
NewsNote: On March 13th, 2006 Flicker was implemented. It had long been a

Syntax: forage
"Ingredients" are located throughout the world of Duris, buried under the
ground. In order to retrieve these ingredients, you must "Forage" for them.
Some classes, such as Alchemists and Forest Druids (specialized Druids),
need specific ingredients in order to cast spells or mix potions.
Warning: While foraging, you cannot enter new commands for a period of
time, making you prone to attack. So, be sure you are relatively
safe before foraging!

Syntax:     frag
            frag <classname>
            frag <racename>
            frag <racewarsidename>
The term "frag", originally taken from the Vietnam War, is when you kill
another player. When you kill someone who is an opposite racewar side
(a Human killing a Drow, etc) you get a frag if you are within 10 levels
of them. When you are killed by someone who is an opposite racewar side
(a Gnome being killed by a Ogre, ect) you lose a frag if within 10 levels
of them. All frags are split between the group equally accounting for all
the players of that side in the room. So, if you are with a group of five
people and you kill one player, you will each receive .20 frags. Likewise,
if you are alone and four others are in the room when you kill one player,
you alone will receive .20 frags. Typing "fraglist" will show a list of
the top ten and lowest ten fraggers in the mud. Or, you may type "frag
<racewarside>", "frag <classname>" or "<frag racename>".
Once a player has more than 20 frags, he or she will not gain frags for
slaying anyone under level 40.

===========================================================
* Area of effect: <room>

* Type of spell: Transportation
Gate to Ard'gral opens up a gate to Ard'gral the Quasi-Elemental plane of dreams, where rifts open up to all parts of the world and other planes. Here's how Plane of Ard'gral works: there are gateways that lead to random spots on surface, and they're random when you enter them. So if person A enters the gateway, and person B immediately enters the same gateway, you could wind up on different parts of map. Now there are rifts and pools (much like on Ethereal Plane) to other planes (Astral Plane|Astral, Ethereal Plane|Ethereal, Elemental Plane of Earth|Earth, Elemental Plane of Water|Water, Elemental Plane of Fire|Fire, Elemental Plane of Air|Air). There are also a couple of rifts to other "fixed" zones like Bloodstone, Vella's Bordello, and The Killing Fields. All the greatest places that folks on Duris dream about. It is up to you to figure out what type of rift goes where. Oh, and all rifts and gateways are one-way.

The gaping empty sockets of the Dreadlord and Avenger may be sightless, but
its gaze contains something much more searching, disturbing and terrifying
than most mortals may bear. To have the gaze of a Dreadlord or Avenger upon
you is to know true fear. Too petrified to move, your world ceasing and
stopping as you struggle to free and turn away. The ability to gaze is
dependent on the attribute power of the attacker. It is not crucial but
will help subdue the victim.

======================================================
Coming from the Astral Plane, this race of evil humanoids were slaves of
the Illithid race millennia ago. The Githyanki broke away from their former
masters after learning many of their mental powers and became pure evil.
Githyanki HATE their former masters more then anything and will instantly
attack them on site! Giths will go out of their way to hunt down and
kill any Illithid they can find. Githyanki do not have a normal hometown
but must start on the Astral Plane in a Githyanki fortress. As a young
adult, Giths venture to the prime plane and make a name for themselves.
Githyanki look much like humans only slightly taller, thinner, and with
faces that resemble a decomposing corpse. They tend to be ruthless and
significantly smarter than humans.  While their psychic abilities make them
formidable in battle, this class is especially suscepible to the power of
holy Clerics.
One utterance of Holy word can banish Githyanki immediately back to the plane
from whence he came.

As you sail to the  Githzerai Stronghold, AKA ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Githï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and
seeing the blood red seas is a scary sight.  Enough to send
many a fully loaded crew sailing back to friendly waters.  The
 Githzerai guards attack before you approach the unique
and massive adamantite gates. Once you open the gates the dark
corridor seems to go forever in one direction, even though it
visibility turns at the corners of the stronghold.  It would seem
that one even with intense ultravision would have a troubled time
seeing in the darkness of this stronghold.  Low chants and moans
grow louder as the corridors progress throughout the fortress.
The black surroundings of the adamantite are almost mesmerizing,
as there is nothing on the walls. The King is master of is domain
is hidden deep inside his stronghold, like all the potion zones
the leader must be prepared for keys, levers and hidden areas of
the zones.

==================================================
Gnomes are small, sturdy humanoids who are well known
for their quick hands and good humor. Smaller and weaker
than humans, gnomes have more wit to compensate. Gnomes
have colonies of their own, but are commonplace among the
major surface communities. Gnomes and dwarves are
distantly related, and gnomes often understand dwarves
fairly well.
Gnomes have permanent infravision. After the centuries
of experiments and research the Gnomish Schools of
Engineering and Magic have finished their work on another
advancement for their race: ultravision.

Goblin
Goblin - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 20:27:19 by ashyel
===================================================
Goblins are an inhospitable, evil race that prefers to
dwell deep within the depths of the Underdark. They live
in a largely tribal society where the strongest rule
over the rest, existing preferably in underground caves
and similar dismal surroundings. Despite their primitive
habitat they are a rather clever and devious people that
have mastered many of the same skills and magics of the
sun-loving races. Goblins are avid slavers and routinely
capture others to serve at their bidding, especially
gnomes and mountain dwarves whom they hate more than
anything else.
Goblins range in appearance from a dark, dull green to a
dull orange or brick red. It is rumored that Goblins are
distantly related to the Kobolds, but to this day that
claim has yet to be proven.

God call - Last Edited: 2007-09-21 23:07:04 by zion
===================================================
Syntax:         innate god call
The Cleric has the ability to call upon their God to come to their aid. Before specialization, this ability will have one of three effects. After specialization, it will have only one effect.
Zealot:
The zealot will call upon the gods to strengthen him in the ways of combat. For the duration the cleric will gain melee attacks and also receive a boost to his hitroll and damroll.
Holyman:
The blessing of the gods will blanket the room with peace causing all players and npc characters to disengage from combat. It will also clear all
the mobs tracking the cleric.
Healer:
Using the god call as a healer will result in a group buff, that will increase
the healing amount of all healing spells while the buff is active.

Godadvancement
Godadvancement - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
============================================================
As it is with human nature, we all strive to obtain excellence in what
we do.  We have yet to meet a person who does not wish to be top dog,
and this is fine.
On Duris, we encourage you to participate and add to our MUD in some shape
or form. All those who add to it in a significant way will be moved up in
the chain of command. It will not be easy to move up the ladder, though.
Remember, having your god is a privilege, not a right.
If you make a nice zone or add neat features or good code to Duris, you
will be rewarded for your hard work and will move up the ladder. We, the
Forgers of the Realms, wish to encourage everyone to work hard and
contribute to the never-ending growth of our world.
We need your help!
With that said: if you work for us, you WILL be rewarded. On the other
hand, NO ONE will receive a god just because they are friends ith the
bosses or some other such garbage. We do NOT give away free gods or god
levels. Giving these away would undermine the entire principle of
participation and it would be entirely unfair to those who have worked hard
to get where they are. If you don"t get the god of your choice, and want to
be higher, more work is probably the answer.
If, however, you feel you have been cheated, you may request an audience
with an Overlord, where you can voice your concerns and have them heard.
This will hopefully resolve any problems.

Godcheating
Godcheating - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
=========================================================
This is a sensitive issue on any MUD. Cheating degrades the environment and
can do considerable damage to a MUD"s reputation when it occurs.
Thus, on Duris, we have developed a very strict policy toward cheating, and
you MUST understand it. This policy is simple and to the point:
     If you are caught cheating with your god, you will be deleted
     from the MUD. You will lose all of your god powers and there
     will be no questions asked and no second chances.
There are no exceptions. This rulings stands for Forgers as well as all
other gods. Cheating is NOT tolerated here. We have adopted this strict
policy in order to discourage people from cheating in the first place. Just
don"t do it, it"s not worth the consequences if you are caught.
And, as a reminder, Duris has VERY detailed logs. Almost everything you d
as a god is logged: loading objects, dropping things, moving about, almost
everything.
We are not trying to be policemen here, nor Big Brother. Always watching
over your shoulder waiting for you to make the wrong move. Trust is a major
factor that affects all of us gods, and without it, we would never gain any
major accomplishments. The Forgers almost never look at the logs, but they
do, occasionally, when they are bored or receive a complaint. Don"t be
nervous about having your actions recorded; just don"t cheat. If, by
chance, someone witnesses you cheating (as is most often the case), you are
history, period.
If you have even the remotest doubt as to whether your actions would
constitute cheating, DON"T DO IT. Put the situation on hold and consult
with a higher level god.
Thus, the policy is set. You have read it and are expected to abide by it.

Godknowledge
Godknowledge - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
==========================================================
Mortals on any MUD can often get lost or have problems that are far beyond
their control. This generally occurs no matter how well-coded a MUD is.
Thus there WILL be situations where you are the only god around and a
problem will arise. It is your responsibility as a god to know the MUD, its
policies, and its general workings, so that you might be able to help out
when something goes wrong. If you encounter a problem that you feel only a
higher god or Forger can handle, refer the problem up the ladder. There is
nothing wrong with doing that, nor is it a bad thing to do. Actually, if
you are in doubt as to the wisdom of your decision, it is often more
advantageous to do this than make an incorrect ruling.
However, we don"t want a bunch of gods running around who know nothing
about the mud, and who can"t answer simple questions that a mortal might
ask. If you don"t feel knowledgeable enough about things, try to learn so
you will be ready.
Remember, you represent our entire MUD when you talk one-on-one with a
mortal. You are the god, and your actions will reflect heavily upon us all.
One god who m kes a dumb mistake with a wrong person could spell disaster.
Bad publicity on the Internet and in the Usenet newsgroups would be very
damaging, not to mention embarrassing.
So, in synopsis, if there is a problem beyond your control, don"t blow "em
off. Get help.

Godparticipation
Godparticipation - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
==============================================================
This refers to the level to participation each god is expected to
contribute to the MUD. In order to obtain and maintain a god of some power
here on Duris, each god is expected to continually contribute in some
fashion.
The point the Forgers are trying to make is that it is a *privilege* to be
a god here on Duris, not a right. Once you have earned your immortality,
you are an example to all others below you, mortal or immortal, and there
will always be others that, given the chance, would gladly take your
position.
You are expected to contribute to the MUD in some fashion and on a regular
basis. Unlike some MUDs, you cannot create one or two zones, earn a god,
and ride on fame forever. We do NOT, however, mean that you have to work
every day (or even every month), but *some* type of contribution from every
god is necessary to keep Duris expanding and growing.
All gods will be assessed on a regular basis and assessments will be
handled in this manner:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each month, during the Forgers" regular meeting, each god (including
forgers) will be evaluated for the month based on what they have done or
not done to contribute to the MUD. One month of inactivity is fine, even
two, if you are busy, but *not* three. If you have a reason, such as school
or something that inhibits you, fine. If you are having trouble to the
extent that it will drastically affect your MUD contribution, inform the
Forgers *immediately* and there will be no hassles whatsoever.
Bear in mind that gods with months of inactivity (without a plausible
excuse) will be demoted to mortal status. There will always be other people
who wish to work for Duris and help us out. Inactive gods can easily be
replaced.
The god slots are limited. Thus, if you wish to keep your god, you will
have to work for it like the rest of us (including Forgers).
Remember, it is a privilege to be a god here, not a right.

replaces the default "ear-splitting bang" message we are used to seeing. To
get the default back, just type poofin with no argument.
"Poofout" is the same as poofin, except is is the message seen by people in
the room you are leaving when you do a "goto."
To see what your current poofin/-out is, type "poofin ?" or "poofout?"

Godptell - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
======================================================
Syntax:  ptell <player> <text>
This is exactly like tell, except that <text> is broadcast to all gods
with petition toggled on, to let them know that you responded to a
particular petition.
Example:
        Oinkoink petitions "Why is the sky blue?"
You reply:
        ptell oinkoink shut the hell up before I term you!
Which displays to the gods as:
        Petition: <your_name> responds to Oinkoink"s petition with
        "shut the hell up before I term you!"

Group
Group - Last Edited: 2009-08-16 00:52:11 by Kharne
==================================================
Syntax:  group <playername> (to add a member to your group)
         group me (to leave a group)
         group (to see who is currently in your group)
As you gain levels, you will find that a "Group" will be needed to progress
further in Duris. In order to form a group, first you must find other players
to group with. Once you have all gotten together in one place and are ready to
go, a leader must be selected. All players must "Consent" the leader to be part
of the group by typing "consent <leadername>". The leader can now toggle group
membership for each player by typing "group <playername>". In addition, if all
potential group members are consented to and following the group leader, he can
type "group all" to automatically group anyone who is not already grouped. When
a person groups others, he is automatically included in the group as the group
leader.
For example, Fizzwig and Oinkoink wish to form a group with Manwich.
Fizzwig and Oinkoink consent Manwich by typing:
        consent manwich
Manwich accepts the new members into the group by typing:
        group fizzwig
        group oinkoink
If Manwich types "group fizzwig" after Fizzwig has already been accepted into
the group, Fizzwig will be kicked out of the group. If a group member, including
the group leader, types "group me", they will be removed from the group and the
next player down the group list will automatically become the leader. Typing
"group" with no argument will show you a list of people in the group and their
health and movement.
Grouping offers important benefits like the following:
1. When grouped, frags are divided among the grouped players. This allows classes
   that are primarily defensive in nature, cleric for instance, to benefit from
   the frag system.
2. The effect of trophy is averaged amongst group members.  If you are at "boring"
   trophy status, and you group with a friend who has never visited the zone, the
   zone trophy experienced by the group will be the average of your trophy, and
   your friends.  It's a good idea to group with those who haven't done the zone
   your in as it will increase the XP you gain.
3. Experience is not shared when you and your friends kill a monster.  In other words,
   if you kill a monster on your own and receive 1000 xp, you still receive 1000 xp
   if you kill the same monster with five other group members.  However, if there are
   too many people in your group and you exceed the "group cap," you will not
   receive this favourable arrangement.  Note that grouped pets do not add to the
   group cap.
If you find yourself in need of a group, you may implement the "Group Needed" toggle.
There is also a way to split coins within the group.
The social command Beckon is sometimes used by players to request a person to
follow and consent.

Group Stone Skin
Group Stone Skin - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
==============================================================
* Area of effect: <group>
* Aggressive:     No
* Cumulative:     No
* Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster
* Type of spell:  Protection
This spell will changes the skin of the casters group to a stone-like consistency and negates almost all damage from physical attacks. It will last until either the duration expires or a variable number of attacks (of any type, whether they hit or do damage) are made against the victim. The number of attacks it protects against varies with level and proficiency of the caster. If a particularily Damaging attack is made, it will provide no protection at all. Group Stone Skin does not block any damage from magical spells (though these attacks will "chip away" at the protection).

Guild
Guild - Last Edited: 2013-05-07 21:03:09 by drannak
===================================================
A guild is a group of players who have banded together for mutual
communication and support.
==How To Begin A Guild==
The requirements for forming an guild are as follows:
 * All members must be at least 25th level or above.
   The level requirement is simply to ensure that members
   are familiar with Duris and how it's run.
 * Guilds must keep a member count of at least 3 members.
 * Guild names MUST be reasonably thematic and not overly silly or
offensive.
 * It costs 5000 platinum to form a new guild.
To form a guild, find your racewar's guild leader and list:
Goodies - Tharnadia, 1n, 1w from the crier.
Evils   - Khildarak, 2s, 1w from the inn.
==Leaders==
Once the guild is created, the player forming the guild will be
flagged as a guild 'leader'. This will allow them to recruit members
into the guild and promote/demote them accordingly. This is done
completely by the leader and controlled by the code. Any new members will be
automatically be flagged and titled as a member of the guild. This also
will create a guild bank account which is accessible by Leaders and
Deputies.
Once a guild has been started and approved by a god, the guild
members of that guild must run their own activities. How many people
there are of a certain guild rank is entirely up to the players. The gods
themselves will have no interference with the running of the guild
themselves.
==Guild Structure==
Guilds have specific ranks within them which give their members to ability
do different things depending on their rank. How this works is as follows :
Leader -A leader can change the names of all the ranks (this allows an
guild of sorcerers to name the leader as "ArchMage" rather than "Leader".
These titles must be realistic in a fantasy world. A leader also has the
ability to flag a player as an enemy to the guild (leaders are the only
ones that can remove this flag as well). The leader can also add on an
'on parole' flag to members.
Deputy -A deputy (or higher) can delete, promote and demote members and
also has access to withdraw money from the guild's bank account.
Officer -An officer (or higher) has the right to fine lower members
(dealing out punishments etc).
Senior member -A senior member (or higher) has the right to enroll new
members.
Normal member -A Normal member just has general abilities, They can also see
what other guild members are online.
Enemy -The guild leader has the ability to flag a member as an
guild enemy as well. This will cause the guild npc's (if any)
to attack the player on sight and is used for betrayal etc.
Applying for Membership
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to be allowed into a guild the player must first apply
himself as an applicant. You can do this by using the 'society apply
<player>' command where <player> is the enrolling member of the guild
you wish to join.
==Managing an Assocation==

Guildhall - Last Edited: 2020-02-08 03:03:54 by plonus
======================================================
A guildhall is a building that can be built to provide a base of operations for
your guild. All guildhalls start out with the same basic layout, and then you can
purchase upgrades to customize it to your wishes. Guilds can only have one guildhall.
- Guildhalls can only be built on grasslands, hills, or forest squares
- Good-raced guilds must build their guildhall within 30 squares of Tharnadia,
  Charing, or Woodseer
- Evil-raced guilds must build their guildhall within 30 squares of Shady Grove,
  Khildarak, or Llzazan
- Guildhalls must be built at least 3 squares away from other guildhalls
- The Gods reserve the right to move your guildhall if they feel you have placed
  it in a "cheesy" location (in a buggy square, for example)
Guildhalls cost 50,000 platinum and 50 construction points to build.
Guild leaders can build their guildhall via the construct command.

Halflings are remarkably small humanoids that are renowned for being goodhearted
and naive. Customarily rogues by nature, halflings are much weaker than humans,
but possess impressive dexterity, agility, and luck and often have a penchant
towards meticulousness. Unfortunately for other beings who must deal with them,
they also have a tendency toward kleptomania. They also possess keen eyes,
and recover movement quickly if their large hairy feet are not squished into boots.

Hammer mastery is an innate skill among the mountain-dwellers of Duris, the Mountain Dwarves.
The skill is inherited from the thousands of years the mountain dwarves have dwelled inside the
mountains mining and picking away with their hammers. The skill has also been learned by the berserker
as a result of the berserker getting highly satisfied seeing bones and skulls crushed by a hammer or mace.
The very skill itself increases the wielders ability to hit a foe or target greatly with a bludgeoning
weapon.

When you create a character on Duris you have the option of creating it as Hardcore. These characters are enhanced in most areas such as they do increased damage, have greater resistance to damage and have higher hitpoints than non-hardcore characters. Hardcore characters also do not require the epics as others do to move past level 50, they are able to simply exp right up to level 56. However, there are no 'do-overs' with hardcores.  The character will cease to exist completely after only one death.

Harpy
Harpy - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:12:42 by ashyel
==================================================
Harpies were a race of bird people that came from the
jungle climates of Khomani-Khan. They lived in a
matriarchal system, where the females are usually more
powerful and dangerous. They were quite frail in
physical form, but quite adept at the mystical arts.
Nearly a milennia ago, an unknown plague began to wipe
out and purge the Harpies from existence. The remaining
few that survived pledged to teach on the power of the
Ethermancer to their allies before they as well
succumbed to their fate.

==Strength==
Harpies are extremely agile and dexterous creatures with
hearty constitutions.
==Weakness==
Harpies are usually considerably more frail than the average
human, though slightly stronger than elvenkind. Due to their
communion with the forces of wind and cold, Harpies must be
at least resting or even asleep in order to tupor, thereby
making them extremely prone to attack.

When successful, a headbutt will cause a sizable amount of damage to the
enemy with the possibility of knocking them unconscious. If unsuccessful,
the initiator will take a sizable amount of damage himself with the
possibility of knocking himself unconscious.
The success of a headbutt landing largely depends on the mercenary's
dexterity and the size differences, any differences making it harder.
The victim's agility gives them a chance to dodge while their constitution

Healing is best accomplished with the aid of a cleric, shaman, or druid.  Without these essential friends, healing can be accomplished by purchasing an "accelerated healing" from the doctor in tharn for a price of 11 platinum.  Healing is also best accomplished in "regeneration rooms" such as the pile of stones in the Rift Valley jungle, or the Fountain at Vellas.

Heaven - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
====================================================
When you die to another player you will be placed in your respective
heaven. Each side of the racewars has their own heaven. The only way to
leave heaven is by resurrection, or by waiting a specific amount of time.
Depending on how high level you are, that will determine the length of time
your mortal soul binds to a new body. You will only visit your heaven when
you die to another player. Without the limitations of a body your mind is
more attune to magic and you will be able to memorize any spell you are
able to use.

Heroism
Heroism - Last Edited: 2010-09-28 23:39:17 by kitsero
=====================================================
Heroism elevates the amount of adrenaline produced by the chanter
and stimulates the centers of the mind controlling dexterity and balance,
resulting in increased combat abilities. For the follower of the 'Way of
the Snake' this rush of adrenaline also causes them to feint and move in combat,
causing them to more easily fool their opponents into lowering their defenses,
while the Dragon Disciples become immune to fear.
This chant cannot be combined with Diamond Soul.

Hide -Rogue Class Skill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:         hide
"Hide" allows you to cleverly conceal yourself from the occupants of a room,
regardless of whether they are other players or creatures. As with the
"Sneak" command, there is always a chance that you will not hide
successfully and your failure to do so will not be obvious to you. If your
attempt to hide is successful, you can only be detected by "Sense Life",
"Infravision" or "Faerie Fog" . To break the hiding, issue any command. The
effect will wear off after a period of time.
Interestingly, one can use the hide skill while resting.
Certain actions do not break hide:
* glance
* scan
* gcc
* look (limited to looking at room, except for Thief class which can look at other players and mobs)
Other actions will break hide:
* say, gsay
* socials
* casting spells
* engaging in combat
Hide -General Command
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:         hide <object>
Hide is a command you can use to conceal an object within the room. The
object you are trying to hide must be dropped and on the floor of the room
before you can conceal it. When you "look", this item should no longer
appear in the room. You may "search" the room to re-discover the hidden
item.

Hitpoints
Hitpoints - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
=======================================================
Hitpoints, or hp, or h/H in the prompt, are vital to any player of Duris because
it is the amount of life you have. Damage will reduce this amount of life and if
you happen to drop below -2 hitpoints you will slowly bleed to death if someone
doesn't finish you off or bandage/heal you. Hitpoints regenerate slowly, though
they faster when reclining and asleep; also, there are heal rooms and certain
spells can aid in the regeneration process.  Equipment to raise your hitpoints
is available, but there is a limit to how much it will affect you.  Larger races
tend to have higher hitpoints than smaller races due to their racial constition,
the attribute responsible for determining the amount of hitpoints you have.
Equipment that affects your constitution and CON_MAX will raise your hitpoints,
and thus the cap on how much hp equipment you can wear.

However your victims armor class will affect how much you hit also, the higher it is the harder it is to hit. To raise your hitroll you can wear equip with more hitroll, some spells will also raise it. The attribute dexterity will also raise your hitroll, so having good dexterity will help you hit more often.

wall exists has a chance to disbelieve the illusion and pass. One can also
try to search the area around where the exit once was and may find the wall
thus negating the effects.

specific item restrictions.  They have a very small range
of weapons they can use and a small range of armor to
choose from. They have very little restrictions on what
miscellaneous magical items they can use, though.
The illusionist specialization teachers can be found in Ashrumite
or Moregeeth.

Immolure
Immolure - Last Edited: 2008-09-18 15:20:43 by Blaize
=====================================================
To immolure or doomlure is to cause a mob to chase after you
by way of wave-type spells. This tactic is used often when mobs are grouped
together making it foolish and impractical to rush in.
A tank or pet is sent forward first, then the lurer enters, casts, and runs.
A few words of warning, this tactic does not always work the first time.
Problems arise then the tank does not flee soon enough, the pet lasts past
the end of the spell, or the mob shrugged the spell. It is also noteworthy
that mobs able to range their magic have been known to require the lurer
to run farther or turn corners in order to lure properly.

   statistics of items or other private information.
2. Immortals cannot give away objects or equipment, unless mitigating circumstances
   (such as a quest) come into play and are discussed with other immortals.
3. They must not use their immortal to gather information later used on
   their mortal(Any immortal who actively plays the game is limited in commands
   so as not to tempt them).

Imprisonment
Imprisonment - Last Edited: 2007-04-19 19:17:12 by Unknown
==========================================================
* Area of effect: <victim>
* Aggressive:     Yes
* Cumulative:     N/A
* Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster
* Type of spell:  Fear
This powerful spell creates an illusionary wall around the victim. While
the victim is encased in this wall he or she cannot attack anyone nor can
any physical or magical damage befall them. The only way a victim can free
themselves is by trying to move about or by someone trying to attack
them while imprisoned. If the victim issues no commands and nobody tries
to attack them they will be imprisoned for a very long time. It is
important to note that due to the difficult nature of this spell it requires
that both the caster and victim not be physically engaged in combat.
HINT for Victims: If you are caught in this spell your best bet is to just
spam any direction until you are free, other commands work as well so you
can experiment if you like. Once you start trying to break free you will be
out in 2 to 4 rounds of combat in many cases.
HINT for Illusionists: If your having a hard time getting a victim out of
combat so you can cast this spell try using your stunningvisions|Stunning Visions spell,
if you're lucky it will hit and you should have time to imprison your
victim before they engage anyone in combat.

Kenon - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
===================================================
Realizing their mistake with the Kvark language script, the coders modified
it to produce more coherent English.  Though much easier to understand, the
Kenon language script is also not without its flaws.  Due to memory
restrictions, the range of Kenons pronouncements is rather limited.  This
often causes Kenon to repeat itself multiple times like a broken record
because it is incapable of storing more than one response at a time.  Upon
reboot Kenon develops a new grammatically correct response it repeats until
its next reboot weeks later.  With the coders growing skills, and the
ability to learn from the past failures of both the Kvark and Kenon
scripts, the next attempt at an intelligent language script should be
successful.

Kimordril - Last Edited: 2008-03-14 18:53:15 by Blaize
======================================================
Kimordril is the ancient Dwarven Stronghold located in a mountain region near
Evermeet. The town is filled with many Dwarven warriors who are lead by a great
general. The town does not take too kindly to outsiders and most of those who
run the shops are quite racist.  The town does contain all the amenities one
would expect in a modern city, including an inn, bank and shops.

Kvark is a language script created by the MUD with the intention of
destroying the English language as much as possible, occasionally it does
not work properly and gets English right, but more often than not it works
perfectly and generates totally indecipherable bits of gibberish. Often
Kvark gets into the code, while sometimes providing useful features, most
often makes the code un-readable and broken. (:

A leech refers to someone in the group who sits and AFKs the whole time, or someone who does nothing except "steal" the players experience points.  Some leeches are beneficial to the side however, as they play useful characters and just don't want to deal with the tediousness of leveling a new character to 20.  So they join groups or zones and often die, not as frequently as expected though.

Levels in Duris are accomplished by killing or being engaged with mobs.  The progress through
each level can be determined by the 'experience' gained, and there are 9 notches in 'exp' to
get to the next level.  Levels become substantially more difficult to obtain at level 20, which
is why many people are found in groups.  Once a character reaches level 46, they will be required
to touch an epic stone to advance further even if they have enough experience.  After level 50,
only certain stones will allow you to advance.

Lich
Lich - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:29:28 by ashyel

A Lich exists because of its own desires and the use of powerful and arcane
magic. The Lich passes from a state of humanity to a non-living existence
through both force of will, and from employing nearly forgotten and
forbidden forms of necromancy. In life, Liches were ultra powerful
necromancers who, sought to extend their own lives by and means and took
advantage of an unholy opportunity to prolong their lives almost
indefinitely by descending via a transformation from the living to undead.
Appearance:
A Lich can appear as a skeleton at first glance, but they are covered by a
very tight layer of dead and pallid skin.  They are often covered with rotting
but fine garments.  Their eye sockets are black holes with glowing points of
light in the center.

The lizardmen themselves are large in size, and are great experience from anyone 20-30.  Leaving lizardmen is however not as easy as getting in.  To leave the lizardmen you must defeat 2 rooms each containing 2 aggressive guards. (watch out they bodyslam).  It is often wise to have a group of 3 or 4 before attempting the lizardmen.

Locker
Locker - Last Edited: 2008-03-31 17:43:17 by Blaize
===================================================
Syntax:         enter locker <name>
Lockers can be found throughout the hometowns of the various races. Lockers
are personal storage areas where spare equipment that has accumulated can
be placed. There are various levels of locker access.
To access your personal locker, type "enter locker" at any local bank. You
must have enough money on you or in your account to be able to enter your
locker. This price rises as you collect more items.
To enter the locker of another person, they must have granted you access.
You can enter someone else's locker, type "enter locker char_name".
To enter a communal guild locker, you must type "enter locker guild". You
must be a member of the guild to enter! Only one person is allowed in any
locker, including guild lockers, at any one time.
The Storage Locker Safety Commission, a group of other-world agents
summoned by the immortals of this realm, have been called forth to guard
these magical lockers from unauthorized intrusion. They are responsible
for the protection of these lockers -any illegal entry or attempts at
subterfuge will be punished.
Anything you drop in a locker room will be stored and saved as if you were
carrying it on your person and rented. This means items that are transient
will crumble and items flagged no rent will disappear. Anyone who is on
your grant list will be able to access your locker as well. Please see
"help grant" for information on giving others access to your locker!
To help with sorting and finding eq stored in a locker the command "equip
sort" can be used. Typing that while in the locker will show a long list
of options to sort eq by. If the player proceeds to sort eq by one of
those stats it will place all items that have this stat in another chest
inside the locker, 2.chest.
Example:
syntax: equip sort wis_max
This will place all items that have the max_wis stat in 2.chest.

To see what"s inside a container (e.g., a corpse), use the syntax "look IN
<object>." For this type of inspection, it"s best to use the command
"examine."

Lure
Lure - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
==================================================
To lure is to attack one mob and then fall back to a predetermined spot in order to kill. This is useful when there are multiple mobs in the room that protect eachother or in rooms full of aggressive mobs.
In order to do this successfully it is sometimes wise of the lurer to remove their weapons so as to not riposte additional mobs. If this method does not succeed in drawing out the mob then the other option is to lure with spells. This tactic is commonly refered to as the Immolure or Doomlure; though other spells have shown their effectiveness.

mortal powers. This can range from spells with an immensely wide variety
of effects to the uncanny abilities of a particular type of creature to the
curative powers of a potion to the power of song, and even further, into
areas as yet unexplored. Magic permeates the Realms, binding it together,
but few mortals can claim to possess a working knowledge of the Art, let
alone so-called "mastery."

Magic User - Last Edited: 2007-04-20 14:02:09 by Unknown
========================================================
The term "Magic-User" defines a class of individuals who spend their lives
training in the use of arcane magical spellcraft. They are the ones who
stand at the back of a party during battle and hurl powerful offensive
spells at the enemy. Because they are so powerful in their discipline, they
are typically the most frail in stature.
There are subclasses of Magic-User, each with their own specialties:
Sorcerer, Necromancer, Illusionist and Conjurer. Being part of the larger class-group, these classes are affected by the same class restrictions on equipment and are similar in
to-hit rolls and average hit points. There are also some other classes that
only loosely fall within the "Magic-User" definition, these are:
Psionicist and Alchemist. These sub-classes tend to have similar
resistances and susceptibilities to things like spells, paralysis, dragon
breath, etc. Each sub-class rises in level according to its own experience
chart.

Marshall
Marshall - Last Edited: 2014-07-31 02:30:58 by lohrr

Marshall's are those that purge evil from the world and bring nature
back into balance. Falling back to a more civilized approach to matters, the
Marshall is a truly fearsome entity for any evil force. Well versed in the
ways of nature, he extends that knowledge into his combat skills. His skill
in armed combat is unparalleled, and his desire to bring peace and balance to
nature is unwavering; many believe this is what drives those who choose the
path of the Marshall to so strongly adhere to their deepest soulbound beliefs.
The Marshall is also known to have a strong measure of charisma, and can cause
even the mightiest opponents to back away from combat. However, if this does
not work, he can call upon the very forces of nature to empower his allies.

Massrip
Massrip - Last Edited: 2007-04-19 19:17:13 by Unknown
=====================================================
Massrip stands for "Mass R.I.P.", and come in all shapes and sizes, and generally depicts a situation where your group suddenly got bored with life while deep in a zone somewhere. This is why leaving a ''sitter'' is a good idea!
Massrips are generally followed by a long and arduous ''cr'', and is sometimes accompanied by an untimely scouting by the opposite racewar. Massrips can get very ugly.
Some of the more common reasons for a massrip include players going afk without informing the rest of the group, the group leader charging a room full of high-level angry mobs, and of course, bad luck.
Note: Make sure to give the individual who caused your massrip a hearty round of applause. The more difficult the cr, the more flagrant your approval of the situation should be!

Memory
Memory - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
====================================================
Memory refers to the mobs ability to remember a person who has attacked them.  Almost all mobs in Duris have memory, and about half of them will "track" the player through the zone and attack them.  Mobs will definately not track once in the deep big nasty condition, or pretty hurt condition.  To escape a tracking mob, a person may wish to leave the zone (travel to the map), to remain behind locked exists (doors), or remain invisible (assuming the mob has no detections).  Conversely if a mob is tracking you on the map you may wish to hide in a zone.  Certain caster mobs may also track the player by using "dimension door" to pop right into the room of the player.

Mercenary
Mercenary - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 20:56:04 by ashyel
======================================================
Mercenaries are privateers who roam the land in a fashion similar to smugglers and thieves. Mercenaries are a cross between a Rogue and a Warrior and have some of the skills of each. This class is known for its anti-social behavior and tends to be extremely selfish by nature. However, everything has its price and they are soldiers for hire.
Mercenaries typically possess more battle stamina than the waspish Rogues, due to their efforts to improve constitution, but are very agile which allows them to tackle enemies. They are not quite as brawny as Warriors, but like to increase their strength which helps with headbutting during combat.  While a Mercenary also relies on luck, due to long battle experience they are more likely to hit their opponents than either Thieves or Assassins.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   anatomy, sneaky strike, shield combat, two weapon fighting, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control.
==Equipment usage==
Like all classes on Duris, Mercenaries have their own classification of item restriction. They can use quite a variety of weapons but are generally more limited in their selection of armor. They are moderately limited in their usage of miscellaneous magical items such as wands, etc.

Mine
Mine - Last Edited: 2014-10-01 00:03:01 by ashyel
=================================================
Mining is a skill used to remove metal ores or valuable gem stones from the soil.  Mines are spread all over the realms and cannot be harvested without first learning the mining skill and purchasing a mining pick.
Mines eventually run out but your skill and a touch of luck determine how successful you will be with each individual deposit.  Once you've reached a certain level of skill you will gain minesight, which allows you to see mines before landing on them, as indicated by an m symbol
After you have obtained your ores and gems, they can be sold to various shopkeepers throughout the realms or used in crafting and quests.  Return one of each large metal ore to Harmon in the City of Alatorin to receive a special reward!
Warning: Mining causes noise to echo throughout
the area, alerting others close to you on the map to your
general location.

Minotaur
Minotaur - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:34:43 by ashyel
=====================================================
Minotaur are a half bull, half human race, with the torso of a man, and the
head and legs and feet of a bull. Huge horns protrude from the head. Minotaur
are one of the neutral races of Duris, and as such can pick which side of the
race war they will be on at birth.
All Minotaurs start in their hometown, Nax.
Minotaurs can see in both day and night with their amazing eyesight, and they
can withstand a large amount of damage. Be warned though, once a Minotaur sustains
a significant amount of damage, their primal rage will take over, and they will not
be able to control their actions nor channel spells. Despite their bad tempers,
honor and pride are ALL to a Minotaur.
==Weakness==
Minotaurs lose their temper often, being partly bulls, and not quite being able to
ignore that aspect of their nature, whenever a Minotuar loses more then 50% of his
hit points, he will become enraged with bloodlust and attack anything in his path,
friend and foe alike!
Minotaur have hoof-like feet and can wear special types of horseshoes. Also, due to
their huge horns they can not wear anything on their heads. They have been known
however, to wear things on their horns, and sometimes things in their large noses,
or on their tail.

Monk
Monk - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:02:19 by ashyel
=================================================
Monks are practitioners of ancient martial arts which allows them to be lethal adversaries without the burden of cumbersome weaponry. Their hands and feet are deadly weapons in themselves, and monks are trained to use their body in harmony with their minds to destroy their enemies. Monks  are required to be strong and nimble of body as well as very quick witted to successfully practice their art. Monks  spend many years practicing to enhance their agility and dexterity in order to optimize their skills.  In addition to being formidable at hand-to-hand combat, Monks  have also mastered the ability to use certain specialized "chants" in and out of battle. Their chants further enhance the monk's abilities in and out of battle.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   anatomy, shield combat, jin touch, ki strike, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck, and ship damage control
==Equipment usage==
Monks  fall under a unique set of restrictions for equipment. Since monks rely
on using their bodies as their weapons, they cannot afford to have any part of
them weighted down by cumbersome armor or clothing. Therefore anything worn by
monks must be light. However, strong Monks  can wear slightly heavier garments.
Monks  usually favor very light warrior equipment to assist them in combat.

Mountain dwarf
Mountain dwarf - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:44:38 by ashyel
===========================================================
Preferring to dwell in fortresses built into huge mountain ranges,
mountain dwarves are a mining race known for their fine craftsmanship of
weapons and armor. They are good-natured, sturdy, fearsome warriors who
possess, due to extremely dense muscle and bone structure, high endurance.
Stronger and wiser than humans, mountain dwarves tend to live to be
hundreds of years old and often acquire great wisdom with their age. This
accumulation of intense wisdom frequently induces many of this race to
become mentors later in life. Mountain dwarves are born with natural
infravision, which allows them to maneuver quite skillfully in the dark.
They are well respected among most of the other races, and often trade
among the general colonies. Mountain dwarves hold a deep abhorrence for the
races of the Underdark, particularly their evil cousins, the gray dwarves,
more commonly known as Duergar.
Dwarves can complete an in-game quest to become a Berserker.
==Strengths==
Mountain Dwarves and Duergar Dwarves have survived long against magic. Thus,
the dwarves have developed a damage reduction innate towards the most general
magic.

Multi-user dungeon
Multi-user dungeon - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
================================================================
In computer gaming, a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon or Domain or Dimension) is a multi-player computer game that combines elements of role-playing games, hack and slash style computer games and social interaction. Typically running on an internet server, the game is usually text driven, where players read descriptions of rooms, objects, events, other characters, and computer-controlled creatures (Mobs)or non-player characters (NPCs) in a virtual world. Players usually interact with each other and the surroundings by typing commands that resemble a natural language, usually English. MUDs are typically fashioned around the dice rolling rules of the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) series of games.
Duris MUD implements a fantasy world populated by good and evil races with players being able to take on any number of classes in order to gain specific skills or abilities. The object of the game is to gain experience, explore a rich fantasy world, complete quests, and fight in the world-wide racewars.

Multiclass
Multiclass - Last Edited: 2017-11-17 18:25:08 by lohrr
======================================================
Upon reaching level 50 Humans and Orcs have the option of "multi-classing" their character.  Multiclassing adds the traits of a secondary class, creating a new, hybrid class type.
Some pros:
1. You can use the spells and skills of both classes.
2. You can use the equipment of both classes.
3. Your dam modifier is the best of either class.
4. Your combat pulse is the best of the two classes.
5. You can practice epic skills from your second class for a steep price.
6. You no longer lose all your epic skills when you multiclass.
Some cons:
1. You only get your primary (first) class innates.
2. Your mem/prayer times are longer.
3. You might lose some skill level if your second class has a different skill cap.
Considering multiclassing??  Here are some more details you should know:
Players can only multi into classes that are offered by your race. Some combinations are not available. Using the command "multi" on your class will tell you which combinations exist.
Multiclasses get the best possible skill combo of both classes. If the primary class has a skill and the secondary doesn't, the multiclass will max that skill at the primary skill cap.  If the secondary class has the skill, but the primary doesn't,  the cap is 95% of the secondary class's skill.  If they both have the skill, the new class will use the higher between the two.
The spells/skills of the secondary class are ALL moved up 5 levels. This means upon reaching level 51, players will have all the skills and spells of the primary class and the level 46 skills and spells of the secondary class.
Your epic skills will be completely refunded if you choose to multiclass.  Any epics you have spent on epic skills will be refunded, and the money you spent will go into your auction account (auction pickup to retrieve).
Multiclasses can now use items for both classes including artifacts available to each.
The primary attribute for the primary class will carry on over to the secondary class.  For example, if the multiclass order is Conjurer/Shaman, then the primary class attribute of Intelligence will apply to both the arcane and shaman spells. The inverse is also true (Wisdom is the primary attribute for a Shaman/Conjurer multi).
When you multiclass, you lose the specialization you had previously chosen and go back to level 1, with level 1 hitpoints.
If you decide to un-multi, you can pray at the altar in Lost Temple of Tikitzopl.
Here are the options available to each class:
* Warrior     : Mercenary, Cleric
* Ranger      : Warrior, Druid, Rogue, Psionicist
* Paladin     : Warrior
* Anti-Paladin: Warrior
* Cleric      : Druid, Bard, Warrior, Shaman

Mutter is a social command, or an Emote. Typing this command will allow you to Mutter, using preprogrammed commands. The benefits of using these commands will allow you in one word to sum up a long phrase, and social commands are sometimes used as triggers. More often they are a nice simple command to express yourself. The command list is as follows.
Mutter = You mutter something unintelligable.
Mutter me/self = Gee. It really sucks to be you.
Mutter (target name) = You mutter something under your breath about (target name).

Naval Guide - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
=========================================================
Ship Code is another great aspect of the Duris world. It creates the oppurtunity to make great money by sailing cargo around the world and selling products at port to generate personal or guild wealth. It can also be dangerous as enemy gunships may be patrolling looking to cut off your monetary supply and send your ship to the bottom of the ocean. They may also set up naval blockades to prevent you from attacking their guild who may be doing a quest in some of the island areas of Duris.
Here is a basic guide to start you on your way to becoming a mariner in the world of Duris.
Buying Your Ship
If you have the platinum coins and are looking to begin your adventures on the high seas, first go to one of the many dock areas that can be found in Tharn, Good Continent Docks (just north of Tharnadia), Evermeet Docks, Myrabolus, Torrhan, Menden, Jade, Evil Continent Docks, Dalvik sells ships on KK, Stormport and Sarmiz. Walk to the resident shipbuilder and type list. The shipwright will then list the ships available for purchase. The ships generally available are:
Sloop (Baseline ship, room for one person only, high speed, low hitpoints and no room for cargo.)
Yacht (Room for two players, high speed, low hitpoints and an extremely small amount of room for cargo.)
Clipper (Room for 11 players, high speed, low/moderate hitpoints and a small amount of room for cargo.)
Frigate (Room for 13 players, moderate speed, moderate hitpoints and a moderate amount of room for cargo.)
Destroyer (Room for 15 players, moderate speed, moderate hitpoints and a moderate/high amount of room for cargo.)
Galleon (Room for 18 players, slow speed, high hitpoints and a high amount of room for cargo.)
Dreadnaught (Room for 25 players, slow speed, high hitpoints and large amount of room for cargo.)

Necromancer
Necromancer - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 20:56:56 by ashyel
========================================================
Necromancers are the branch of magic-users devoted to spells dealing with
the dead and undead. The spells available to a Necromancer are primarily
offensive in nature and are not granted by a deity. In fact, many of a
Necromancer's spells are viewed as evil by the gods. However, the
Necromancer's dark art can transcend the boundary between life and death,
and harness the energies of those on both sides. Once any necromancer reaches
greater power in his or her studies, he or she can choose to Descend, and
become reborn as one of the mightiest undead entities known in the land of
Duris.
Necromancers do not care about charisma.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   chant mastery, summon familiar, advanced meditation, scribe mastery, silent spell, shield combat, infuse life, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, infuse magical device, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control .
==Equipment usage==
Necromancers have their own classification of item restriction. They have
a small range of weapons that they can wield and a smaller range of armor
to choose from. They can, however, use most magical items.

Neutral point of view
Neutral point of view - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
===================================================================
NPOV (Neutral Point Of View) is a fundamental principle which states that all articles must be written from a neutral point of view, representing views fairly and without bias. This includes reader-facing templates, categories and portals.
==The neutral point of view==
The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views. The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these are fairly presented, but not asserted. All significant points of view are presented, not just the most popular one. It is not asserted that the most popular view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one. Readers are left to form their own opinions.
As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view. It is a point of view that is neutral - that is neither sympathetic nor in opposition to its subject.
Debates are described, represented, and characterized, but not engaged in. Background is provided on who believes what and why, and which view is more popular. Detailed articles might also contain the mutual evaluations of each viewpoint, but studiously refrain from stating which is better. One can think of unbiased writing as the cold, fair, analytical description of debates. When bias towards one particular point of view can be detected the article needs to be fixed.

New Player Guides
New Player Guides - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
===============================================================
Welcome to Duris, Land of Bloodlust! This guide is intended to get new players out
and about with a decent idea of how to use their character. This guide is also not
done, your feedback and ideas are always appreciated in the Duris Forums.
http://duris.game-host.org/viewtopic.php?t=1314
==Settings==
Duris is a very detailed world but sometimes it's just too much, "tog brief" will remove
the room descriptions. These can still be seen by "look room" or "l room" for short.
Typing "display" alone will show a list of options while "display all" will set your
prompt to twoline and in battle will display the tank and enemy and their conditions.
While it is against the training of a Paladin to automatically finish off their victims, for
all others typing "tog vicious" will cause you to strike your opponent as they lay
incapacitated at your feet. This setting will affect to any pets you have or any guards
that might be assisting you.
==Social Interaction==
NChat is a channel reserved for lowbies and Newbie Guides. Typing "nchat" and then
your message will make you heard. Once grouped, to communicate with all those in
your group you can gsay. Typing "gsay" and then your message will make you heard.
Tell is a private way to talk to anyone conscious and visible to you on your side of the
racewar. Typing "tell <playername>" and then your message will make you heard.
==Spells 101==
Typing "spell" will show you your spell list. The lighter spells are available for you to
learn from your guild teacher. Priests do not need to scribe spells. You may scribe
any of your spells into your spellbook from another player's book though if you haven't
attained the spell circle you can't cast them. If you are learning from a teacher you
"hold book" and "hold quill" have a seat and "prac <spellname>". If you're copying
spells into your spellbook from another player grab your book and quill and then
"scribe <spellname>". For casters, each level you gain will award you one spell slot,
some levels more than one. Next memorize or pray the spells you want to cast
"mem/pray <spell name>", and then "meditate
", meditating gives you a chance to
complete your study in half the time. Spells ready, "cast '<spellname>' <target>" or
just cast '<spellname>' for self only spells or to target the engaged.
==Skills 101==
Typing "skills" will show you the skill list. Skills raise automatically until lvl 30 at
which point they will all be at a minimum of 40. Skills attained after level 30 will begin
at 40 as well. Skills may be practiced ad naseum to notch or may be bought for a
hefty price at your teacher. Ye feel yer skill in explaining improving!
==Equipment 101==
Determining the best equipment to wear is not always easy. Everyone benefits from
gear that improves their hitpoints, stats, saving throws, and armor class; however,
different classes have different priorities. A Cleric with 90 wisdom is going to want to
find some +wis eq to reach their prime praying time; whereas, a Sorcerer with 100 int
will search far and wide for something that is max_int, thus increasing his intelligence
over 100 and lowering his memtime further. While Mages and Priests search for hp
gear to raise they low health, Fighters and Rogues are searching for weapons and
armor to raise their battle prowess, items that affect their hitroll and damroll or stats
that are not quite 100.
When purchasing items in a shop it is not possible to determine their stats. Once the
item is in your grasp there are various ways to determine it's potential. Specialized
Bards called Minstrels are able to examine a piece of equipment and determine its
bonuses much like the 5th circle Conjurer spell identify. Alchemists, and all other
Bards, can lore an item to determine the the general stats. At the bank your locker
can be accessed for a small fee relative to how many items you have stored. Once
inside you may also "stat <item>" for 1 plat to see general stats. The auction house
will reveal an items advantages or disadvantages, "auction info <item number>".
There are also ID scrolls for sale (usually for around 4 plat). You may "recite scroll
<item>" to glean the information, though the item must be in your inventory. At times
it might just be easiest to check your attributes, switch equipment, save, and check
your attributes again to determine the best piece of equipment to wear.
==Battle Time==
A wise man knows his opponent before striking. To determine the difference in levels
between you and the mob you can consider killing it by typing "con <victim>". This is
only a level vs level evaluation and does not account for class differences.
==Experience==
Congratulations! You've slaughtered your first stray cat. If done correctly a message
of "You have received your share of experience." should have shown after the kill. This
message will differ later if you keep killing the same mob (see trophy). To check your
progress type "experience" or "exp", see also Exp guide for some tips. New skills and/or spells will become available to
you as you progress in level by killing mobs or completing quests. Certain levels will
award more than just an increase in your hitpoints. At level 20 you will be able to see
the numbers for your stats in "attributes" or "attr". Though some clans may choose
not to make you a member at level 25, you are eligible to become a member of a
player guild or form your own. At level 30 you may choose to specialize your class.
Typing "spec" at anytime will show you the available options.
==World Quests==
World Quests are a recent addition to Duris. The bartenders of Bloodmoon Tavern in
southeastern Tharnadia and Karuna Bar in the upper east district of Woodseer will
sell these quests to any adventurer. For a small fee they will even help you locate the
zone. These quests can then be shared with a small group by the one who purchased
them. The rewards for completing a go kill such'n'such number of so'n'so mobs is a
piece of equipment from that zone at random and experience.

A nog is very similar to a nod, but only slightly.  A nod can
be done slowly and with different connotations depending on
the look in ones eyes.  A nog, however, can only be done one
way and only mean one thing...a big fat affirmative.  If you
are asked a question and you mean yes, feel free to nog at
either another player, mob, yourself or the room in general.
If you understand what a nog is, please do so now.

Outcast tower or OT is a good place to gain some experience.  It has a backdoor just south of the main entry, which can be searched out.  Inside the tower you will need flight or levitation, you can find some of the most amazing creatures.  They range from an alligator nesting grounds to bloodthirsty warbeasts.  On the second level of the tower is all aggressive monsters with decent gear.  Upon reaching the third floor is the most deadly, full of troll guards and a nasty drow sorcerer.  At the top of the tower is a lich illusionist and a nasty energy drain-breathing dragon.  Fun but requires a good group of warriors to tackle.

Ogre - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:41:23 by ashyel
=================================================
Ogres are a race of massive humanoids that are typically
three feet taller and twice as strong as average humans.
Although they are extremely unintelligent and clumsy,
Ogres are fearsome warriors and are feared by all races.
Ogres are evil and ill-tempered creatures, and they tend
to be excessively destructive and have been known to
occasionally eat humans. They live amongst themselves in
clan-fashion and often organize war parties to raid and
pillage.
They have an unparalleled level of stupidity and enhanced
damage versus smaller opponents. The greater the height
difference, the greater the damage modifier.
It should be noted also that because of their bulk,
Ogres are restricted from using arm or leg gear,
and cannot wear full body armor.

Ogreroar is an innate ability unique to the Ogre race which allows him to use fear to weaken his enemies just by roaring loudly at them.
Ogres can affect an enemy's offensive and defensive skills with this skill, but should be careful to time it well, as their throats will need time to recover before they can use it again.

Old Quest
Old Quest - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
=======================================================
General Information.
Currently quests exist on Duris in several different forms.  The first
includes quests that are built into the game.  They may be quests for
information, reward, items, spells, and other various things.  Such
quests have quest mobs in the game.  These are monster who have
information concerning the quest.  In order to obtain the information you
must ask or tell the monster some key word which will trigger a
response.  That response may be followed by more key words, etc.  A
monster or mob may require a specific item which he will reward you for
with information, rewards, or a spell.  The gods on Duris will NOT
reveal information about these mobs.  It is up to you to find them.
The second form of quest is run by the gods themselves.  It is usually a
story that they will tell and groups must be formed to solve it.  The
quests are for FUN.  The sole idea behind doing a quest is NOT a reward.
The gods have taken their own time to create something different and
exciting for the mud.  Be grateful.  Because these quests are run by the
gods, they have the power to do what they desire and that may include
changing the form of the quest.

Orc - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:26:41 by ashyel
================================================
Orcs are a race of evil humanoids that are, typically, five feet
tall with green or yellowish skin and red eyes. Orcs tend to be more
social then most other evil races, preferring to group with as many
of their fellows as possible. Orcs, while preferring the company of other
orcs, are known to also group with Ogres and Trolls, and even Drow, Goblins,
Githyanki, and Duergar from time to time.
Orcs are the only evil race that can multi-class, and enjoy having day-vision.
Additionally, Orcs accumulate experience points faster than all the other
evil races.
Orcs possess unique vision, which allows them to see in both darkness and
light, allowing them to be one of the few races on Duris to travel both the
lands of light and dark.
*Orcs are the only evil race allowed to multi-class.

Order - Last Edited: 2007-04-19 19:17:13 by Unknown
===================================================
Syntax:         order <petname> <command>
                order followers <command>
The "order" command is used in two seperate ways. Classes that have the
ability to charm mobs must "order" the "pet" to do what the player wants.
Example:        order wolf kill duck
To order multiple followers use the command "order followers"
Example:        order followers kill duck
The second type of "order" command is used by players that have purchased
a ship. For more information on how the "order" command applies to ships,

Outcast
Outcast - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
=====================================================
Players are outcasted from hometowns for many reasons. If you are an
outcast in a city it means you will not be "well liked" if you go there.
The guards will hunt you down and kill you. Outcasting is permanent and can
NOT be reversed. Some reasons for being outcasted are:
* Race: Some hometowns are not accepting of other races.
For example: ALL RACES except Grey Elves, Half-Elves and Centaurs are
considered invaders to Charing and will be killed on sight.

Paladin
Paladin - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:02:49 by ashyel
====================================================
Paladins are holy warriors that are dedicated to their gods and to bringing good to the world. They must remain good at all times, otherwise they fall from grace and become a regular warrior.
Although they themselves are hearty fighters, Paladins prefer to rally the forces around them and lead them into battle. As a reward for their virtue and chivalry, they are granted limited clerical powers, which includes the ability to heal.  Agility and dexterity help them best utilize this magical skill.   Paladins also gain hit and damage bonuses with wielding two-handed swords.
Paladins receive a considerable experience bonus for slaying evil race beings, and an immense experience penalty for slaying those of good alignment.
Although they are less skilled than a pure Warrior, they are by far the best horsemen in the world. They have an innate bonus to all saving throws and always detect evil and good. The gods grant Paladins the power to lay hands that heal a target. As the Paladin gains level, the amount of healing increases.
With their innate Paladin auras, they are also able to bestow beneficial effects on everyone in their group.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   anatomy, advanced meditation, devotion, shield combat, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, expert parry, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control
==Equipment usage==
Paladins are permitted to use a wide variety of weapons and armor, ranging from full platemail to massive two-handed swords.
==Disadvantages==
* Paladins are prohibited from "toggling vicious" or setting AGGR on, as this
  goes against all their training and principles.
* Paladins must always have a good alignment.

Parry
Parry - Last Edited: 2013-04-17 21:37:26 by targ
================================================
*Reflexive Skill
This skill is very similar to the dodge skill, but the one performing the
parry deflects the person's incoming attack rather than avoiding it. This is
the first step to performing a riposte.
A successful parry is based on many different factors. Dexterity is an
important variable and racial dexterity is used. What you see when viewing
attributes does not include racial bonuses or penalties.
Among other things, it is harder to parry if you are not standing, under the
influence of gaze, dazzled, blind, fighting a very strong opponent, or stunned.
It is impossible to parry an incoming attack from a whip or flail, and it is
impossible to parry with a whip or flail.
It is harder to parry an attacker's incoming blow if you are focused on
attacking something else.
It is also significantly harder to parry an attack when the attacker's strength
is much greater than your own.
Elite mobiles excel at parrying as do the blademaster and swashbuckler
classes.

Pop
Pop - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
=================================================
''Pop'' is a term used to describe when a zone has been reloaded.
Zones either ''pop'' on a regular timer or require the zone to be devoid of any players for a certain amount of time. There are even a few zones that only pop after a reboot, and will never ''repop'' throughout the duration of the boot.
During zone groups, the word ''pop'' is not one generally used to describe a favorable situation. During the event of a massrip, zones may pop, leaving corpses trapped deep within a zone. A sitter is an invaluable tool in keeping a zone from popping after a massrip.
During exp groups, once all the mobs have been slain, the group leader will usually lead everyone outside the zone, or move to another zone to continue the exp process until the previous zone has ''popped'', at which point the group will return, until all the mobs are once again dead.

A potion is a substance that can be quaffed to give desirable as
well as undesirable affects.  Potions were also once required to
level past level 50, currently one must use epic points to advance
past level 45. These potions were called glowing potions. Many
different types of potions exist from healing, vigorization,
stone skin, haste, flight and invisibility. Potions can sometimes
be further revealed by the spell "reveal true name". Quaffing a
potion is easier to do when not in battle, and quaffing a potion
also has a slight bit of lag accompanied with it.

This spell causes instant death to a victim with less than a certain amount
of lifeforce, with the amount determined by the spellcaster's proficiency.
On victim's with a lot of life force, the spell will fail, and only drain a

The spell is not effective against greater races, such as demons, devils, and
dragons. The invocation fails against the undead, as their are already half-

a very difficult time saving versus instant death.

Practice - Last Edited: 2008-03-14 19:13:12 by Blaize
=====================================================
This is the means to learn new spells or pay a teacher mob to
increase your skill proficiency
Spells:
Syntax: practice (to see a list of spells that may be scribed)
practice <spell> (while holding both a spellbook and quill
and resting)
practice all (this will scribe all spells into the book
currently held by the player if there is enough room left)
Practice is a method of scribing your spells. This is done with
the help of a teacher in the room. For this to be done, you must
have a spellbook and quill in hand and resting comfortably. You
can then "practice <spell>" to add a spell to your spellbook. If
this command is typed without any parameters and you are in the
presence of a teacher it will show your list of spells.
Skills:
Practicing skills can be done by either two options. The first
is passively "notching" skills by using them in or out of battle.
For instance a rogue may wish to practice 'hide' by attempting
to hide over and over. A second way to "notch" skills is by
finding the teacher mobs on the continent maps or in a Hometown,
and practicing skills at them by spending money.
Note: Skills will notch automatically to 40 as you gain levels.

Pray
Pray - Last Edited: 2008-03-02 20:30:33 by Blaize
=================================================
Pray is the command used by certain classes to assign spell slots.  Using the pray command
without argument (simply typing pray) will list the spells prayed for and being prayed for
by the priest and will continue the process of praying for them if the priest is in the
proper position.  To pray for spells, the priest must be sitting, resting, and not in
combat.
Unlike scribing, praying does not require the priest to have spellbooks.  To "unpray" for
a spell use the forget command (using forget without argument will clear the praying
queue).
The pray command is used by Clerics, Paladins, and Anti-Paladins and the speed at which
one prays is based on race and the Wisdom stat.
To accelerate praying for spells, use meditate if the skill is available to your class.

Priest
Priest - Last Edited: 2014-08-01 05:21:17 by lohrr
==================================================
Priests are individuals who choose to spread the faith of their deities
through the use of their god-given spell-like powers. The Priest classes
are generally charged with the vast responsibility of keeping their party
alive with their healing and defensive spells. They are also competent
fighters and can hold their own should battle come their way.
There are subclasses of Priest, each with their own specialties:
clerics, warlocks, druids, shamans and ethermancers. Clerics are the
closest to the common image of a priest: they spread gospel and pray to
their deities. Warlocks are Undeads that are very similar to clerics, but
have a larger repertoire of utilitarian spells. Druids are calmer folk, who
espouse the virtues of closeness and harmony with nature. Though, they can
be fearsome when angered. Shamans are a primitive mixture of Priest and
Magic-User, with some of the abilities of each, but lacking the full powers
of either. Ethermancers use elemental magic and worship the pagan god of
storms. The common Priest grouping means the sub-classes are affected by
the same class-wide restrictions on equipment and are similar in to-hit
rolls and average hit points. Each sub-class has its own experience chart
according to which they gain levels.
NOTE: Use "help <classname>" for information on each of the sub-classes.

Pyrokinetic
Pyrokinetic - Last Edited: 2014-07-31 02:52:59 by lohrr
=======================================================
Upon choosing the path of Pyrokinetic, the psionicist is imbued with the
willpower to manipulate the flame. Under the effect of such pure focus, he
or she can greatly reduce/negate the damage from any fire based attack, or
at higher levels, absorb it completely. Also, due to their superior focus,
they can channel the power of flames directly through their detonates,
making them much more deadly.
The flame mastery skill allows the psionicist to reduce or mitigate cold
damage done upon their fireshield.
Pyrokinetics also get an improved version of Detonate.

Quaff is used to consume a magical potion. Because potions are magical,
they will have no effects if quaffed in a "No Magic" room.  Also, be forewarned! Trying to quaff while in battle may cause you to spill the contents of your bottle instead of consuming them.

Quest
Quest - Last Edited: 2009-08-16 22:29:12 by Blaize
==================================================
Quests are given by mobs to players.  Most often the quest will require the player to get an object or series of objects to bring back.  Prizes can include money, items, keys or nothing at all.  New to Duris is the bartender quest system.
Many bartenders throughout the realms of Duris are now able to assign you tasks,
for a small fee, along with a map, for an even smaller fee. They are either a go
kill quest or a go ask task.  The go kills provide the name of the mob, how many
of them you must kill, and what zone they reside in. The reward for such a quest
is given to you upon returning to the bartender who sold it.  Likewise, a go ask
assignment provides the name of the mob, what they must be asked, and where they
reside, but for this quest the reward is given there and it contains some money.
As you progress in level the quests will become more difficult and farther away.
Potioned players must traverse the planes and sail the seas to reach their goal.
Whichever quest you get will reward you with an item from the zone randomly, and
some noticable experience. The quest may be shared only by the one who purchased
it. That person may share it with four others, upon consent, who aren't too many
levels below them or more than three levels above them. The map is personal, buy
your own. Your quest will wait for your return should you decide to leave Duris.
The bartenders of Duris have spent much time and lots of money to provide quests
and they are more than happy to share them with you, as long as, you make use of
the information.  Therefore they will charge large amounts of money to those who
abandon their quests. All questing bartenders will line their pockets with funds
from your laziness.
Notice you can do 4 quest per level up to lvl 50 then you can do 3 quest per RL day.
ask bartender quest
*Purchases a quest or rewards a go kill quest.
ask bartender map
*Purchases a map of the area surrounding the zone.
ask bartender abandon
*With enough cash this command will terminate your current quest.

Quit - Last Edited: 2015-10-31 21:39:30 by lohrr
================================================
Just like in real life, in the game you cannot just "quit" life. Your
character must find a safe place such as an Inn or setup camp for the night.
There are two commands your character can therefore use to leave the game -
rent (at an Inn only) and camp. If you simply close your client and leave
your character "link dead", it will remain in the game, which is obviously
very dangerous, as it will then leave your character defenseless from
attack.

Your race is defined by the path you choose to take in the Land of Duris.
Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses and your race should be
chosen carefully.
Note: If you are new to Duris, it is recommended that you play a Good race
character, as the other sides are designed toward highly advanced players.
For more information on each race, type "help <racename>."  This will give
you a brief description of each race, its strengths and weaknesses, the
bonus system that applies to it, and its innate abilities, if any. It will also tell

Racewars
Racewars - Last Edited: 2014-08-08 05:29:04 by lohrr
====================================================
Duris consists of a delicately balanced world in which the Good and Evil races battle
one another in the endless pursuit of equipment, frags and more importantly, bragging
rights. To make this possible, player killing (PK) is fully tolerated and is encouraged.
Players must be familiar with the rules of Duris.
In addition, there are neutral races. These races are available to both racewars,  and
players are given the option of selecting which racewar they want to be aligned with.
When a player from either racewar kills the player of another racewar, the player is
rewarded with frags and also the opportunity of gaining equipment from the corpse of the
deceased. The risk, however, is that if you are the one who is killed, you will LOOSE
frags and the equipment on your corpse is now available for looting.
IMPORTANT: The Evil races of Duris are designed to be more difficult to play and
face additional hardships that may be overwhelming for players who are new to the game of
Duris. This includes, but is not limited to, reduced vision on surface, double or more
experience penalty, hometowns and maps filled with aggressive mobs and a lack of protection
by hometown mobs.
This is a VERY brief description of how race wars work on Duris.  The more intricate
details will be revealed as they unfold.  For a detailed list of which races are available to which
sides, look in the help under Races.

Ragelord - Last Edited: 2014-07-31 03:54:10 by lohrr
====================================================
As the name implies, Ragelord's have increased their skills when it comes
to the control of their baser instincts to flurry and rage. With the
enhanced ability to channel these skills, they have learnt to automatically
berserk should they become wounded in battles, increasing their chance to
survive the encounter. Due to this intense focus upon themselves and the
battle, they are able to more easily avoid the more harmful attack affects
of their opponents. They are therefore while still primarily defensive in
nature, able to tune themselves to a more effective offensive captability.

Random Equipment
Random Equipment - Last Edited: 2016-09-25 20:11:47 by lohrr
============================================================
The chaotic nature of Duris manifests itself in the spontaneous creation
of creatures, areas and equipment in places not generally found.
Random Equipment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These items are forged by the swirl of powers inherent upon that moment of
death, and can occasionally be found on the corpses of defeated creatures.
Random Mobs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tossed through the ether from latent world magics gone awry, creatures far
from home can be found wandering lost on the lands. Beware approaching
these bewildered souls, as fear may drive them past all reasoning and
sanity into beings of unrivaled aggression and power.
Random Zones
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Powerful shifts and changes within the earth's crust toss up areas from the
depths. Still half buried, these require a shovel and some hard digging
before they can be accessed and explored to find what treasures and beasts
may lurk hidden and lie within. These places are rare and difficult to find.

Range
Range - Last Edited: 2010-02-07 01:25:20 by zion
================================================
The term range or Lure is broadly used, but it is more specifically used to describe the
action of "pulling" or "luring" a desired monster into the room, that is a room or many away.
Luring or Ranging can be accomplished with spells such as "lightning bolt" or "magic missile"
or flamestrike.  To range something in a room, you  cast <flamestrike> <mob> <east>. Also
certain daggers and weapons can be used "throw <dagger> <mob> <east>" to lure mobs. The mob
and any other mob in the same room as it will all charge in and attack you, so it is wise
to make sure there is only one or two mobs in the room you intend to range from.

===================================================
Rangers are spell casting warriors. They are attuned with nature and are the best
in the world at two-weapon combat. They are so gifted at two weapon combat, that they
receive an innate bonus to their damage and hitroll just for wielding two weapons.
Rangers are almost as skilled in battle as Warriors. Their spells are granted to them
once they progress upward in level and become powerful enough to use the magic as a reward
for their services to the forces of good.
Centaur rangers are not permitted to springleap.
Warning: Rangers are allies of the forces of good. At anytime a ranger loses grace,
they become a regular warrior. The loss of spell casting is permanent.
Rangers are eligible to receive the following epic skills:
   anatomy, shield combat, two weapon fighting, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, expert parry, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck, and ship damage control
==Equipment usage==
Rangers have their own classification of item restriction. They can use almost
all weapons and most types of armor. They are somewhat limited in their use of
miscellaneous magical items.

Ranks
Ranks - Last Edited: 2008-03-17 15:39:17 by Blaize
==================================================
NOTE:  Ranks are currently disabled.
There are two group ranks: front and back.
==Rank Numbers==
At all times, more people will be in the front rank of your group than
in the back rank. The code enforces this for the most part, though there
are times (especially when someone dies or leaves the room) when it won't
immediately be updated.
==Rank Changes==
If you are in the rear rank, leave the room, and come back in, as with a
flee/return combo, you are automatically ranked to the front. Once you kill
one of the front ranked people, one of the rear ranked guys moves forward
(assuming equal numbers in front and back).
==Targeted spells==
Targeted spells can be targeted by anyone on anyone, regardless of which
group rank the caster and target are in.
==Area spells==
Area spells hit ALL ranks in front of you. This means if you are grouped
to the back rank, you will hit your front rank as well as both enemy ranks.
If you are ranked front, you will hit only the enemy group.
==Back Ranked==
People in the rear ranks are much harder to target with physical attacks.
They can be reached via Reach Weapons|reach weapons.
==General Theory==
Clearly a basic group format will have tanks and hitters in the front ranks,
with clerics and other casters in the rear ranks. However, experimentation
with various group formats is critical to success. There is not a single,
one size fits all solution that guarantees a win, you have to be flexible
and above all, you have to use your brain, especially with who the primary
targets will be for both casters as well as hitters.

behind their sorcerer profession, and have instead turned to the powers of
the old gods, studying their ways and natures. As such, they have forgotten
much of their old spells in preference of their new direction, however they
still retain some core spells from their forgotten pasts. In their thirst for
further power, they also too have looked at the ways of warriors to enhance
their abilities and have training their bodies and minds to gain physical
battle skills to enhance their offensive capacity.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   anatomy, advanced meditation, shield combat, two weapon fighting, toughness, improved endurance, fix, encrust, smelt, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control.

The term "reboot" refers to when the game is manually shut down for a short
period of time and restarted. Restarting the game causes all monsters,
areas and equipment to be reloaded as if the game had not been touched. If

in the same location as you were immediately before the reboot. This is
independent of where you last rented.
The term "crash" refers to when the games simply shuts down without warning
due to reasons outside of the gods" control. As in a reboot, all monsters,
areas, and equipment will load after a crash. The main difference between
the two is that you will appear in the game at the last place that you
rented or camped following a crash.
PLAYER CORPSES WILL RE-LOAD FOLLOWING A REBBOT OR CRASH. REIMBURSEMENTS

Revenant
Revenant - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 20:06:22 by ashyel
=====================================================
A revenant is an undead being fueled by its desire to return for revenge
and seeks to wreak terror on those who have wronged it. Few possess the
strength of will and dedication of vengeance required to first fuel their
bodies to reanimate and secondly to survive the compact they must make with
unholy powers to remain on the prime material plane. Those that do find
themselves bereft of most of the knowledge or memories from their past
life, but are incessantly driven to cause havoc and exact revenge upon the
entity that caused them to remain attached to this world.
Revenants retain more strength and stamina from their bodies because their
souls reanimate their former corpses, imbuing them with more hardiness than
most of their undead counterparts. They also possess innate magical
attributes as a result of their unholy compact with the dark forces, but
are not equipped to wield more powerful magical energies as a result of
retaining their mortal flesh.
Statistics:         A revenant seems to take a zombie-like appearance.
                    Upon further examination the self-awareness and fury
                    inherent in their nature manifests itself. Revenants
                    possess much of the constitution and strength from
                    their former lives as well as an imbued mystical
                    regeneration and they often find themselves as the
                    elite fighters of the undead armies that plague the
                    material plane.

==Description==
Adventurers who wander off the trade path from Woodseer will quickly find themselves lost in the Rift Valley Jungle.  Pulsing with life, the jungle is home to many exotic animals, some not so friendly.  Quests are plentiful here, but so are dangers.  Beware a fall into the river, the current is swift!  On the north edge of the jungle can be found the Bullywug village.  South there are rumors of a cavern containing a tribe of Lizardmen.  In the deepest part of the jungle can be found a jodani tree housing the Moonhollow elves.

Riposte
Riposte - Last Edited: 2009-05-02 17:24:07 by Blaize
====================================================
*Reflexive Skill
*Aggressive: Yes
A riposte is a combat maneuver made when you successfully parry your opponent's
attack and manage to score a minor hit of your own in reply. The success of
your riposte depends heavily on the success of your parry.
One of the small hazards of this skill is that it can produce an aggressive
action against a mob that you haven't yet engaged but is attacking you. Such
as a patrol assisting a mob, or a room full of aggressive monsters.
Riposte doesn't work very well against multiple attackers.

A robot is a character that is set up to be run fully independent of its user, through triggers or other methods, by another person.  If you can leave your house for an 8 hour shift and your character is still playable, productive, and fully functional for your teammates to control.. it is a bot. You are botting. The person controlling your bot is now essentially multiplaying.  If we think your character is a bot, you likely already KNOW its a bot, and it will be addressed asap. If you are unsure whether or not you are running a bot, check with an admin BEFORE you get caught with it.

Rogues utilize the art of concealment and deception to gain an advantage over their foes.
They are known to be those you'll find hiding in the shadows, waiting patiently for the perfect time to attack,
rather than jumping into a fight. They are often solitary and tend to spend more time alone than the other classes.
Rogues like to focus their development on strength and dexterity to help master the art of the Backstab
and agility which helps them trip and incapacitate their victims.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   anatomy, sneaky strike, shield combat, two weapon fighting, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control.

==Description==
The Rogue Plains are a barren wasteland found on a
desert island to the north. The plains themselves offer
very little, though they have been an area of conflict
for decades between a camp of barbarian tribesmen known
as the Ebriham and an dark ritual army of undead who
are hellbent on the destruction of the living.
For players the Rogue Plains can be aggressive depending
on which side of the racewar one is on, and usually
intended for high levels. Quests, multizone quests, and
randomload mobs and eq give most players incentive to
visit this area, albiet cautiously.

Rules
Rules - Last Edited: 2024-12-26 14:20:52 by ashyel
==================================================
==RULES==
*1.Creating rules for an online multiplayer MUD is complicated.  It's impossible
for us to devise a comprehensive set of written rules that regulate all possible
in-game events.  In that regard, Duris staff members may use their own discretion
to determine that, in the context of the situation in which the impugned act
occurred, staff intervention or even punishment is warranted.
Our primary goal is to deter and to prevent players from engaging in unreasonable
game conduct against other players or against the MUD itself.  This includes
doing something which contravenes the spirit of our rules -- something
that appears not to break the strictly written word of the rules, yet is still
unbalanced or unfair. In other words: if you do something cheesy,
you will be punished!
Things that deserve punishment include (but are not limited to):
  Gaining epics through dubious means (camping an epic stone, abusing a broken
quest, quaffing epic bottles when they give more epics than they cost to buy, etc),
hacking someone's character, keeping a character rented / camped / voided
somewhere to use as a port target, doing anything that you need a new IP for, etc.
Logging !risk, !frag alts to gain advantage in pvp is cheaty. If we see it you will
lose gear, frags and maybe a level (s).  Be warned this is 100% at our discretion.
Be sure to check help rules often as these rules are subject to change, ignorance
of the rules is not a defense, and it does not amuse the admin. So, do not test our
lack of patience.
*2. Rude players WILL be ignored, silenced and/or punished.
*3. Any attempt to blackmail or otherwise extort an Immortal will be punished.
*4 VPN use is prohibited. Characters linked to VPNs will be treated as offenders regardless of ownership.
==RAID==
*1. Incessant whining, complaining and the use of rude language is not tolerated. This will get you silenced for as long as it takes you to learn your lesson.
*2. You may not log on an opposite side racewar character for ONE hour after logging off.
*3. You may NOT transfer equipment from one racewar side to the other.
As with all rules, the decision to discuss/warn/punish individual infractions will be at the discretion of the admin on duty.  Any questions?? ASK!
==GRIEFING==
*1. Do not be cheesy. Do not make an opposite racewar character from your primary playing side to
exact revenge in any way, shape or form. Keep the fight in its proper sandbox!
*2. PVP is to be expected on this mud, if someone pisses you off, kill them!
==ARTIFACTS==
Excerpt from help artifact:
Players are no longer required to drag artifacts around from character to character. enjoy.
==Equipment Transferring==
Players are NOT permitted to move equipment from the evil side to the good side and
vice versa. This is mentioned TWICE in the rules!

For instance Woodseer is a safer place because it can't be raided by assassins and thugs as easily as Tharnadia can be.  It is often wise to stand on a numerous amount of high level guards while AFK or awaitng a portal to join a group.  The Tharnadian Illusionist is a good of example of where to stand, and the Elite halfling guards in Woodseer are also another example.  Both spots are also portable.

The Savannah of Sorrow is home to many types of rare

a large mountain with a small oasis located in the SW

locations, and rumours of a single, vast pit with a fiery
portal leading to a distant continent have proven
accurate. For players the Savannah can be good mid-level
exp, though the pits themselves can be quite dangerous and
aggressive, especially the final pit which is recommended
for high level players but can reward a number of rare

Save - Last Edited: 2007-04-19 19:17:14 by Unknown

Syntax:         save
The "Save" command allows you to save the current state of your character.
This includes experience points, statistics, money and equipment. If the
game crashes, it resets your character to the statistics and equipment it
had the last time you saved. It is a good idea to manually save your
character often, especially if you have recently leveled, potioned or
fragged. Your character is autosaved periodically by the MUD itself, but
this is a timed event and may not pick up your more recent changes.

Savingthrow
Savingthrow - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
=========================================================
A saving throw is a measure of your ability to withstand certain forms of
attack. Every player in the game, monsters included, has five different
saving throw values. These values are level-dependent. The five different
values are as follows:
        SPE     Save versus Spells.
        PAR     Save versus Paralyzation.
        BRE     Save versus Breath Weapon.
        FEA     Save versus Petrification/Polymorph.
        ROD     Save versus Rod/Staff/Wand.
Each of the saving throws has a value from 0 to 20.  The higher your saving
throw, the worse off you are. But what do the numbers mean?
Let"s say you are in combat with a red dragon and the dragon breathes fire
at you. In this example, let"s say your saving throw vs. breath weapon
(BRE) is 10. A random 20-sided die roll is made when the dragon breathes at
you. If the value of the roll is 11 or above, you have successfully saved
vs. the dragon"s breath, and take only half damage from it. If the roll is
0-10, you have failed your save and will take full damage from the dragon"s
fire. Thus, the lower the saving throw you have, the greater your chances
are for saving against the dragon"s breath.
The same system works for spells. If, for example, a player-killer arrives
and tries to cast a "sleep" spell on you, and you fail your save, you will
be affected and fall asleep. If you save successfully, you will be
unaffected.
Normally, saving throws are determined by the experience your character has
achieved and they will get steadily smaller as you go up in level. There
are, however, items in the game that will lower your saving throws
magically.

Sense life - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
========================================================
Sense life is a spell allowing you to notice the life aura of hidden creatures or players when entering or looking in a room. The spell is a self-spell only for those who are able to cast it but there are numerous pieces of equipment available to obtain the spell yourself. While being in a room with a hidden creature and having sense life as an active spell you will see this message:
You sense a lifeform nearby.
However, creatures without a life aura will be very hard to see, even for a keen eye, thus the message will change if and only if you are able to spot the aura to:
You barely sense a lifeform nearby.

Shaman
Shaman - Last Edited: 2022-10-08 21:07:58 by ashyel
===================================================
Shamans are unlike most other magic-using classes, in that they use the
powers of nature, the elements and the spirit world to create and use their
magics. Unlike Druids, however, they twist the forces of nature for their
own uses instead of communing on a more friendly, integral level. Shamans
spellcasting abilities include healing and offensive, though neither is as
far-reaching or potent as those of a Sorcerer or Cleric. Shamans are also
unique in that they must use totems in order to cast their spells. For more
help, see totems.
The following epic skills are available to this class:
   summon blizzard, summon familiar, shield combat, infuse life, toughness, improved endurance, fix, smelt, totemic mastery, infuse magical device, epic strength, epic power, epic agility, epic intelligence, epic dexterity, epic wisdom, epic constitution, epic charisma, epic luck and ship damage control.
==Equipment usage==
Shamans fall under the Priest classification of item restriction. This means
they are restricted to use of non-edged weapons such as maces, clubs and staves.
Some exceptions are allowed, depending on the deity you worship. They can wear
almost any type of armor, but are mildly restricted in the use of miscellaneous
magical items.

Druids use this innate ability to change their form. Through careful
research, the Druid is capable of reforming its body into any animal of the same size.
To change into an animal, the druid finds a suitable animal, and while
standing alongside it, types "shapechange learn animal" (replacing animal with
the name of the animal.)  While learning this shape the druid must stay in the
room. Once researched the Druid may shape into this form until he forgets it.
The Druid cannot cast while in this form. As well, if the druid becomes engaged
in battle while shape changed, they may revert into their original form.

========================================================
Ship Basic
=========================================
A dock is much like any other shop, you use "buy" and "list" to see what
ships and ship accessories are available at the docks.  You can only buy
a ship at one of the major docks in the world.  An example is Tharnadia on
the Goodie Continent.  To buy your first ship, you must also give it a name.
Names of ship use ANSI commands so you should first use "Testcolor" command
to perfect the name of your ship, otherwise you could end up with a lousy
looking shipname.
The syntax for buying your first ship is "buy hull # <shipname>" where
# is the number of the hull you wish to purchase, and shipname is the
above mentioned name you create using ANSI commands. Use "list hull" to
determine, which hull you want to build and can afford. The smallest and
cheapest ship is sloop. It can not carry weapons but it can transport
a single person from one continent to another.
Ok, now you"ve purchased your ship, the "list" menu at all docks will
have changed.  You can now see 4 various lists.
From now on, you will not have to state a shipname when you change your hull.

Ship Cargo
=========================================
Sailing cargo is the best way to make money on Duris, but it requires
significant investments. First, you need to buy a cargo ship. Amount
of cargo your ship can carry is shown on hulls list. Bigger ships can
carry a lot of cargo, but they are slow, especially when fully loaded.
The good way to start cargoing is to use smaller cargo ships, they dont
carry much, but move faster and you dont risk as much if something goes
_wrong_.
Each cargo crate weight 2 units, thus fully loaded ships will go MUCH
slower than its max speed. This makes you vulnerable to pirates and other
players attack. Of course, you can jettison you cargo and make a run for it,
but it doesnt always work and cargo worth money. So its good idea to equip
your ship with at least some weapons to be able to fight back.
To buy cargo, go to one of the major docks in the world, and dock your
ship there. Then type "list cargo". This gives you a list of the one type
of cargo you can BUY at this dock, and the many other types of cargo you
can SELL here. It also gives you a list of prices, which are vital to
actually MAKING MONEY, which is the sole purpose of running cargo. Make
sure you buy low and sell high. Stand on the dock you've chosen, with your
ship present and type  "buy cargo #" where # is the number of cargo crates
you wish to buy.
Once you buy the cargo, you sail to a DIFFERENT major dock.  Disembark, and
type "sell cargo". You should type "list cargo" to ensure you"re making a
profit first.  Then, repeat, buy, sail somewhere, sell, get rich...
When someone sells cargo at dock, its price there goes down. When someone
buys cargo, the price goes up. Watch out for other players running cargo
and ruining your profit. If you already bought some cargo, but changed your
plans, you can sell it back to local merchants (at lower price, of course).
The further is your destination dock from the place where certain cargo is
produced, the higher it will sell there. You have to choose between shorter
low-profit trips and longer but profitable ones.
Additionally, you may purchase a diplomat's flag for your ship which will discourage
pirates from attacking you but will incur a 10% tax on any cargo you sold.
Note: Each major docks has it's own type of cargo. Therefore, by number of
types of cargo available, you can determine how many major ports there are,
and even approximate what continent any specific type of cargo can be
purchased at.
Example: Elven Wines are bought on the Elven Continent.
Note: If you summon your ship to another location, all cargo in your ship
will be lost. Use summon only as a last resort if you run cargo.
Note: A sloop and a Yacht have very limited space. You can move some cargo
using these ships, but generally its a waste of time.
Note: If you are attacked during cargo run, and you would rather try to escape
than fight back, or you want to be at full speed to fight back you can
type "order jettison cargo" or "order jettison cargo <n crates>" and your
top speed will go up accordingly.
Note: When cargo is jettisoned (or when ship with cargo is sunk), some of it
stays afloat, and you can pick it up using "order salvage". You can see floating
cargo on map. Even warships, that normally dont carry cargo, can pick some
that way.
Note: Some port merchant sell and buy illegal goods, but they only deal with
well-known captains and experienced crews. If your manage to buy such goods,
hide it well on your ship, because they will be confiscated by authorities
if found. The more crates of cargo you have on your ship, the easier is to
hide crates with contraband.

Ship Combat
Ship Combat - Last Edited: 2015-07-09 18:02:30 by lohrr
=======================================================
Ship Combat
=========================================
Combat on the ship system works on the principle of firing arcs,
single target, and damage points.
==Firing Arcs==
Firing arcs are the direction your weapons are pointing on your ship. For
example, a ballistae mounted on your Port(Left) side is pointing to the
ship"s left, so if the target is on the right side, it is out of that
particular weapon"s arc, so if weapons are mounted only on the forward arc,
that means the ship only has a limited arc of fire in the front. If a ship
has weapons on all four parts of the ship it can shoot in any direction.
==Target==
Fighting in ships requires you to lock onto another ship. This uses the
ID of the ship (covered in "help Ship_Looks"). The syntax is "Lock <ID>"
When you are locked onto a ship, your crew will try to attack that ship and
only that ship when you order them to fire weapons or ram. However, you can
reassign the Lock ID at any time, as often and as quickly as you wish.
==Damage==
When a ship is hit, it is hit on one of the four sides. Each side has
two types of HP, armor and hull. Armor is made to take damage, as long as
a ship has armor, its weapons and insides are protected unless enemy scores
a critical hit that penetrates the armor. Once the ship's armor is blasted away
however, damage goes to the hull of the ship. Hull is basically the framework
of the ship, hits in the hull can knock the crew to the ground or damage weapons.
Once all the hull of a side is gone, the ship is taking on water, not enough to
sink it, but enough to immobilize it. Once two hull sides are blown away,
the ship no longer can float and will sink. If the ship is fast enough and
doesn't want to get blown up, they have the choice of running, but be
warned, the rear of a ship has less armor and more delicate structure than
the rest of the ship (Like the Rudder) so the ship will be quite vulnerable there.
Also when a ship gets hit, it has a chance of getting hit in the sails which
makes the ship not able to move as fast (can"t move if your sails have big
holes in it), and even possibly, with enough hits, the sail can get completely
destroyed, making the ship immobile.
==Repairs==
Your crew will try their best to repair damage done to ship during combat, but
they only can do so much outside of dock. When ship is anchored and not engaged in
any actions, it gives crew better chance to do repairs. If ship is immobilized,
crew might patch it enough to start moving again, but they can do it only in
anchored state.
==Weapons aiming==
The chance to hit target ship is determined by the range to target, target's size
and by target's movement relatively to your ship. The catapult-type weapons mostly
affected by distance changing speed, the ballistas and beam-type weapons are mostly
affected by angle speed of the target. Basically, the best situation is when
target is close and moves in the same direction at the same speed as your ship.
==Ramming==
If you ran out of ammo or feel like going banzai, you can try ramming enemy ship.
Syntax is "order ram". This will switch your ship into ramming mode, in which it will
immediately ram the target as soon as it gets into your front arc at distance less
than one. While your crew prepares for ram, their actions are limited. They can still
maneuver the ship, aim and fire weapons, but they arent able to do long work like repairs
or weapon reloading. To stand down from ramming state, do "order ram off".
Your need to maintain some speed to do ramming. Upon ramming, both ships recieve
massive damage, but extent of that damage is affected by ships relative size and relative
movement during the ram. Ramming a clipper with cruiser has devastating effect, but
good luck catching it into ramming position. Ramming a cruiser with clipper is easy but
will cause much more damage to ramming ship that to target. If your ram the target from
behind, it will be weak due to low relative speed. If you ram target head-on, your ship
will recieve a lot of damage also.
The best is to ram ship of close size ortogonally into the side at full speed.
Note: Many players will disembark their own ship after they immobilize
yours or drop its speed below certain point, and then board yours to kill
you AND destroy your ship afterwards. You can also do this yourself
(just don't die on THEIR ship).
Note: After Sinking a ship, use the command "Get Money" to collect the prize
money for sinking your enemy. The prize (frags, epics, money) will be split among
the ships that took part in sinking.
Note: You can get in group with other captains, if both you and group leader are
on the bridge of their undocked ship.
Note: It takes about 75 sec to 2 1/2 minutes for a player's ship to finish sinking.

Ship crews
Ship crews - Last Edited: 2010-12-16 05:00:37 by Jexni
======================================================
Ship Crews
=========================================
In port towns around the world look around the places sailor gather to have fun or settle deals.
You will find whole crews and principal crew members looking for employment.
Typing 'list' in such places will show you available crews, their specialty and experience.
The better crew is, the more demanding it is to their new captain. There are two ways to meet
their requirements. First is to be at least somewhat famous as a captain (to have a certain
amount of ship frags). Second is to be currently employing a crew, that has higher skill in every
area, than basic skill of the crew you want to hire.
The chief members you can hire are leaders of the crew in one of the aspects of ship handling.
Having these guys aboard helps your crew grow faster in experience and perform their duties better.
They will only work for you if you meet their requirements or your current crew is above certain
skill level in their area.
It is rumored that an certain Golem maker has perfected the construction of
Automaton crews, but most believe this to be just a rumor.

Ship list
Ship list - Last Edited: 2014-07-31 23:27:21 by ashyel
======================================================
Ship List
=========================================
This is one of few single commands that will be covered in a helpfile,
simply because this command holds so much information. Using "list" command
at a dock, you can view one of 4 sections:
-Available Hulls
-Weapons
-Equipment
-Cargo
==Hull Upgrades==
This section tells you all the ship classes you can change your
current ship to. A portion of the cost of your current hull will be
deducted from the cost of upgrading to a more expensive hull class.
This means, if you buy a sloop, and then a clipper, it will be more expensive than
simply buying a clipper to start with. However, it will not be as costly
as buying two separate ships (the clipper and the sloop). Again, you will
not need to restate the name of your ship, when you upgrade your hull.
Hulls list looks like this
===================================================================================

* Load capacity is the max weight this hull can carry. It determines how many weapons/equipment/cargo
you can put on your ship and how it will affects its speed.
* Cargo capacity is the maximum amount of cargo this hull can carry (note: each cargo unit's weight is 2)
Ships below Corvette on the list are pure warships, they can not carry any cargo.
* Passenger capacity determines how many players/mobs can fit on board.
* Maximum speed is the speed the ship will go with minimum load (note: some hulls has certain "free" weight
for weapons and cargo, meaning it will go maximum speed with weapons/cargo of that weight)
* Total armor is the sum of ship's armor on all sides
* Weapon slots determine how many weapons you can install on each side of the ship
==Weapons==
Weapons are the fun part of sailing. Shooting down other players and
their ships! Combat will be covered in "Help SHIP_COMBAT." When you buy a
weapon, you must state what part of the ship the weapon should be mounted
on. You should read "Help SHIP_COMBAT" before you buy weapons, so you can
develop your fighting strategy and buy your weapons to match. To buy a
weapon, you type "buy weapon # <location>" where # is the weapon ID number
when you type "list weapons" at the docks, and location is the part of the
ship you wish to place the weapon.

* Weight of weapon determine how much this weapon will affect the speed of your ship. Also, every hull has
certain weight restriction for the weapons put on a single side.
* Range determines the maximum reach for this weapon. Some weapons also can not shoot at targets closer
than certain minimum range. Target-to-weapon range ration heavily affects the chance of successfully
hitting the target. Thus, if weapon has range 4, that not only means that you cant shoot at targets
beyond range 4, you will also have hard time hitting something at range 3.
* Damage range shows how powerful the weapon is. Some weapons shoot scattered ammo, their damage shown as
"N x X-Y" - N fragments hitting for X to Y each.
* Ammo is amount of munitions stored on ship for this weapon.
* Dispersion angle show how far the hitting point on target hull can deviate from the direction you are
shooting from. Dispersion 360 means that target can be hit at any side.
* Normally, you target enemy hull with your weapons, but sometimes you hit their sail instead. "Sail hit"
determines the probability of hitting the sail.
* Some weapons due to nature of their ammo dont do full damage to target's hull or sail.
"Hull dam" and "Sail dam" define how good is weapon in each case.
* Reload time defines how long it will take for your crew to get weapon ready to fire again.
Some weapons have additional requirements to buy or can not be installed on the hull you have. Such weapons
will be dimmed on the list.
==Eqiupment==
There is a list of additional equipment you can install at your ship. Each equipment has its own unique effect.
===============================================
    Name                  Weight  Cost
-----------------------------------------------
 1) Bronze Plated Ram         14  330 platinum
 2) Zentharium Levistone       9  5000 platinum
* Equipping your ship with the ram worth it if ramming is part of your combat tactics. It does additional
damage to target and partially protects your fore side during ramming .
* Levistone is a magical monolith that is able to generate a powerful force of levitation, floating your
ship into air for a short period of time.

Ship looks
Ship looks - Last Edited: 2010-10-05 15:24:39 by kitsero
========================================================
Ship Looks
=========================================
==Look Out==
This command looks outside your ship, at the immediate surroundings. If
you are in a dock zone, it will tell you the available exits much like when
you are walking around normally. This will tell you other ships in your
square, and it will show you a small portion of the worldmap (in squares)
when you are outside.
==Look Tactical==
look tactical (optional parameters are <X> <Y>)
This will show you a tactical map centered on you (or x,y with 50,50
being the center of the map -ie YOU). It is displayed as a hex grid and
any nearby ships will be displayed according to their ID. The Hex grid is
the square setup basically "converted" to a hex grid, so it is not always
perfect in appearance. If the optional parameters <X> and <Y> are given the
map will center on that coord if it is within 35 hexes. This is a
calculated value, if you provide numbers outside the range, you will see an
error message. You cannot Look Tactical inside a dock zone.
==Look cargo==
This will tell you what cargo you currently have on your ship, and the
price you paid for that cargo.
==Look Status/Look Ship==
This will show you a detailed status of your ship with the state of your hull, armor and sails,
weapon status (whether its damaged, reloading or ready to fire) and ammo remaining.
It will also show your speed, heading and target. The ID number on
the upper right corner of the status display is your own current ID.
==Look Weaponspec==
This will show you the specifications of all your weapons. It will show
their weapon ranges and damage each shot will do as well as if the weapon
is destroyed or not.
==Look Sight <weapon number>==
If your have a target this command will show you your percentage to hit
the current locked target with that particular weapon.
==Look Contacts==
This will display a list of all ships within a scan range of your ship.
This is the heart of getting info on your target. The list is broken
into several parts and will look kinda like this:
Contact listing
[AN] "NorgDog"         X:53  Y:50  R:3.0   B:90  H:0   S:0 |SP
"AN" is the ship"s ID this is the parameter you pass to lock to lock onto
this target.
"Norgdog" is the ship"s name.
X:53 and Y:50 are their coords on your tactical map, so if you do a
"look tactical 53 50", it will center the map on Norgdog.
R:3.0 is Range, so in this case, Norgdog is 3 Squares from you.
B:90 is their bearing to you, so in this case, Norgdog is to your east
since 90 is east, so if you were to head east, you would be facing
Norgdog.
H:0 is Norgdog"s heading.. so in this case, Norgdog is facing north
since 0 is North.
S:0 is Norgdog"s speed so in this case, its not moving since it"s 0.
The first letter after separator (S), indicates it is on your starboard firing arc, so if you have
any weapons on your starboard side, they can fire at Norgdog.
The second letter (P) indicates, that Norgdog faces you with its port side, thus
you are likely to hit that side with your weapons (if their dispersion angle
is small).
There can be a third letter at the end of contact line:
blue   'F' - ship is floating in air
yellow 'A' - ship is anchored
red    'S' - ship is sinking
Note: White 'H:' and 'S:' on top of contact list show your own current heading and speed.
Note: when sailing, you should check your contacts as often as possible. This way you notice
any incoming danger early and can react in time.

Ship movement
Ship movement - Last Edited: 2010-10-05 15:22:08 by kitsero
===========================================================
Ship Movement
=========================================
Once you have purchased your ship and sail, you are ready to sail the seas,
pillage ships, run cargo, and travel the world.
==Dock Movement==
When you are docked, you cannot unfurl your sails and take off safely.
You must first maneuver out to the open seas, away from the docks. Some
docks have complex zones, much like a normal zone, except it"s all water.
You still maneuver in "rooms" dictating N,S,E, or W as the direction.
The command to maneuver is: "Order Maneuver <direction>"
==World Movement==
The ship system works on a principle of speed and heading. What this means
is, if you set your ship to a certain speed, it will continue moving until
the speed is set to 0. Heading is the direction that the ship is pointing
and hence will be the direction the ship will be traveling. Heading is
done from a 0-360 degree circle with north being 0, east being 90, south
being 180, and west being 270.
Also affecting the ships is acceleration and turn rate. When a speed is
set, the ship does not immediately jump to that speed, it has to accelerate
to the set speed. Acceleration is faster on smaller ships. On the same note,
when a heading is set, the ship does not immediately face that direction,
it has to turn to indicated direction, this is the turn rate. Turn rate is
also higher on smaller ships than large Dreadnaughts, so theoretically a
small fast Clipper can run circles around a Galleon. Turn rate is also affected
by the speed of the ship, the faster a ship is traveling the faster they turn.
Immobile ship can be still turned by paddling, but turn rate is extremely slow.
==Docking==
In order to re-dock your ship, you must be adjacent to the dock zone, or
adjacent to an area of land which is dockable, and you again use
the "order maneuver <direction>" command as you use when you are leaving
the docks. Not all shores and coasts are dockable You are expected to find
these other locations yourself, however if another ship is already docked there,
this is a good indicator. To test a spot, simply sail alongside the square,
slow to speed 20 or less, and attempt to maneuver onto the shore.
Beware: if you attempt to SAIL into a shore, you have a chance
of CRASHING, even if the zone is a dock. Your ship crew will try to prevent this,
but they cannot be relied upon every time.  You must also be traveling at
speed 20 or less in order to attempt to maneuver.
Note: You CAN NOT re-dock (or summon) your ship, if it is in the middle of
combat!

Shops
Shops - Last Edited: 2018-10-31 00:53:22 by lohrr
=================================================
Shops are places where players may purchase equipment for their adventuring needs or sell extra items and treasures.  Many shops trade
only in specific types of merchandise, or may not have enough money to pay you what your item's true value is.  Thus, a baker or an armorer may refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality!
To some people, murdering the keeper in the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop, or gaining a large amount of experience points may appear tempting, but beware!  Shopkeepers are often rugged,
capable men and women who are roughened by years of trading and surviving in a harsh world.  Killing them may not be as easy as it looks!

Sitter
Sitter - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
====================================================
A sitter is someone who has been given the glamorous role of doing nothing but sitting in a port room of a zone. The sitter helps ensure that if the rest of group dies, e.g. massrips, that the zone will not ''pop'', and that the group members can quickly port up to the sitter, ensuring a much more expedient ''cr''.
As a sitter, it is important not to fall asleep or go watch a movie, thus letting your character idle out, leaving your group without a sitter.
Sitters also serve an additional role, acting as an early warning system for enemy groups. Sitters are usually the first to die in zone hits, but will alert the group to prepare for combat. After being alerted of an enemy presence, the group's chances of survival are greatly increased.

Smoke
Smoke - Last Edited: 2016-12-26 12:33:02 by lohrr
=================================================
Syntax:  smoke <herb> <pipe>
  Smoke is used to inhale burning herbs and accrue their benefits.  Because the
herbs are magical, they will have no effects if smoked in a "No Magic" room.
  In order to smoke, you must be holding a pipe in one of your hands and must
have the herb in your inventory.  Herbs are notoriously fickle to heat and
humidity, whilst pipes come in a variety of styles and strengths.  The cheaper
the pipe the quicker it will fail under the pressures of applied heat.
  Smoking is also subject to the weather and various terrains.  Also, certain
races have physical or social reactions to smoking.  Trolls notoriously have
great difficulties in smoking, although it is possible for them under the
proper conditions.
Please Note:
Smoking aggravates the lungs which will cause you to experience a waiting period
before you can smoke again.  This wait time varies from herb to herb.

The mysterious Solbeep created a spell that allows the caster to

which can cause great damage if they hit their target soundly.
Rumor has it that when the caster is suitably advanced, he will learn
how to throw more missiles.

=====================================================
Sorcerers are spellcasters who have devoted their lives to the pursuit of great and powerful magic. The spells at their command are primarily offensive and are not granted through the worship of any deity, but are rather trained and memorized using the Sorcerer's intelligence.
Sorcerers are physically weak by most standards, and can be quite frail, requiring them to focus training on constitution. Their abilities at hand-to-hand combat leave much to be desired,and, in most cases, they leave the fighting arts to fighters. To make up for these handicaps, Sorcerers have created some of the deadliest spells in the world, many of which can kill with a single blow. Improved strength gives sorcerers a boost in spell damage as well.
The following epic skills are available to this class:

* Area of effect: <victim>
* Aggressive:     Yes
* Cumulative:     No
* Duration:       Instantaneous
* Type of spell:  Spiritual
"Soul Disturbance" causes the victim's soul to be wracked with pain, doing
considerable damage to unguarded souls. But if the victim has no soul, the
spell does nothing. Souls that have a ward reduce the spell's damage.
Soul disturbance is more difficult to shrug than other spells, but not
impossible. The spell can still be shrugged.

Spank is a social command, or an Emote. Typing this command will allow you to Spank someones bottom, using preprogrammed commands. The benefits of using these commands will allow you in one word to sum up a long phrase, and social commands are sometimes used as triggers. More often they are a nice simple command to express yourself. The command list is as follows.
Spank = Interesting thought, but it needs to be directed somewhere.
Spank me/self = You start slapping your rear end, giggling.
Spank (target name) = You turn (target name)  on your knee and spank him

Specialization
Specialization - Last Edited: 2013-04-17 17:31:38 by targ
=========================================================
Upon reaching level 30, you may "specialize" you character, meaning to
choose a path or skill-set. After you have decided what specialization you
would like to be, you must find the proper "teacher" mob of your class to
aid you in your specialization. Then, you must type "spec " to confirm
your choice.
Specializations are a subset of classes that a player can choose. The
only ones who can specialize players are a set of wandering mobs across
the maps of the good and evil continent. Each class has some assigned
teachers with which they can specialize; for example, Warriors can find the
dwarven warrior Surak to specialize and Sorcerers can find the wandering
mage Ghiran to specialize. Upon specializing a player might be granted
extra innate abilites, casting spells, or skills.
There are also widespread rumors that the instructors at The Torrhan
School of Knowledge have learned to instruct others in the
intricacies of specialization.

In the world of Duris spells are the fundemental tool of all magic-using classes.  While the casting systems, requirements, and spells available vary greatly by race and class, it is on the spell level that magic enters the world of Duris.  Many help files are available detailing spell types, systems, and syntax.  Cast is the best place to start.

Spell circle
Spell circle - Last Edited: 2008-03-28 18:25:42 by Blaize
=========================================================
Just as in AD&D, Duris has placed its spells in various levels called
circles. As a caster gains in level, he learns more of the magical arts and
has a larger repertoire of spells to choose fro . These new spells exist in
"Circles". At any given level, a caster can draw from a specified number of
circles and can memorize/pray/tupor/assimilate/commune for a certain number
of spells in each circle which fit into "Spell Slots". As a caster's level
increases he learns more magic and can draw from more circles as well as
regenerate more spells from each circle. The circles are gained as follows:
Level 1  -1st Circle
Level 6  -2nd Circle
Level 11 -3rd Circle
Level 16 -4th Circle
Level 21 -5th Circle
Level 26 -6th Circle
Level 31 -7th Circle
Level 36 -8th Circle
Level 41 -9th Circle
Level 46 -10th Circle
Level 51 -11th Circle
Level 56 -12th Circle
See the specific help files on each class to find out which spells belong
to each circle for any given class. There is a slight chance of spell
failure for the last circle learned.

Spell Failure
Spell Failure - Last Edited: 2007-04-22 22:12:53 by Unknown
===========================================================
A caster who has practiced specific spells for a long period of time
becomes very skilled at casting the spells. He is able to work his magic
without fear of error or incorrectly invoking magic. So, as he gains in
levels, the lower spells become second nature to him. However, when he is
charged with learning new spells of a more complicated nature than he is
used to, he may find it difficult to cast without error. So, casters will
find that they sometimes cannot cast a spell of their highest circle every
time they try. Expect spell failure as you are learning the spells and are
not yet a master of their powers.

Spell Slot
Spell Slot - Last Edited: 2007-04-20 14:02:09 by Unknown
========================================================
A caster is able to hold a certain number of spells in each spell circle,
dependent on level. Each spell occupies one spell slot in the given circle.
Casters that commune, assimilate or tupor cannot choose what spells will
fill their specific slots, unlike casters that memorize and pray.

Spell System
Spell System - Last Edited: 2007-04-20 14:02:09 by Unknown
==========================================================
Duris, in its attempt to improve on the standard, stock DikuMUDs that
already exist throughout the Internet, has moved away from the traditional
mana system. In its place, the Duris Forgers have implemented a system very
similar to that used in the AD&D game. Rather than a pool of mana from
which any spell can be drawn, most casters on Duris must memorize/pray/commune/assimilate or tupor spells. These spells are divided into different "Spell
Circles" limiting the spells that a caster/semi-caster can draw upon. At
level 1, a caster is proficient in one spell circle and is allotted one
"Spell Slot" from that circle which he can regain via one of the methods
listed above. As he gains in levels, the numbers of Spell Slot|slots available in each
circle increases as does the number of Spell Circle|circles in which the caster is
proficient. The caster has available to him a number of spells at each
circle which he can regenerate. He simply chooses those spells which he
wishes to use then must fill his reservoir in one of the mentioned ways.
The slots can be used up on all different spells or all on the same spell or
any combination of spells. These spells are then a part of the caster"s mind
and can be called upon at any time. Once a spell is cast it is no longer
memorized or prayed for. It becomes a spell that needs to be memorized again.
It cannot be cast again until it is re-memorized or re-prayed for.
