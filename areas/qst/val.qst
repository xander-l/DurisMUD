hi king quest~
The king grunts.

&+WThe king tells you 'Salutations, as you can see I have alot on my mind.
&+WPerhaps ...you can be of some use to me.

He nods.

&+W'You see ...the three leading families within my kingdom reside just outside
&+Wmy castle, and there have been rumors amassing that they plot against me.
&+WHowever, since they're influence is felt nearly everywhere in the world, it
&+Wwould do me more harm than good to openly oppose them...

&+WIf they were to meet some untimely demise, I'm sure I'd be grateful.'

Q
Thanks indeed, maybe now I can rule my kingdom effectively.
