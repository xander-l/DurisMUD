  1/07/96 - Right now, DikuEdit will load the world file (.WLD) only, reading
            in all the info for each room more or less correctly.  Room flags
            are displayed, as are room descriptions and exits (duh).  The rooms
            are fully constructed as they should be, with links intact, etc.
            etc.

            Extra descriptions are not quite read correctly, however..  If
            there are more than one in a room, they are linked correctly, but
            right now the parser isn't smart enough to break the keyword
            list into separate words..  This means that if an extra description
            has more than one keyword, you have to type them all out..  This
            will be fixed soon, honest.

  1/09/96 - Broke the source up into several source files so as to make it more
            readable and modular and all that good stuff.

            The sector type is now displayed along with the room flags.

  1/13/95 - Quite a bit more modularization and fix-ups...  Extra description
            keywords now almost work..  And some other minor things too.

            Woohoo, extra description stuff now works perfectly.

            Still more modularization...  Made a separate function
            displayColorString, instead of having all the color interp stuff
            in displayStringNodes..  Similar stuff done all round..

  1/14/95 - Yet more modularization - slapped the code that reads room exits
            into its very own function...  The exit keywords are now properly
            generated, as well.

            Oh yeah, expanded the room info command quite a bit yesterday
            as well...  It now actually contains useful info.  Scary eh.

  1/19/95 - Hoo boy, quite a bit of change between now and then.  Too much to
            list, really.  Basically, objects are now loaded correctly, and
            reading a list of string nodes is now more efficient thanks to
            a whole new function dedicated to doing just that.  Enjoy.

  1/20/95 - Mobs are now loaded as well..  All that's left is the zone file
            itself, and we in da money.

            The zone file is now loaded, although none of the commands are
            executed as of yet..  Also, the files are now closed after reading
            them, conserving handles and a bit o memory..

            Mobs and objects are now loaded into rooms as they should be and
            are displayed properly to boot.  Not much left now..

  1/25/95 - Between now and then, objects now show descriptions properly..
            Mobs are next, blah blah blah..  Mobs now show descriptions
            properly, and users are notified if they try to look at an object
            w/o a description.  Not much left before the writeFile functions
            come in and then the editing functions can begin, baby.

            Oh yeah, objects are put in objects properly..  Well, I think
            so, anyway.

  1/26/95 - You can now see the objects inside containers by looking at
            them.  Same is soon to come for equipment on mobs and stuff just
            being carried by mobs.

            Made things a bit more efficient in the powerful look function.

            Equipment is now loaded into mobs properly.  Looking at a mob
            reveals what is equipped, although the slot is not shown and there
            is no slot-checking when loading the equipment onto the mob
            (beyond making sure the number for the slot is not too high).
            This will be fixed soon, of course..

  1/27/95 - You can now see equipment equipped by mobs as well as see what
            objects they are carrying.

            There seems to be a bug with keyword matching with objects and
            stuff inside of objects...  It will be fixed soon.

  1/28/95 - Fixed some bugs with keyword matching of objects and mobs, etc,
            it's all better now.

  1/30/95 - The world file is now written when typing 'SAVE'..  It mostly
            works, but alas, the keyword string isn't being built properly
            for some odd reason..  It will be fixed soon, honest.

            The error was only with exits, which don't always have keyword
            lists.  There's a buglet in createKeywordList someplace, it's
            been sorta kludged around (sorta, but not really).  Perhaps
            someday I will look for and destroy the pesky bugger..  Or,
            maybe not.  ;)

            All the room info is now recognized...  Fall percentage etc.

  2/04/96 - Quite a few changes...  The world file is now saved correctly,
            a few efficiency changes involving the overuse of strlen(), the
            getStrn() function now basically works as planned with but a few
            minor changes and bugfixes to go..  And some other stuff.

  2/06/96 - The object file and mob file are now saved correctly, all that's
            left in the zone file are the mob, etc. loading commands.

            You can now look inside objects.  Looking at mobs shows info on
            their level, alignment, and class.

            Door flags (closed, locked, etc) are now shown next to the
            corresponding exits.

            Made the "look at exit" code more modular and efficient.

            Various other things related to the above stuff..

  2/07/96 - The exit info is now saved properly, along with some nifty comments
            about where the exit leads to and is from and what state it sets
            the door..  Great eh.

  2/08/96 - The zone file is now written in its entirety, along with lots of
            nice little comments.  All that's left now is to add the editing
            functions, and ...  that's it.

            The master keyword list creator now creates entries for mobs as
            well as objects and room extra descs.  The function that scans
            the master keyword list for a specific keyword also now returns
            the matching master keyword list node, too.  Kinda handy.

  2/09/96 - checkMasterKeywordList now recognizes the wonderful "number dot"
            notation for 1-9.  (i.e. "look 3.kobold" to look at the 3rd
            kobold, etc).

  2/10/96 - createMasterKeywordList now makes nodes for objects w/o any extra
            descs - the extraDescPtr thingy is simply set to NULL.  Thus, life
            has become much more simple.

            Tidied up the lookStuff command quite a bit.  Now it's super.

  2/12/96 - The number of each object and mob type loaded is now kept track of
            and written into the zone file properly (no more limits of 999).

            Oh yeah, and I may need to create a file "blah.INF" or something
            similar that contains extra info such as which objects to set to
            an "unlimited" limit (999 works) etc.

  2/14/96 - Started work on the "edit room" command yesterdayish.

            Fixed bug in displayColorString function...  tis all better now.

  2/17/96 - Everything in a room is now editable except for extra descs, and
            that will be easy to add.

            Added a few more utilitarian functions, split shit up a bit more..
            Woohoo!

  2/21/96 - Extra descs are now semi-editable.

            The g_madeChanges variable is now set based on whether or not you
            (gasp) changed a room record with the powerful "edit" command.
            It even works 100% correctly.  Huzzah.

  2/22/96 - Extra descs for rooms are fully editable, but alas, new ones can
            not yet be created.

  2/23/96 - More fixes with extra descs - aborting now actually restores the
            old extraDesc..

            Made deleteRoomInfo() so it actually delivered on its promise,
            fixed up a few other minor bugs that weren't resetting room
            properly..

  2/27/96 - Fixed all the stuff with aborting editing a new room etc etc...
            blehh

  2/28/96 - Fixed it up for good, mostly..  Sorta.  Kinda.  Uhh, what else.
            Stuck source in subdirectories for enhanced organization.  Woo.

            Minor fixes here and there..

            A "default" room is now created if you choose a "main" name that
            doesn't exist.  Great gravy.

            Extra descs are now set up properly when aborting, etc. etc..  It
            all works like a charm.

   3/1/96 - The writeWorld etc functions all report how many are being
            written, now.

            Made writeFiles() function.

            The bit that creates a default room is now more "correct"..

            Creating extra descs now actually WORKS.

   3/2/96 - Editing an extra desc and then quitting back doesn't do wacky
            shit any more.

            Added the "list rooms" command.

            I believe on 3/1/96, added nice little bracketed indicators for
            mob position (sitting, standing, etc).

            Exits can now be edited, although only the keyword list can be
            edited at the moment.

   3/4/96 - The description of exits can now be edited as well.  Woohoo!

            Split up the EDITROOM.C file into logical little subfiles and
            stuck the subfiles that I'm finished writing in the room/ subdir.

            Aborting editing room exits now restores them properly.

            Added the "list objects" command (lists object types).

            Added the "list mobs" command (lists mob types).

   3/5/96 - Added a function that truncates a string if it's over a certain
            length, adding " .. " to the end.  Handy for menus where if the
            title is too long things get messy.

            The writeFiles() function now sets g_madeChanges to FALSE.  Doh.

            All room names are now "fixed" with fixRoomName so that they
            don't make menu titles too long.

            Wacky errors with fgets() not reading enough or too much...  Fixed,
            I think.  Too bad fgets() has to suck.

            When reading a zone file, DikuEdit now keeps track of which line
            it's on (I think it's right..).  Handy when you've got silly
            fgets() errors.

            Exit "door flags" are now editable, though it doesn't make
            DikuMud any less wacky..

            When editing the room sector type, the current sector type is
            indicated by a nice little box next to the corresponding type,
            just like for room flags, exit flags, etc.  (Previously the
            prompt would change, and man, was that ugly.)

            Still more reorganization into subdirectories.

            Changing an exit flag no longer redraws the entire menu.

            The exit "door state" is now editable.

            Contrary to what I first thought, I think the "door flag" is more
            like the "door type" - it can't be set beyond 0, 1, 2, or 3 - no
            bitwise stuff.

            Thusly, when the door type is set to 0 (no door), you are not
            allowed to set the door state to something other than 0 (open).
            Conversely, if the door state is set to something other than
            0, you cannot set the door type to 0.  The zone file reading
            function now checks to make sure that an exit set to 0 does not
            have a door state besides 8 (blocked, which for some reason is
            apparently always set on exits set to "no door"..  time to talk
            to some area gods, I think).

            Exit key numbers and destination rooms are now fully editable,
            making exits fully editable.

            DikuEdit now checks to see if any key object numbers are invalid
            (that is, the info for the obj numb specified is not in the .OBJ)
            and warns the user during loading of files - perhaps take this out
            or make it disableable (heh) through the command-line or sump'n.

   3/6/96 - You can now edit exits directly from the command-line by typing
            "EDIT NORTH" or "ED N" or any combination thereof.

            The main prompt now has a full command history not unlike
            DOSKEY.  It's handy.

            Added the "GOTO" command, which takes a command-line parameter
            or displays a prompt if you don't specify one.  This command
            causes you to jump on over to the room number specified.

            You can now create exits.

            Added the "SWAPEXITS" command, which allows you to swap two exits
            (including a valid east exit to a blank south one or vice versa).

            strnSect() modified so that if end is greater or equal to len, it
            is set to len - 1 instead of having the function return a NULL
            string.

   3/9/96 - More reorganization of source files..

  3/10/96 - Changed the createRoomExit() function so that if there are no
            exit slots available, the user is informed..  Woo.

  3/11/96 - Rooms can now be created.

            Exits are now deleteable.

            A few touchups to source here and there..

            Exits are now deleteable and createable from the command-line.

            Typing the "EDITEXIT" command by itself now shows a list of exits
            in the room as per the list shown in the "EDITROOM" command.

            Fixed a little bug where, when using the editRoomExits() function,
            editing an exit, saving the changes for that exit, but then
            aborting the changes for ALL exits for that room, g_madeChanges was
            set to TRUE.  Good thing, eh?

  3/13/96 - Room extra descs are now editable from the command line.

  3/18/96 - Uhh...  Rooms can now be deleted.  That's about it as far as
            noticable stuff for right now.

            Added the renumberRooms() function - eliminates gaps in room
            numbers.

            Blank strings are no longer added to the history list.  Handy.

            You can now delete rooms by specifying the number on the command-
            line.

            Rooms are now automatically renumbered when saving the zone file.

            You can delete all exits pointing to a deleted room as well as
            reset them to -1.  Very handy, methinks.

  3/19/96 - Extra descs are now deleteable from the "edit room" menu - yeeha.

            Fixed up a few bugs with setting Last pointers, etc. in extraDesc
            records.

            A few other changes made sometime or another involving the room
            info command being a bit more accurate, the goto command being
            a bit more accurate, and minor internal changes..

            If you tried to edit an exit that didn't exist, DE would happily
            let you and then crash as soon as you tried to edit anything.
            Fixed..

  3/20/96 - Fixed a small bug with the editEntity() function.  Tis all better
            now.

  3/21/96 - Room description is now editable from the command-line.

  3/22/96 - Object types are now semi-editable.  It's zany.

  3/25/96 - Hitting Escape at the prompt now erases the text contained therein
            instead of doing zany shit.

            Added the clrline() function - handy.

            Working on the getStrn function so it will work with wide fields -
            it semi-kinda-not-really-works now.

   4/6/96 - Got most of the kinks worked out of the getStrn function, methinks.

   4/7/96 - Yeeha, it's perfect I tell ya.

            Fixed a little bug with changing room sector types from one column
            to another.  Life is gooooooooood.

            Object keywords and extra bits are now editable.  Also, an object
            can be picked in the same way that rooms can be gone to with the
            GOTO command..

            Objects are now more editable, well, sorta.

   4/8/96 - Object extra descs are fully editable.

            Other stuff.

   4/9/96 - All the object editing menus are now displayed, though many
            options are still not editable.  This will soon be fixed..

  4/11/96 - Object type is now editable, and you can even see a list of all
            the available types along with their corresponding numbers.  Also,
            all the various "types" now have a nice descriptive string
            displayed (liquids, instruments, spells, etc)

  4/12/96 - Objects are fully editable except for weight, value, and rent cost.

            I lied.  Object types are fully editable.  Yohoho.

  4/14/96 - objectHere records in rooms are now properly updated when obj types
            are renumbered.

            When creating a new objHere in a room, the number of entities
            loaded (a bit of a misnomer, but hey) is incremented so that the
            zone file is saved and thus loaded properly.

            Err, ohh yeah, objects can now be placed in rooms.

  4/16/96 - Trying out new keys for flags...  Making quit and abort keys ^Q and
            ^X so that Q and X are free for flag toggling, seems a bit awkward.
            What to do, what to do.

  4/17/96 - Between now and yesterday, changed all the flags menus so that ^Q
            and ^X are used instead of Q and X, and ^F can be used to edit the
            flags value directly.  Talk about handy.

  4/18/96 - ^D is now used for direct values, ^F turns all bits off, ^N turns
            them all on, ^T toggles them.  Created a commonFlags function
            thingy to make these easier to add.

            Objects in rooms can now be deleted with ease.

            Object types are now deletable.  And, as extra bonus, I whip code
            into shape.  Now, objectHeres of the type deleted are also deleted,
            as per the user's request.

  4/19/96 - Added the "list objectHere" command - currently only lists objects
            lying about in rooms, may add support for objects in other objects
            and mobs later.

            All the miscellaneous stuff for rooms is now editable (fall chance,
            mana apply flag, min and max level).

            Updated object and mob flags based on info from Duris.

  4/20/96 - Between now and yesterday...  Hmm.

            Updated the editEntity() function so that almost everything is
            editable by keyword now..

            Looking at exits shows the key number and name, or if the type is
            -2, the magic word to open it.

            You can now get context-sensitive "help" when editing obj values.
            (Hitting "?" for the "weapon type" field lists weapon types, etc).

            Other stuff.  I forget.

            Background colors and flashing text are now recognized.  Also,
            displaying "&<invalid char>" now displays both characters instead
            of cutting out the ampersand.  Wooha.

            Mobs are now editable - only name and keywords right now, but more
            to come later.

            Mobs can now be placed in rooms.

            Mobs can now be deleted from rooms.

            Fixed some bugs with editable and master lists not being updated
            properly when creating and deleting stuff in rooms.

  4/21/96 - Mob miscellaneous stuff can all be edited except for money, pos,
            default pos, and sex, soon to be added.

            Mob types are now createable.

            Added whitespace here and there..  Woohoo.

            Fixed a couple of bugs with reading room extra stuff - (fall %age,
            etc) - first, linefeeds weren't being read..  Second, all had to
            be stored in longs, lest the silly scanf function try to fill the
            1-byte characters with 4 bytes of crap..  Bah.

  4/22/96 - Mobs are now fully editable.

            Made functions that delete objHeres of various types, check for
            objHeres of types that need to be deleted, etc. instead of sticking
            it all in one specialized function.

            Any objectHere nodes of an object type being deleted are now
            deleted properly.  There may be some memory leaks with deleting
            a container object full of objects, but the leak is small, and
            it disappears when the editor is reloaded, of course..

  4/23/96 - Room numbers that are out of order are picked up while loading,
            though for some reason the editor always sez a room with the
            number 0 is out of order.  Not sure why, but it don't really
            matter.

            Duplicate and out of order object numbers are now detected.

            Made functions to read individual rooms and objects, and write
            individual rooms.  Should have write/read functions for all of
            em soon.

            Mobs, objects, and rooms all have individual read/write functions
            per unit now.

            Setting a newly created room to the settings stored in the
            g_defaultRoom record now works, as does reading the default
            info for rooms, mobs, and objects.

            Duplicate and out-of-order mobs are detected.

            Creating a new object, room, or mob uses the defaults read from
            the corresponding default files, if any.

            All defaults are now deletable.

            Mob types are now deleteable.

            Added the "list mobHere" command.

  4/24/96 - All of the zone settings are now editable.

            Added nifty command that lists the sizes of all (or almost all,
            anyway) record types used in dikuEdit.

            A 'zone prefix' of QQ is now added when the user wants it to.
            Zone files that have a prefix already toggle the setting on
            automatically after loading.

            Text editor name is now configurable and works as it's supposed
            ta.

  4/25/96 - The inventory semi-works..  You can pick up and drop copies of
            objects and mobs.  Bugs include - wackiness with copying/not
            copying stuff inside objects or mobs, and not updating the master/
            editable lists in rooms.  Should be easy to fix.. (wink wink)

            Fixed the master/editable list thingy, problem with not copying
            stuff in objects/mobs deals with those darn entityLoaded thingies
            yet again.  Bah.

            Getting and dropping shit works like a gattdamn charm.

            Wewps, still some bugs in the inventory shit..  Bah.

            Fixed the bugs in the inventory shit.  SIMPLE-ASS bug, too.  Was
            forgetting to copy keyword list when picking up objects..  Bah.

  4/26/96 - You can now put objects in mobs and container objects.

            Attempting to change an object type of type "container" is not
            allowed if objHeres are found of this type with objects in em.
            Otherwise, bugs would result in the zone file..

            Previously, placing an object in a container would stick it in the
            first object found that matches the vnum.  Big no-no, now the zone
            reading code actually keeps track of the last object read.

            Fixed a small bug in zone writing with an exit pointing to a room
            that doesn't exist (shouldn't happen, but can't be too careful).

            Need to write code to handle containers with shit in them being
            held by mobs, containers inside containers, etc.  Fun.

  4/27/96 - When setting destinations and keynumbs for exits, the input is
            checked to see if the room numb or obj numb exists.  If not,
            it is not changed..

            The zone prefix string is now written to the room zone number info
            and the zone zone number info, as it should be.

  4/28/96 - A list of objects loaded is now kept track of when loading objects
            into zones.  Thus, sticking objects into other objects now works
            as it should - the object being loaded into a container loads into
            the last instance of the container type loaded.  Neat, eh.

            Updated sector types to the new types listed in the thingy from
            Tripod.  Also added mob "swimming" position.

            Fixed a bug with the "list objHere" and "list mobHere" commands
            that would only check if the end of the room list had been
            reached, and not the end of the objHere or mobHere list for the
            final room - caused the prompt to continue popping up for each
            mob/objHere in the final room.

            Fixed bug with "zone number" not getting written to room recs
            properly when the pre-vnum string thingy is toggled on - I think
            that's right.  At any rate, there was a bug, it's gone now, all is
            good.

            Updated room display functions so they're a bit more efficient
            and easier to read (source-code wise).

            It looks like objects inside objects inside objects (etc etc etc)
            are now written and read correctly.  Yeeeha.

  4/29/96 - Objects inside objects equipped or carried by mobs are now written
            correctly.  Oddly, it was crashing the editor before, but seems to
            work just fine now..

            The editor name now defaults to "edit", an editor that everyone
            with DOS should have.

            Yesterday, I believe, added "set zone number" command, which
            resets all the zone number pointers in the room list and the
            zone number in the g_zoneRec to the number specified.  Kinda handy.

            The lastObjLoaded list is now deleted once the zone file is
            finished loading, saving maybe one kilobyte or so of memory.  YAY!

            The user is now warned before using the renumber command.

            Also, renumbering mobs doesn't seem to update the vnums written to
            the zone file - probably need to update mobHere nodes, easy to do,
            but I gotta go to bed, dammit.

            Used a method for renumbering mobHeres that should have worked, but
            yet, doesn't.  Doh.

            Getting objects from objects works like a charm, as far as I can
            tell.

            Getting objects from mobs that are carrying em in their "carried"
            list works like a charm.

            When dropping, taking, and putting objects, the editor lets you
            know which objects you did stuff to.  Handy.

            You can now equip objects on mobs, though it was acting kinda
            zany earlier..  Seems to work fine now though.

            Unequipping works like a charm.

            The editor is finally FULLY USABLE BAY-BEE.  Aww yeah..

            Released this version.

  4/30/96 - Discovered a few bugs after Hathgar and Xyzom checked out the
            editor -

            The "zone top room number" thing is kooky, so now it just warns
            the user instead of exiting.

            Forgot to update the mob affect flags struct, so when looking at
            a mob it wasn't reporting the mob classes correctly.

            Exit flags in the .WLD and .ZON files have to match, unlike what
            was done in the kobold zone.  Thus, eliminated the "doorState"
            variable, since they'd just be redundant.

            Added the "current" variable to rooms (like the fall flag, only
            with a C instead of an F).

            User is now prompted to set door state in .wld equal to door state
            in .zon instead of exiting the proggie.

            Errors for mob tilde stuff more explicit, and made the string that
            holds mob short and long names 256 bytes instead of 81.

            Expanded strings that needed to be expanded if mob/object names
            were maxed out.

            More door state checking here and there.

            String nodes can now hold up to 256 characters instead of a mere
            128.

            Okay, the exit pairing now works, or appears to.  Also tweaked
            exit checking in big ways...  Fun fun fun.

            Object glow, hum, invis, hidden, secret, and lit bits shown, as are
            mob invis and hide bits.  (Next to objHere and mobHere stuff.)

            The mob species list is now displayed.

            Released this version.

  5/01/96 - A door type of 3 is now accepted and is editable, etc.  Whoops.

            Fixed some rather major bugs in the exit pairing code.  It's all
            better now.

            Mob alignment is now editable.  Whoopsie.

            Released this version.

  5/02/96 - When displaying a list of stringNodes, the color is reset to
            fg 7, bg 0 each newline, as per dikuMud.

            There was a little bug that caused a bracket to be displayed
            next to a mobHere if there were objectHeres previously listed -
            tis fixed now.

            Tried to create code that removes empty lines from the end
            of stringNode lists, apparently it doesn't remove the lines,
            and trailing spaces aren't trimmed correctly either.  Bah.

            It works now..  Whee.  stringNode lists are "fixed" when reading
            em from files, and after editing em.

            Fixed a bug that caused the QQ prepending to get messed up
            occasionally.

  5/03/96 - The "no vnum checking" stuff seems to work perfectly.

            Vnum checking is now toggleable from inside the editor..  Yay.

            The top room number is now set to the highest room number in the
            zone, as it should be.

            Fixing various things with the "QQ" stuff and writing comments
            for objects not in the .obj or mobs not in the .mob..  yadda
            yadda.

            Fixed tiny little color bug with creating a default room.
            (Prompt had color code improperly entered)

            Fixed a bug that was causing the editor to crash..  If you were
            editing the room desc within the "edit room" menu and returned
            from the external text editor with a blank desc, boom, it was all
            over.  Go figure.

            "Main" name of zone files can now be up to 71 characters, allowing
            for full paths.

            Object and mob types now start at 0 instead of 1.

            Last pointer wasn't being built properly when reading rooms..
            Thus, when deleting rooms, bad things happened.  Tis fixed now.

            You no longer have to make an exit leading to a new room.

            When creating a new zone, you are prompted for the starting vnum
            to stick shit at.

  5/04/96 - Due to a silly little bug, mob/object types would not be deleted
            if no instances of the entity existed.

            Took out some unnecessary code..

            Fixed up the entity pointer checking when writing comments in
            zone files.

            Still some problems with renumbering mobs and having the numb of
            entities loaded updating improperly...  Duh, gotta renumber that
            too.

            Fixed a bug with the entityLoaded list not being updated when
            mobs and objects were renumbered..  Should work now.

            Renumber seems to work right now...  Wahoo

            Added the "list loaded entities" command.

            Field 0 of objects of type ITEM_KEY is now considered unused.

  5/06/96 - More checking for entity type pointers in here nodes, what with the
            "no vnum checking" option n all.

            Object renumbering inside object values should work now.

            Strangely, renumbering no longer works correctly..  Bah

            Renumbering of mobs worked; objects didn't because objects on
            mobs and inside other objects weren't being renumbered.  Tis
            fixed now.

            Yeeha, fields referencing room numbers are now renumbered as
            well..

            Some little bugs with incrementing numb objs loaded in entityLoaded
            list and on prompt when putting objs in objs, and some other shit
            too.

            Objects inside containers are not checked for when giving objects
            to mobs or putting them inside other containers.  Thus, the
            entityLoaded list is not properly updated..  Apparently, picking
            up mobs and dropping copies updates the list properly, though.

            Objects inside other objects now have the zone comments indented
            two spaces per "layer"..  Doesn't always line up right, but ain't
            nothin I can do about that, really.

            entityLoaded list is now mostly updated correctly.  When deleting
            a bunch of objHeres with shit inside them, it ain't working right,
            though.

  5/07/96 - entityLoaded stuff should be correct now, in theory.

            Looks like it works...  Kooky.

            The QQ prefix thingy works perfectly now, and is stuck at the start
            of everything it should be, I think.

            When picking up objects and mobs, the entityLoaded counter was
            being decremented twice (once in the get() function, once in the
            deleteBlehHere() function).

            Objects with affect flags are now recognized properly, all that's
            left is to edit them and write them properly.

            Affect flags are written and editable properly now..

            The "list obj type" and "list mob type" commands now take keyword
            arguments and only display the obj and mob types that match the
            keyword (kinda like the "lookup" command, eh?).

            The "list room" command now does the same, only does a substring
            search on the room name.

            Added the "lookup" command - searches through all lists to find
            matches with keywords/room names.

            Added keyword matching to "goto" command - doesn't recognize
            objects inside objects or on mobs, however.

  5/08/96 - The "list objectHere" command now lists objects inside other
            objects.  Next will be stuff carried by mobs, and stuff equipped
            by mobs.

            The "list objHere" command now shows stuff carried and equipped by
            mobs.

            Added the "where" command, it finds all instances of whatevers
            perfectly.

            Fixed some bugs with decrementing the loaded list when unequipping
            and equipping mobs.

            Added "Dikuish" equivalents to many commands.

            The "purge" command now works for purging all items in a room.

            Purge command now recognizes vnums of objs and mobs and deletes
            first that matches.

            Need to update "list obj" and "list mob" commands to do the same
            as "list room" command does (arg versions).

            Released as version 1.0.

  5/09/96 - Started working on the Linux ver on Duris, it mostly works,
            though it isn't showing stuff in color for some kooky reason.

            Filenames are no longer uppercased.

            Fixed a little bug in exit-pairing stuff - strangely, crashes
            under Linux but works fine under DOS, when indeed it was a rather
            glaring error.  Cringe.

  5/10/96 - Colors work in the Linux version, though they seem mismatched..

  5/11/96 - Changed control-keys in flags.c to more unix-friendly ascii
            keys.  (The old keys still work, thank the lord)

            Added "exits" command.

            The "level restriction" flag is no longer editable nor is it
            saved to the .WLD file.  It is still read, however.

            Zone and world exit flags are now set and written separately.  No
            error-checking yet, though, I don't think.

            Both zone and room door state are both editable.  Both flags
            are also displayed next to exits.

  5/12/96 - Added "set door state" command checking - if command sets door type
            to non-zero, door type in .wld has to have a type as well.  (secret
            and blocked bits can be set regardless)

            Apparently still some oddness with exit door checking - readded
            "exit pair" checking code, things seem to be a bit kooky.  Test it,
            dammit.

            Changed "edit exit" menu so it's a bit more clear - zone door
            state command can no longer be set to "unpickable", should add
            error-checking for that.

  5/13/96 - Added the same checking for "set door state" crap as mentioned in
            5/12 above, except it now checks when writing the zone file as well
            as reading it.  Still need to test it out though, really..

            Apparently all the exit checking is now done correctly.  YAY

  5/14/96 - All of the room menus now use the checkMenuKey() and MENU_COMMON
            stuff - every menu should be updated soon.

            Ditto for mob menus.

            Fixed up some input problems on mob menu stuff.

            A few fatal errors when loading changed to warnings.

            Object menus and extra desc menu are now updated properly.

            Object menus now also recognize the more modularized menu key
            stuff.

  5/15/96 - Adding command table stuff, it works - will need to modify all
            commands that take arguments (heh, or just plain create them
            instead of hacking around).

            Object extra desc shit changed, though I forget exactly why.  Life
            is kooky.

            Moved tons o source to the misc/ subdir, updated all other source
            so that it compiles..

            Right now the checkCommands() function always calls execCommand()
            to interpret codes - need to make checkCommands() take a pointer
            to an execCommand() function to execute, but I forget how to pass
            pointers to functions.  :)

            checkCommands() works right - now adding commands and
            interpretations slowly but surely

  5/16/96 - Added most of the commands, though not all of them work like they
            used to, or even properly - "look in" is acting strange, and I
            don't really know why

            Fixed crap with look in, still not really sure why it doesn't
            work with a strnPos != 0, except that the checkMaster.. function
            is kinda kooky.

            Alrighty - zone states and door types revisited - a zone state
            of 0 is perfectly alright, even with a door.  what is not okay is
            a zone state of 1 or 2 when the door type is no door.  that's it,
            the only thing that is Not Okay.  everything else is Just Dandy.
            well, and the matching exits shit.  basically, write a zone door
            state command if a world door type exists.  doesn't matter what
            zone door state is, cuz it just fucking doesn't matter.

  5/17/96 - Added "no limit checking" option.

            Alrighty, the exit checking now works exactly as it should - zone
            doorstates of 0 are allowed on doors of type != 0...  door types
            are also checked now.

            If an unrecognized vnum is found while loading shit in the .zon
            file and vnum checking is on, a prompt pops up asking if you
            want to turn it off.  It's handy.

            Whoops, forgot to update "edit room exits" menu with new interface
            stuff.

            Fixed "delete exit" command so it accepts args and fixed up spacing
            in "edit exit" menu.

            Linux ver segfaults when reading empty .obj file.

            Zone top room number is no longer editable.

            Updated zone menu with new menu key code.  (oops)

            Put in a little code that should fix the segfault under Linux..
            Only time will tell.

            Mobs' various aggro flags are now displayed as well as hidden/inv.

  5/18/96 - Exits can now be created/deleted from the edit room exit menu.

            Added parameter checking to "edit room" command - thus, you can now
            edit any room from anywhere as long as you know the vnum.

            Alrighty, all the commands accept arguments one way or another -
            now need to add "load", "stat", "delete", "create", "list" commands,
            remove all the cheesy alias thingies, and add real aliases (and
            variables).

            The "where" command now takes vnums, and loves them.  Next is the
            powerful "lookup" command.

            Cleaned up "lookup" command, now '===' lines are only displayed if
            they actually separate a list of rooms and objs or a list of objs
            and mobs.  Oh yeah, the "lookup" command now also enjoys the
            presence of vnums.  Not sure why you'd want to use vnums on lookup,
            but maybe you're a kooky-ass loser.

            Hmm, if objects are in an object a mob is carrying, it isn't
            indented as it should be in the .zon file..  The question is,
            should I care?

  5/19/96 - Fixed up functions in strings.c so that they check ranges, blah
            blah..

            Command-line options can now start with either / or - (or even
            neither).

            Updating goto() command - check to make sure numeric code works
            right, and change it so that it goes to the room on the first
            match of obj, mob, or room, instead of scanning backwards, which
            is just zany.  Also, scan through obj lists on objs and mobs.

            Sometime or another, changed the code that shows the door states
            for exits - now, a door with a door type != 0 in the .wld and a
            zone state = 0 has an "O" displayed to indicate it is open..
            and, unpickable doors are now "U" instead of "P" (P?  huh?)  btw,
            just for the hell of it, these letters should be configurable.

            The "goto" command now works for objects in objects and objects
            carried and equipped by mobs.

            A looong time ago, increased max room name from 61ish to 128.

  5/20/96 - "lookup" command now takes room, obj, and mob args, just like diku.

            editStringNodes() now clears the screen after editing a desc -
            updated all calling funcs so that the screen is refreshed.  this
            was done for spammy editors like qedit..

            The "look" command is better now.  It even tells you if you try to
            look at a room extra desc w/o a desc (is that fucked, or what).

            Before adding a command entry to the command list, dupes are
            checked for.

            Added "create" command - can currently create rooms, obj/mob types -
            should take vnum args soon.

            Added "load" command - still doesn't take keyword args, should add
            em.

            Fixed color bugs with Linux version.

            Better input checking on createObjHere and createMobHere functions.

            The command interpreter now removes leading and trailing spaces
            before splitting into args, cuz spaces before the command name
            were tweaking it.  Happy, eh?

            Added "exit" to "create", took out all the create aliases, cuz
            they're lame.

            Found bug that was corrupting the loaded list - the deleteRoomInfo()
            func was always decrementing the objs and mobs loaded in that room,
            even if it was a copy made while editing.  DOH!

  5/21/96 - Added "list" command, removed all the cheesy aliases.

            Added "createedit" command, works for rooms, mobs, objects, and
            exits - oh, removed all those damn aliases.

            Fixed little bug with checking for unpaired exits that would check
            the secret and blocked bits, but not reset them.  Now, the secret
            and blocked bits are ignored, cuz hell, screw em.

            Exits can now be created by typing "CREATE EXIT NORTH" ..  in other
            words, args are recognized.  Were they before?  Probably.  But it
            works once again, and that's neat.

            Changed dupe checking so that only duplicate command strings are
            checked, instead of dupe numbers - after all, dupe numbers are
            handy.

            Room info no longer shows number of masterListNodes (aww damn), and
            recsize info now shows size of command and alias recs (yay).

            Exit info when looking at an exit now shows both the world type and
            zone state and even makes more sense (wahoo).

            Let's see - main commands left to add are stat and delete.

            Fixed various little bugs with various list functions - namely,
            the "list room" thingy, the "list mobhere" thingy, and the "list
            loaded" thingy.

            Added function that removes excess spaces between arguments.

            Aliases can now be defined, listed, and deleted.

  5/22/96 - Aliases are read from and written to de.set, g_madeChanges is set
            whenever an alias is changed, and they are interpreted exactly as
            they should be.  Hallelujah.

            Moved command-related source to command/ subdir.

            editStringNodes() should theoretically report the reason why it
            couldn't execute the editor - perhaps it will work under Linux.

            Added "delete" command, removed all the horrible aliases.  Now,
            there are no horrid aliases left, and all is good.

            Fixed bug with del objhere and del mobhere commands that would
            crash the editor if you tried to delete a mob/objhere in a room
            that didn't have any.  Ouch.

            Error messages on del obj/mob type/here now show up when they
            should and are more explicit.

            Fixed the keyword matching vers of the list mob/obj commands so
            that they display better (specifically, in the same manner that
            I fixed the list room func earlier).

            Added "stat" command, modified the displayRoomInfo() func to take
            string args.

            Blocked exits need to be set on both sides, just like other doors -
            previously, the editor wasn't even saving exits with blocked
            states..  that works now, but the pairing isn't checked for while
            reading or writing.  fix it.

            Updated room sector types and other new stuff.

  5/23/96 - Variables are now fully implemented, switched several lame global
            vars over to these variable thingies, got rid of commands
            associated with lame global vars.

            de.set is now read before all others, cuz I said so.

            Fixed edit obj/mob type commands so that they show the prompt if
            no args - would be nice to add the same error-checking as with
            del obj/mob type/here stuffs.

            Should probably specify a displayScreen and displayColor variable
            for the set alias and set var functions, or something.

            Variable and alias listings now pause each screenful.

            Still need to make exit pairing check for blocked bit not set on
            both sides.

            Variable values are no longer uppercased when reading from file,
            but they still are when being entered at the prompt.  No easy way
            to fix this..

            The goto command would only go to a room whose title matched
            sometimes (I dunno the exact circumstances, but who cares).  It's
            all better now.

            About the upcasing thing - now only the first argument is
            uppercased by interp.c (probably the command name, eh).  The
            mainExecCommand() thingy now uppercases the rest if the matching
            command wasn't the "set var" command.  Yay.

            Dikuedit now looks first for default files that start with the
            zone name (new extensions..)..  Well actually, first it reads
            "de.dwd" etc, then it reads "<zonename>.<blah>", so that they
            get replaced if existant..  Blah, at any rate, you can now
            specify defaults for each zone and have "default defaults".

            Added code to write rooms in correct order whether or not they
            are in the list sorted - it works.  That was hard.

            g_madeChanges is never updated when updateChanges is FALSE in
            setVar and addAlias.

            added cheesy global var so that no spam is shown when loading
            .set file

            vnum changing of rooms works just dandy

  5/24/96 - vnum changing on objs and mobs works just fine now, as well..
            all that's left now is to allow you to specify vnum at creation
            by typing "create blah vnum"

            made args override vars in .set files, added /vnumcheck and
            /limitcheck

            the create and createedit now both take vnum args, and they work
            like a charm

            updated config menu to use new menu stuff, added "check vnum"
            toggle

            fixed little bug with setVarBool not updating g_madeChanges when it
            should

            blocked doors - ensuring that both sides are blocked isn't hard,
            but I'm too lazy to fix it now.  as long as it saves the blocked
            bit state, I really don't care, for right now

            added "setEntityOverride" func

            the "limit" function is now read from both settings files and
            the prompt, it works for both objs and mobs, and is written to
            the zone file properly - what's left is to have it write the
            limit commands to the <zone>.set

            hmm, apparently limit command is not read from de.set properly,
            or probably <zone>.set either.  damn.

            reading limit overrides from .set files now works, added flag
            to getNumbLoaded() func as to whether to return overrideNumb (if
            it exists) or not

            the main settings file is no longer written, just read - thus,
            you can have default settings that are read when first creating
            a zone, and then written to the <mainname>.set file

  5/25/96 - working on little proggie to set/unset certain bits in a room/obj/
            mob file - mostly works, not much more to add

            finished proggie, compiled under unix

            readded "swapexits" command - whoops

            fixed a couple of bugs discovered with reading files (they once
            again only show themselves in unix, proving that dos ain't so
            great)

  5/26/96 - the "swapexits" command now once again displays output

            for some reason, sprintf was getting passed addresses of third
            and fourth elements of the "obj apply" array, which of course
            don't exist.  hmm. - this was in the "edit obj misc" menu

            "stat obj" works

  5/27/96 - fixed up "stat obj" for good

            added "toggle" command, toggles boolean vars

            fixed up getStrn function so that on non-wide fields it doesn't
            redraw the whole field when deleting and adding characters

            added isVarBoolean func, toggle now only toggles "actual"
            booleans

            added "stat mob"

            added "stat zone"

  5/28/96 - copy[Obj|Mob]Here[List] funcs now take an arg as to whether or not
            to increment the loaded list

            added "clone room" command

            you can now delete the exits of the cloned rooms..  also fixed a
            bug that was cloning the wrong room.  but hey, it's all good.

            added "clone objtype" and "clone mobtype" commands

            can now set limit override on objects from "edit obj" menu

            for some reason, keyword lists weren't lowercased before being
            written.  doh.

            can now set limit override on mobs from "edit mob" menu

  5/29/96 - started adding code to get objects using vnums - fixed showInv
            code so that it wouldn't crash when running through an inventory
            with objHeres with NULL objectPtr pointers

            a while back, made it so that the first extra desc created for an
            obj has keywords set to that of the object - just hadn't tested it
            until now.  ;)

            createKeywordStrn wasn't lowercasing strn at the right time if
            keyStrn was specified - was the cause of the problems.  bah

            can now use vnums when getting objs from containers for both obj
            being gotten and container

  5/30/96 - updated changes file to here

            worked on getting objs from mobs - for some reason, it's broken
            so that it thinks the mob is never carrying anything - very
            strange, this happens with both vnums and keywords

  5/31/96 - fixed up insertChar function - wasn't quite right before

            apparently, fixing insertChar fixed a bug with QQ shit that was
            fucking up the "abaddon" zone

            duh, getting objs from mobs works fine, however vnums are still
            not recognized

            I lied - vnums are now recognized when getting objs from mobs.

            Moved alias.c, clone.c, etc to command/ subdir, as well as
            purge.c and look.c from misc/

            a while back, made it so that the edit command, when scanning for
            matching keywords, also checked inventory..  first room is checked,
            then inventory, and the number dot notation crap keeps track, so
            that if there are 3 "kobold"s in the room and 3 in your inventory,
            "edit 4.kobold" edits the first in your inventory, etc

            The purge command only updated g_madeChanges when all objs/mobs
            in a room were deleted - also modified it to use an args string
            instead of a string and string pos - more efficient, blah blah blah

            modified takeEntity to take args with no strnPos, fixed it so that
            it will pick up objects when a vnum is specified - mobs work now
            as well

  6/01/96 - modified dropEntity to take only args, and it now accepts vnums
            like you wouldn't believe

            unequip now recognizes a mobHere with no corresponding mob type,
            and displays the mob name correctly

            changed "put" so that it accepts an args string with no pos

            fixed up some bugs with equip that would've popped up if you tried
            to equip objects with objectPtr == NULL, and with equipping mobs
            with no mobPtr - also modified equip to take no pos arg

            can now put objs in other objs using vnums for the object being
            put in

            a while back, changed "hum" bit to noshow bit for objs, noshow is
            shown like magic, etc for objs when lying around in rooms

            can now put objs in mobs using vnums for mob

            fixed up all refs in the inventory stuff, in case I forgot to
            mention some above - that is, checks obj/mobPtr, if NULL, lets
            ya know that the obj/mob type doesn't exist in your zone

  6/02/96 - can now purge mobs/objs based on keyword

            deleteMobHere and related funcs now take boolean var as to whether
            or not to decrement the loaded list

            added "purge all" (deletes all obj and mobHeres in zone) and
            "purge inv" (deletes all stuff in your inventory) command modifier
            thingies

            swapexits, where, goto, renumber, and set zone numb commands no
            longer take a pos parameter - makes things more efficient

            added "copydesc" command, can currently copy room descs

            copydesc now copies mob descs as well

            added "dumptext" command, dumps a file to screen line-by-line

            added "purge allobj" and "purge allmob" command modifiers

            made dumpTextFile() take a boolean as to whether or not to interp
            color codes, changed the "dumptext" command to not interp colors,
            and the "display help" functions interpret color (as always)

            fixed bug with purge() not updating master and editable lists in
            rooms - ouch

            added var that controls whether or not first obj extra desc copies
            keywords of obj - not sure why you'd want to turn this off, but
            hey, who cares - can also toggle var from config menu

            added "show obj flags" var - controls whether or not object flags
            are shown in room thingy

            added "show mob flags" and "show mob pos" vars - do what you'd
            expect

            added "show obj vnum" var - currently only works for rooms, should
            update it for inventory and stuff inside objs, and uhh, probably
            some other stuff I'm forgetting

            fixed the "toggle boolean" func, which was expecting TRUE, FALSE,
            etc to be in all caps..  obviously, this isn't always going to be
            the case

            added "show mob vnum" var

            added "show room extra" var - controls whether or not the sector
            type and flags are displayed

            added "show room vnum" var

            the "look" command now respects the setting of the "show obj vnum"
            var

            note that with all obj/mob vnums, if the type doesn't exist, the
            vnum is still shown, since it's the only way to 'access' the obj/mob

            added "interpret color code" and "display color code" options, they
            all work except for background stuff

            moved all display-related options to a separate "edit display" menu

            equipment on mobs now also respects vnum settings

            added "turn all display options on/off" options to edit display menu

            fixed up background stuff, wasn't quite right - the flashing stuff
            seems a bit tweaky, as in, it doesn't work.  but at least I tried.

  6/03/96 - added flag template arrays and template key array

            defined 'menu prompt' var, just need to implement it

            updating all menus with new menu prompt var slowly but surely..

            fully added new menu prompt, it's now configurable

            when interpreting var commands from commandline and reading them,
            spaces are not trimmed from the end

            prompt is now definable - setting it to 'default' causes it to use
            the normal prompt

            OBJECT_MISSILE is now recognized in edit obj menu, and has all the
            nifty features of other listed object types

            added "settemplate" command, currently recognizes templates for
            room flags, obj extra, and obj wear flags - can set and copy
            templates from menus - template settings are also read and written
            from .set file

            object wear flag menu never got updated with updateFlag() stuff -
            it is now

            changed set flag template and set entity flag shit to fkeys and
            shifted fkeys - will need to be changed for Linux, but will be
            easy

            oh yeah, and all the flag menus should now properly respect the
            templates

            setVarBoolVal() now takes a parameter as to whether or not to
            update g_madeChanges

            updated config menu to properly respect abort, quit, and update
            g_madeChanges accordingly

            updated display config menu to properly respect same

            added "create as you go" room creation mode

            fixed bug with dumpTextFile() displaying last line twice

            added "display exit dest vnum" and "display exit flag" options

  6/04/96 - rewrote DE.DOC

            added room arg to "createedit"

            rewrote DEHELP.HLP

            included dur_doc.txt in de200.zip

            fixed rather glaring error with sprintf() statements in
            writeDefaultFiles()

            "Zone edited by dikuEdit v2.0" is now written to the .zon file

            added current dir and current strength to room info command,
            fixed current dir prompt in edit room menu so it shows help

            added "copydefault" command - copies one of the current room/obj/
            mobs to the corresponding default

            fixed long-standing bug with 'edit room edesc' and 'edit obj edesc'
            menus checking character input more than once, so that if you
            deleted an edesc, it would check the input for which edesc to
            delete again, as though you were trying to edit it - this caused
            very bad things to happen, apparently.  or, maybe not, as the
            crashes were likely caused by the editable list bug below, but it
            couldn't have been a good thing

  6/05/96 - edited room, changed name, saved, edited room again, changed name,
            saved, crashed - crash report says it died in deleteStringNodes()
            this bug is so reproducible, it's scary!

            had updated deleteRoomAssoc() and deleteRoomInfo() to delete
            editable list, but wasn't copying it in copyRoomInfo().  whoops.

            that fixed the bug mentioned above.  good thing, cuz that bug
            sucked.

  6/06/96 - released this version as 2.0, made Linux ver

            fixed little bug with exit key numb input checking not allowing 0
            if vnum checking is enabled.  also, exit key field is now checked
            for non-numerics

            bug with renumbering - exits with key number of 0 will be
            renumbered..  don't.

            fixed bug with exit key number = 0 renumber stuff

            dumptext command uppercases argument, making it pretty much
            useless under Linux - fixed, just does same thing as setvar
            command

            took out code that checked to see if key numb contained only
            numerics - gotta allow negative numbs, after all.  duh

            when looking at an exit, a keynumb of -1 is now recognized.
            cleaned up -2 stuff a little too (it said door TYPE is -2,
            when indeed it's really door KEY NUMBER.  big bug)

            update look command to run through room editableList first, then
            inventory

            crashed when trying to edit mob by keyword

            fixed little bug with deleteRoomAssoc() not setting all deleted
            list heads to NULL..  may have caused problems here and there

            some kind of strange bug with object values not always being
            updated when they should be

            with blocked exits, both sides don't have to be blocked - and
            world door type shouldn't be set to blocked..  (?)

  6/07/96 - now, a door with the blocked bit set is basically only checked
            for not having a corresponding door on the opposite side.
            anything else is allowed.

            if saveStartRoom (something like that) is set, user will be
            popped over to room specified in whatever the var that
            specifies the vnum is

            created records to hold quest info, started working on .QST
            reading function

            mob message interaction stuff is read right, working on quest
            reading stuff..

            expanded length of edesc keyword lists from 41 to 61

            quest stuff is now read properly, as far as I can tell

  6/08/96 - started work on quest editing stuff, looks like it should be a
            bitch..

            prevented extraneous saves caused by not checking to see if the
            "STARTROOM" variable was already set to the g_currentRoom/not
            setting it when saving and not exiting/whatever

  6/09/96 - fixed yet another bug with editable/master lists with not updating
            em after deleting an obj/mob type.  so, if you tried to edit a
            mob/obj in a room that previously had it and no longer does, boom.
            trying to get objects may have caused it to crash, too..  anyway,
            it's fixed

            fixed segfault when using getkey() before curses is initialized
            in Linux ver.  doh.

  6/11/96 - added "!" command - repeats last command typed

  6/13/96 - added default exit stuff - currently, .dex is read and new exits
            are set correctly.  will add other stuff later.  honest.

            changed name of var SROOMON to SAVESROOM (something like that),
            and now, strangely, it isn't saving the SAVESROOM var.  odd.

            typing "toggle" by itself now shows the state of all boolean
            vars

            forgot to check obj values in compareObjType() - doh

            fixed bug that was renumbering key fields of obj containers == 0
            when renumbering from 0

            changed name of SAVESTARTROOM var yet again..  and the bug
            mentioned above didn't exist (surprise surprise)

            looking at mobs with quest info now lets you know just that.
            woowoo

            added SHOWMENUINFO var, updated room menu, and uhh, it's neato

            changed object weight var from uint to long, for those darn
            "bottomless" containers

  6/14/96 - added menu info stuff to edit obj menu

            removed extra blank lines shown when quitting from edit menus

            added menu info stuff to edit mob menu

            can now edit default exits

            fully added default exits

            added menu info stuff to edit exit menu

            added menu info stuff to edit extra desc menu, realized it
            wasn't needed, and removed it

            moved mainName and lastCommand to user-definable vars

            addCommand() function now takes arg that points to head
            of linked list instead of assuming global var

            "exits" command now lists target vnum as well as room name

            fixed little bug with hitting Q in the middle of the mob
            species list not displaying extra linefeeds

  6/15/96 - fixed display bug with exit checking when loading .ZON file
            (woohoo)

            Kelarian reported bug with inventory - changing keywords of
            obj munges inv so you can't use keywords.  also need to fix
            it so that deleting obj/mob types deletes corresponding shit
            in inventory

            screen is now cleared right after calling editor, instead of
            after any errors - DOH!

            fixed segfault on creating new zone in Linux ver - calling
            getStrn before initializing screen

            fixed dumbass bug that wasn't allowing any vnums when vnum
            checking was off (that is, for exit keynumb)

  6/16/96 - added badge stuff - mob equip pos constant may be wrong, but obj
            wear bit is correct

            can now use "look at" to look at stuff

  6/17/96 - act_animal replaced by teacher bit (not imped yet)

            newmob - only set necros to necro if their keyword list has
            "necromancer" or "necro"

            mob classes are now read/written/editable correctly

            all keyword lists have trailing and leading spaces trimmed
            upon reading from files - need to add same to user input

            added above-mentioned keyword input stuff

            added detailed info shit for mob hometown and classes, added
            help list for hometowns

            added support for "exit" arg in copydef command

  6/18/96 - added vnum arg support for "createedit room", modified
            createRoomPrompt() to return boolean based on whether it failed
            or not

            new objs/rooms/mobs get first free vnum instead of highest + 1
            now

            clone command with no "number to clone" arg now clones once

            can now set zone number from edit zone menu

            added Linux-specific ifdefs that should make it nice n easy to
            compile under Linux

            fixed up wackiness with numbLoaded vars for rooms, exits, etc
            not always being set correctly

            can now use < and > to scroll through room menu - it rawks

            can now use < and > on objs and mobs as well

            replaced "is animal" flag with "teacher" flag (mob action)

            fixed "x-key exits" bug with editing mob act flags

            when loading, zone numbers are checked against room numbers and
            a zone numb of 0 is not allowed.

            a starting numb of 0 on new zones is no longer allowed

  6/19/96 - released this version as 2.1

            "goto" command would only check first object on a mob or in a
            container..  whoops

            removed one of the extra linefeeds at bottom of mob menu

            fixed stupid-ass color bugs in Linux

            copyRoomInfo wasn't incrementing g_numbRooms if incNumbLoaded was
            set - bah

            edited room desc, made room with walkcreate by accident, deleted
            room along with exit, tried to look at a container with objs in
            it, displayed first obj and crashed

  6/21/96 - removed demon/humanoid/insect/dragon flags

  6/22/96 - all non-scanf'd lines now have trailing/leading spaces trimmed
            as appropriate

            mob species strn is upcased upon reading and writing

            editing a room, changing something, and attempting to edit an
            object in that room dies

            deleteRoomInfo() wasn't deleting editableLists - small memory
            leak

            problem is this - mobs/objs are copied, pointers change, but
            are not updated in editable/master list

            fixed bug with editable/master lists not being updated right
            after editing a room, inevitably causing a crash

            all new mob types are now marked as NPCs unless overridden by
            default mob

  6/23/96 - currently, hitting L to set override limit and then hitting
            enter sets override to current limit.  this is bad.

  6/24/96 - limit overrides are not written for give/equip commands on
            mobs

            "list loaded" command now also shows override if non-zero

  6/25/96 - fixed stupid bug with exit keynumb being written as unsigned

            fixed display bug with exits with out-of-range keynumbs under
            Linux

            released this version as 2.11

            changed toggle message to match "set" message - now reports
            variable name and is ever so colorful

            added error checking for "die strings" of mobs when reading

            fixed up exit menu so that instead of taking invalid input and
            forcing user to type it again, it redisplays the field - also
            more efficient, and took out saveScreen() restoreScreen()
            stuff.

            added die-string error checking to input on menus, made various
            prompts "persist" and got rid of semi-inefficient code

            .QST file is now read/written correctly

            adding more .QST stuff - need to make functions to delete
            stuff, not a real big deal though

  6/26/96 - oddness with losing pathname before filenames...  very very
            strange indeed (i.e. you type "de \bleh\blah", it won't
            read it, usually)

            duh - it reads DE.SET from specified directory.  it has
            mainName set.  thus, all files after that are read from
            current dir.  bah.  way to fix this - if mainName already
            set when reading .SET file, ignore setting in .SET.  and
            of course mainName is already set.

            edit quest menu now shows all messages and quests for that
            mob, each with a unique letter..  one problem is overflow from
            mobs with megaquests..

            quest message editing works like a charm

            for some reason g_madeChanges is being updated whether quests
            are changed or not ...

            can now delete messages from quest editing menu

  6/27/96 - can no longer set override limits equal to object limit from
            edit obj menu

            can now delete quests from quest editing menu

            can now create messages/quests from quest editing menu

            can now create quests for mobs without them in mob menu

            if mob has quest, verbose edit menu sez so

            may be something wrong with room deleting..

            edit "quest quest" menu is now displayed

            can now edit quest disappearance message and reply

            can now delete items wanted/given for quest and disp msg,
            and create items wanted/given

            quests should now be fully editable - need to add help
            lists, etc

            verbose edit obj/mob menus now show amount loaded and override
            amount

            MAINZONENAME is no longer read from .SET files

            <zonename>.QST is deleted if no quests exist

            quest info for mob can now be deleted

            unlink() seems unreliable, file is just truncated at 0 now
            if unlink fails

            added "read from Diku dirs" option - currently reads from
            wld/ obj/ etc, doesn't write to them, however, yet

            still need to work on quest numbering past letters, btw

  6/28/96 - "read from Diku dirs" option now writes to subdirs as well

            fixed numbering display probs for quests - however, number keys
            still aren't working for editing

            g_madeChanges is still always updated when editing a mob - this
            sucks, Beavis - all the bugs appear to have been worked out

            fixed stupid g_madeChanges bug - was comparing mobSpecies pointers
            as well as string contents..  BAH.

            numeric key stuff now works perfectly

            quest item editing now shows context-sensitive help

  6/29/96 - can now delete quests with "delete" command

            can now edit quests with "edit quest" or "edit quest #"

            can now list quest mobs with "list quest" or "list quest <keyword>"

            cannot edit quest if it is only existing item

            fixed little bug with quest mentioned above - existed with
            quest item editing, too

            released this version as 2.12

            went through command/misccomm.c and removed all the "pos"
            arguments, now just need to update those functions and all
            other calls

  6/30/96 - renumbering your zone to a vnum that already matches one
            in your zone fucks everything up - to fix, specify amount
            to increment/decrement all vnum refs by, and then renumber
            to remove gaps

            removed all the "pos" crap

            renumbering is a problem - not sure how to solve it except
            to make a copy, renumber from originals, delete originals -
            this would work - only do it if necessary, however

            quests no longer have "mobNumb" variable, thus making
            renumbering, etc, much more simple and fixing bugs therein

            doh, still need to renumber all obj numbs referenced inside
            quest rec

            another alternate method for renumbering would be to renumber all
            vnum refs like 1000 ahead of the highest, then renumber like that.
            hell, that should work just fine.

            bug with renumbering fixed with aforementioned modification

            problem with exits with destinations that rooms are renumbered to -
            same with objects..  only way to fix this is to make a copy and
            renumber from the originals, then delete the originals.  I phear
            doing this.  This would suck.

   7/1/96 - exit pairs are getting written twice - once for each side.
            obviously, I broke something

            sentinel mobs now have an "S" shown next to their name

            fixed problem with exit pairs getting written twice

            blank lines in room info are now ignored, as are spaces here
            and there when converting vnums and all that shit.  basically
            whitespace no longer crashes dikuEdit as much, and .WLD files
            should be bulletproof

            all reading is now bullet-proof, baby, except .QST stuff

            quest vnum refs are now renumbered - vnum refs that don't
            reference a vnum in the zone aren't renumbered, but this is a
            good thing, I think

            wimpy and teacher mobs now have "W" and "T" shown next to
            their name, respectively

  7/02/96 - added new SPELLS.H yesterday, still need to add new types

            added new SPELLS.H types in objtypes.c

            deleting an object type that has existing objectHeres doesn't
            decrement numb of objs loaded

            some oddness with "look in" ..  doesn't always match keywords

  7/03/96 - fixed "look in"

            if zone top numb references the incorrect vnum (too low), a
            warning is displayed

            'R' command is no longer read and ignored (DOH!), 'F' is
            recognized, though not as it should be

  7/04/96 - fixed bug with g_numbObjs not always being properly updated

            now reads and writes "R" and "F" commands in .ZON, and shows
            mobs being ridden/riding/following.  keywords don't seem to
            be copied, and even if they were, purge doesn't update the
            pointers for mounts etc quite yet..  and btw, the numb objs
            loaded thing looped back somehow, going to 4.4 billion

            released as 2.12b, fixed bug with reading/writing R and F wrong,
            released as 2.12c, both as Linux-only versions for Tripod

  7/14/96 - was on vacation - bahhh

            added north/south, west/east, and up/down exit swapping

            added grid creation - it works, though is slow for big grids
            (30x30 or so) - the real problem is that linked lists are
            slooooooooow, and finding the first free room numb etc. doesn't
            help any - so really, it's the number of rooms existing, not
            the grid creation itself

            added show mob ride/follow option to display menu

            all info read from .WLD is now checked for numb of args

            made error messages when reading .OBJ and .MOB a bit
            more clear and replaced replaceable code when reading
            .ZON

  7/15/96 - yay - moved COPYDEF and COPYDESC to args for COPY, making
            the syntax all the more confusing

            made "getArg" function, grabs specified argument from string

            updated quest menus so that they show existing descs -
            ditto for exit and edesc menus - this is verbose menu mode

            updated copyDesc and copyDef to use getArg

            can now list main commands with "commands" command

  7/16/96 - added new defvar crap for check-related vars

  7/18/96 - started adding check command stuff

  7/21/96 - on vacation yet again - updated DE.DOC here and there

  7/22/96 - fixed some miscellaneous quest function thingies

            added exit-checking code for door type/keywords, it works
            like a charm, the rest of the code should be in shortly

            added exit desc checking, obj container checking, lone room
            checking

            added obj/mob desc checking and mob checking

            added check configuration menu

            fixed problem with cloned rooms not having master/editable
            lists recreated properly

            added "check every save" option as it should be..  everything
            about check now works like a dream, just need to add edesc
            checking and perhaps that "obj has wear bits but not takeable"
            thing

            added "abort on saving if errors" option

            added edesc checking

            added "mount" command, works like a charm

            added "unmount" command, ditto

            added follow/unfollow, only problem is with following in loops,
            but I can't think of a real easy way to fix this..  it can
            only happen with >= 3 mobs

  7/23/96 - made quest error messages more explicit and helpful, quest keyword
            lists now have spaces trimmed

            a list is now kept of limits specified when loading objs and mobs
            in the zone file - if the highest limit is higher than the actual
            number, the override is set to this.  yay

            if creating a mob/obj would make the loaded limit higher than the
            override limit (and there is an override limit), the override
            limit is now set to the loaded limit, preventing quite a few
            stupid-ass problems

            added verbose info for zone editing menu

            dikuEdit no longer saves rooms that contain nothing but followers,
            but the leader still needs to be written first

            zones are now initialized to valid values

            fixed follower bug

  7/24/96 - started adding basic shop stuff

            creating out of range mob vnum (loading) is allowed

            problem with editing room with mob/follower refs in mob list -
            it fucks it up, predictably enough

            when trying to delete/zero out .QST file, check that any quests
            even exist.  or some shit.  fuck, I dunno

  7/25/96 - fixed bug with mount/following stuff by not copying/deleting/
            restoring room mob lists while editing them.  May be some bugs
            with this in other commands, but I highly doubt it.

            fixed bugs with mobs and objs being decremented twice when
            dropping them etc

            quest file is now only zeroed out if it existed before but no
            quests exist anymore.  whee

            need to have edit quest menu allow delete command even if no
            messages or quest entries, so that you can delete quest

            yet another problem, picking up a mob and then dropping it
            while it's mounting mounted or following doesn't reset the
            pointers blah blah blah

            fixed problem by simply not allowing users to pick up mounted/
            mount-riding/following mobs

            fixed quest deletion prompts not popping up unless entries
            existed - thus, could not delete quest unless it had entries,
            and could not delete disappearance message without having
            mini-quest (or whatever the fuck) entries.  blah blah

            some wackyass problem with teacher - object loads on mobs
            on later mobs getting fucked, perhaps from picking them up
            and dropping them?  also, mount vnum got fucked somehow in
            Linux version, no idea how

            will fix Linux teacher bug later..  object loads were from
            old version of zon, apparently

            can now see mob misc info for mobs w/o descs

            released this version as 2.20

   8/3/96 - Yellowstone vacation..

            changed .QST file deletion so it respects the subdir setting

   8/4/96 - now supports bold bit correctly, fixed all the color code shit

            new zone numb and starting numb default to 1 instead of 0

            changed config menu a bit, fixed little bug that didn't check
            all settings to see if g_madeChanges needed to be set

            moved SWAPEXITS command before SWAPNS command instead of after
            (whoops)

            can now use "give <#> mob" for vnum you aren't carrying.  it's
            great.  still need to add the shit for equip, though - this
            also works for putting stuff in objs, btw

   8/5/96 - fixed up the "swap" command - wasn't displaying error messages
            for invalid args or for swapping an exit with itself

            Linux ver segfaulted after giving error about top room being
            incorrect - bah

            removed all the QQ crap - thank god

   8/6/96 - check command now writes errors to CHECK.LOG - will make toggleable
            soon

            limit field for objs/mobs is now 6 chars wide instead of 3

            can no longer hit Enter for opposite exit when creating rooms
            when you specified no exit to the room from the current room

            added toggle for CHECK.LOG

   8/7/96 - fixed minor bug with die string checking - allowed "XdY+"

            can now equip shit on mobs on the fly with vnums

            fixed up mob equipping - now reports where each piece of eq
            was equipped

   8/8/96 - fixed up grid creation so that the northwest corner is the
            lowest room vnum (more intuitive if ya ask me)

  8/10/96 - forgot to close quest file after reading it..  damn.  fixed

  8/11/96 - default zone number for "Zone number = 0" prompt is set to
            that of roomHead if .WLD file exists

  8/14/96 - can no longer copy descs from/to same room/mob, fixed error
            messages for a few modified commands

            somewhere between yesterday and 8/11, allowed objects without
            types to be considered containers for put commands in .ZON -
            caused crashes in Linux version (accessing NULL pointer) and
            should be added anyway

            some time ago...  mobs with quest/shop info now have Q/S shown
            next to their names as with other stuff..

            clone now puts room/obj/mob in first free vnum instead of highest
            + 1

            shops are now read 100% (assumedly) correctly

  8/16/96 - bug with grids - if x < y, it fucks up.  go figure.

  8/17/96 - fixed dumbass grid bug - popped up any time x != y..  blah.  I
            would say what the bug was, but it was far too stupid to document.

  8/18/96 - added LIQ_POISON type

            quests are now rewritten in numerical order

            fixed little bug that caused the exists: yes/no prompts to
            sometimes be incorrect (truncating a 4-byte pointer to one
            byte doesn't help much for accuracy)

            added "check zone flags" toggle/commandline switch

            can now stat mobs by keyword - mobs in current room are
            checked first

            can now stat objects by keyword - currently only checks for
            objects lying on the ground, not in containers or on mobs,
            otherwise is like stat mob

            shops are now written in their entirety, and correctly,
            too, I might add

  8/20/96 - changed hometown #2 to Ugta

            seem to be bugs with "where" and mobs..

            got rid of "strnSect" crap in inventory functions

            unequip wasn't updating g_madeChanges

  8/21/96 - added minimal shop editing stuff

            added "list shops" command

            made error messages when reading quests a bit more explicit

            fixed dumbass bug with goto command not matching objects and
            mobs properly

            changed the list room, mob, and obj functions so that they
            don't display a pause line at the end of the list (it was
            a pain in the ass)

  8/22/96 - changed default obj/mob short names (woowoo)

            added nice generic getRoomKeyword function to snag a room
            based on a keyword/vnum specification

            added "at" command, works like a charm

  8/23/96 - added shop buy/sell multiplier editing and message editing

            added shop opening/closing time editing

            don't allow user to pick up or drop copies of mobs with shops

            added shop roam/no magic/killable toggles

            added shop racism editing thingies, added shop race list to
            go along with it..

            added edit shop/delete shop commandline stuff

            shop sold list is now fully editable

            fixed bugs with deleting shops/quests from commandline
            and other wackiness with not updating pointers properly

            shop traded objtype list is now fully editable

            code now writes room number of first shop mob instance found

            code warns if no instance of shop mob found when writing
            file

            new shops are now initialized to valid values

            added renumber code for shop item lists

            released this version as 2.30

            1/0 now allowed as well as Y/N in that one bool function

  8/24/96 - object names in the quest quest editor are now trimmed

  8/25/96 - all mob values set by converter are in one submenu (basically
            just switched mob money and level)

            can now see what all a shop is selling by typing "list", much
            like dikuMud - also shows if shop is selling an item not in inv

            fixed dumbass bug with createObj/MobHere when creating obj/mob
            not in this zone and setting the limit..  blah blah

            fixed bugs with "all mobs in room are followers" code - wasn't
            aborting save properly and output was odd for some strange
            reason

            added code to check if shop has all objs in inventory and to
            check if shop is loaded while saving

            that code now works, added code to not allow user to load
            more than one of a particular shop

            fixed bug with writing room number as 0 when not finding a
            mob loaded for a shop..  though this shouldn't pop up anymore
            anyway, since mob existence is checked for before saving

            .ZON file is now checked for multiple loads of individual
            shops

            released this version as 2.31

            updated mountain dwarf and halfling hometown names

            "quest receive string" no longer has color codes removed from
            objects

  8/27/96 - fixed bug with writing extra % for shop opening/closing times
            somewhere - only popped up under Linux

            inventory items auto-added for shops now have limit set to 999

            changed shop letters before mob name from "S" to "Sh"

            only force two '%s's in buy/sell messages if they are buying/
            selling shit

  8/29/96 - quest reading code wasn't checking for invalid first letter
            when checking for R, G, etc in quest quest shit

            only one %s is forced now if shop isn't selling/buying anything

            when reading shit with fgets, need to check that entire string
            was read by checking for \n at the end of the string.  fun fun
            fun.

            added shitloads of input-checking to .OBJ file - should be
            bulletproof as it will ever be

            added error-checking for mob money string

            ride and follow commands now have if-flag field set to 1 - after
            all, if mob to follow/ride wasn't loaded..  etc

            all .MOB file input is checked with the same method as the .OBJ
            file

            would be nice to make sure all numeric args are numeric - I'll
            add it eventually, honest

            .WLD file is now checked in similar manner to .MOB and .OBJ..

            should add lookup tables that contain vnum and address for
            objects, mobs, etc - default size is 10000 each (80k per table),
            can be increased with commandline switch - need 3 tables, one
            for room, one for obj, one for mob - to get shop, quest pointers,
            just find mob numb and grab shop/quest pointer off of that

            readded "freestack" command - woowoo

  8/30/96 - added lookup table support for room creation and findRoom -
            alas, only made grid creation about twice as fast (took 13 seconds
            with Ugta on old version for 20x20, 7 seconds with new) when it
            should be nearly instantaneous - only solution I can think of
            for this is to use the diku approach of having vnums mapped to
            real numbs, a table for where vnums are mapped, and then go crazy.
            wouldn't require lookups, could keep track of highest real numb
            for rooms, mobs, etc to make adding quick and easy - real numb
            table would contain element of vnum array that contains vnum..
            hmm

            switched over to one one-dimensional array that contains room
            pointers, array element is actual vnum of room - grid creation is
            MUCH faster, such that it reports 0 seconds to finish 20x20..  it
            still seems to slow down when more rooms exist, which shouldn't
            happen..  at any rate, it looks like this is the way to go.
            current default is 100000 entries per table, or 1.2 megs for all
            three (big deal).  maybe even make it bigger..  2.4 megs isn't
            that much..  but anyway, it will of course be increasable from the
            commandline.

            added options to updateAllMandElists to only update when room has
            objs/mobs - sped things up a little, about the best I can do

            added scavenger indicator for mobs ("Sc")

            fixed room deletion so it updates lookup tables, clone now checks
            to see if we're going over the limit, as does room creation, fixed
            vnum changing in room menu

            for renumbering - easiest way would be to dupe the current table
            and just move everything over

            renumbering seems to work perfectly, I simply renumber as normal
            and rebuild room list..  whee.  also, only 1 is added to shift to
            fix bug with renumbering with same vnum as is in zone..  and of
            course limit is checked

            I think most of the holes for rooms have been plugged..

  8/31/96 - added lookup table for objs, still need to add it in a few more
            choice spots, but otherwise objs are in, baby

            bug in clone room - wasn't updating Last pointers properly -
            they were set to NULL, it seems, but may have caused problems when
            deleting rooms - should be entirely fixed, too lazy to check if
            last bugfix made last cloned room have Last pointer updated
            right - zzzzzzzz - it fixed it..  yay

            fixed bug that would've allowed you to exceed the limit by
            creating a grid

            added "check for missing keys (objs/exits)" option

   9/1/96 - add check for unloaded objects/mobs

            added afore-mentioned check, works like a charm

            second column indicators for room flag/sector editors were
            misplaced

            can now list a specific obj/mob by typing "list loaded <vnum>"

            added "list lookup" command - dumps lookup tables

            deleting the last mob or object now resets the lowest and highest
            obj/mob numb vars..  no need for rooms, since you can never delete
            the last one

   9/2/96 - added "info" command, disallowed /LL=0

            if object had no apply data for #1 but had apply data for #2,
            #2 wouldn't get written

   9/3/96 - createRoom, Obj, and Mob functions all take vnum args now, so as
            to update lookup tables properly - thus createedit and create with
            vnums now work properly

            need to reset highest and lowest if only one room/obj/mob and
            vnum is changed

            updated edit obj menu so it changes lookup entries if vnum is
            changed and aborted..  updated obj and room menus so that the
            references are re-renumbered back..  changed edit room menu so
            it resets low/high properly with one room

            rooms, objs, and mobs should all support lookup tables fully
            correctly (wink wink)

   9/4/96 - objects and mobs in inventory are now properly checked for and
            deleted when the corresponding type is deleted, and keywords are
            reset as necessary

            can no longer enter negative (non-numeric, to be more exact) values
            for item type or value of quests - also edited quest item menu a
            tad

   9/5/96 - since the Next pointer wasn't copied in questQuest nodes, the
            rest of the list would get hosed when editing one..  muahahah..
            I rock

            for some odd reason, finding a shop that wasn't loaded didn't
            abort saving properly..  bah

            shops with roam set are now saved with a room numb of 0 no
            matter what it's really set to (whoops)

            added check room command - checks for single file rooms that
            don't have two exits exactly, and for rooms without descs

   9/6/96 - added shop sell value-adjusted price listings to shop obj
            listings

            non-header zone lines are now checked for fgets not snagging
            the whole line - woowoo

   9/7/96 - errors due to improperly specified rooms, container objs, or
            mobs are no longer fatal

   9/8/96 - added extraneous key check

            added check for objects that are wearable but not takeable

            odd bug with kobold zone - keeps saying key #1460 is never used,
            even if 1460 is/isn't a key, does/doesn't exist, is/isn't used..
            bahh

            changed "dark" bit on extra flag for objs to buried, added
            buried indicator

            released as version 2.40

  9/10/96 - started adding nifty new function to see if a particular mob can
            equip a certain object..  it's mostly done

  9/12/96 - add "delete all unloaded obj/mob types" option

            check quests/shops when looking for loaded/used objs

  9/13/96 - added code to check for quests that give obj

            money string-generating function should now leave out coin
            values of 0

            updating a few menus and prompts here and there, just for
            the hell of it..  need to update all zone editing menus, as
            they currently don't properly support the verbose menus
            setting..  oh no

            update all flag menus to show flag value in parentheses
            after ";" option - do this regardless of verbose menu
            setting

  9/15/96 - fully made spiffy canEquip() function, is now used whenever
            equipping mobs - that is, when reading .ZON and when equipping
            mobs from commandline.  should work with wholebody/head shit,
            too - looks like it does, still need to fully test, though it
            looks like it works right

            added WEAR_WHOLEBODY/HEAD shit to dispmob.c

            somehow, forgot to add code to reset lowest/highest vnum when
            deleting rooms/objs/mobs..  still need to add it

            vnums aren't working in lookup

            added TWOHANDS shit where needed...  also, when equipping
            held/wielded/shield items, free hands are checked..  thus, it
            should be fully complete

            list mob command now recognizes vnums, obj and room will soon..

            shop sold list is now checked as well as quest shit for "is obj
            used" function

            added "delete unused" modifier to delete command, looks like
            it works like a charm

            added vnum lookup to objs and rooms

            low/high numbs are reset after deleting room/obj/mob types

            released this as 2.41

  9/16/96 - bleh, an earring was getting stuck in the right slot always,
            instead of the left slot

            forgot to check for "two hands" wear bit when checking if an
            object was usable but not takeable

  9/22/96 - values for 'H' and 'I' in checkconfig menu were backwards

            add guild room shit

  9/26/96 - added totem item type info and sphere info

            new zones now get a reset mode of "always" instead of "never"

 10/02/96 - added "edit obj" and "edit mob" loadtime modes (-o and -m)

 10/08/96 - fixed "lookup" command - was displaying equal shit at wrong
            times, for whatever reason

            fixed matching multiple thingies with lookup/list mob/room/obj

            expanded dest room and key numb fields for exits

            made spiffy sphere display for totems

            added trap affect support flag editing and display to objs

 10/09/96 - made spiffy trap affect display for traps - should add it for
            containers while I'm at it

 10/11/96 - fully added all trap editing

            updated affect/affect2/room flag/act flag editing menus

            added check for "check rooms" for twilight & dark set

            released this as version 2.50

 10/12/96 - added "unholy water" liquid type

 10/13/96 - no longer screws with argument list directly when checking
            command-line args

            added "dumptextcolor" command

            added check for rooms with no exits leading out of them

            bleh - objects with types not in the .obj were never
            equippable..  fixed code to be like it used to be - simply
            checks for eq already in that slot for objs w/ no type in
            zone

 10/14/96 - fixed bug with Linux version - screen was not always entirely
            cleared

            dikuEdit would report "unknown error" when equipping a two-
            handed weapon on a mob

 10/15/96 - fixed some nuttiness with equipping objects..  it seems to
            all be fixed, now

            mobs' equipment is now shown in the same order as diku eq

 10/16/96 - added new spelltypes

            added internal tables for room, obj wear, extra, mob act,
            aff1, and aff2 flags..  soon, easy-to-modify and add flag
            editing menus will be in (honest)

 10/19/96 - created "displayFlagMenu" function, it sorta kinda works.
            soon, all will be good.

            make command-line switch to only process door state commands
            in .zon and nothing else

 10/20/96 - the displayFlagMenu() func should now work correctly for all
            menus up to three columns.  I can always dream.

 10/22/96 - displayFlagMenu() should work mostly correctly now..  updated
            so it displays uneditable bits' letters as greyed

            interpEditFlags() function created - respects templates, editable
            flags, etc

            changed all templates so they just use a uint instead of a
            separate flag struct for each template type

            created editFlags() function

            updated all flag menus to use above functions

            added variable stuff for EDITUNEDITFLAGS var and command-line
            switch - still not recognized

 10/26/96 - shit to add for editable flag values - check for uneditable flags
            that are not set to default vals..  since all flags are now
            named, add setbit, which..  other neat shit.  make stat show
            actual flagnames

            if the default exit was deleted, the number of exits would increase
            by one.  gasp

            when loading default room, exits are no longer deleted

 10/29/96 - the EDITUNEDITFLAGS var has worked for a few days now..

            always show bits flagged as uneditable greyed, so that we know
            that it's supposed to be left alone

            check command now checks for uneditable bits that aren't set
            to default values..  too bad there's currently not enough room
            on the config menu to add the option

 10/30/96 - created getFlagsStrn() func - takes a flag val, array of flag
            info, pointer to string, creates readable string of flags

            added flag info to obj stats

            redo room info screen - it sucks

            can now see flag info for mobs

            created findFlag() function, should theoretically return the
            bitpos the flagname belongs to (-1 if none)

 11/01/96 - created which() function, checks rooms properly - need to update
            it so that if the flagname doesn't exist, it bitches

 11/02/96 - added "peppermint Schnappes" liquid type

 11/03/96 - can now always toggle flags that aren't set to the default

            added checks for mob class when equipping items

            changed noEqRestrict to eqRestrict, made it return error code

            updated canEquip to check error code from eqRestrict

            made errors for class/align restricts seperate

            take command now recognizes "all" properly, though it displays
            extra linefeeds out the ying

            extra LFs removed, looks like it works perfectly

            changed setVarArgs so it calls getArg() - probably made it
            considerably slower, but hell, life sucks

            "get all" and "get all <container/mob>" now both work fine

            changed "rent cost" to "condition" for objs, updated everything
            appropriately

            can now "drop all"

            can now "put/give all"

 11/04/96 - created getMatchingObj() function, takes a string, optional
            room, optional starting objHere (for room), and optional starting
            obj type.  basically checks if string is a vnum or keyword, then
            checks for object, looking in room first if non-null, then obj
            types.

            updated displayObjectInfo() to use getMatchingObj()

 11/07/96 - seems that occasionally the obj container vnum is not shown when
            listing a contained obj with the "where" command

            added "fixflags" command - sets all uneditable flags that don't
            have the default values to their default values.  it's handy.

            created getMatchingMob(), updated displayMobInfo()

 11/09/96 - accidentally changed ud-vision back to group..  fixed

 11/10/96 - right now, get/drop/put commands use vnums, which means that
            mobs may match the vnums when this is not intended.  need to add
            a method to force to try and take an obj.  probably something like
            "get o.bleh" or "get m.bleh" would work nicely

            add options to check for matching keys on both sides of doors,
            too

            add check for mobs that are following another that are not
            sentinel

            bleh, objects are always grabbed before mobs, no need to do that
            shit for "get all"

            user is now prompted if he wants to stick an unequippable obj in
            a mob's carried list on loadup

 11/11/96 - bleh, need to find good algorithm for checking flag existence
            based on what's being looked at..  bleh

            add command to find objs/doors that use a certain key - "key"
            would work

 11/13/96 - still going about damn "which" command wrong - need to break it
            up a tad more.  then, life would be good.

            new exits now get a dest of -1 instead of 0

 11/16/96 - can now abort creating a new room from second prompt as well as
            first one.  yay.

            the "s" is now added correctly to shit when displaying the number
            of entities saved in files

            fixed a few wayward "-ll" messages in crtroomu.c that were
            never updated

            need to add something but fuck me if I remember what

            need to replace all code that loops through global room/obj/mob
            lists to use getHighest..Numb() etc..  will help when multizone
            shit goes in (if)

            when an object is changed, check to see if it can no longer be
            equipped on any mobs it is currently equipped on

 11/17/96 - the which command semi-works..  it matches the extra flag on objs
            but nothing else.  fuck me if I know why.  I'll figure it out.
            honest.

            which command now works right for objects

            which now works for mobs, and even supports ! for not

            fixed bug with setting a variable with more than two words in
            the value..  whoops

            going to next/prev objs should now work correctly

 11/18/96 - checking equippability of edited eq now works correctly - still
            need to check after mobs are changed, though

            fixed bug that might've crashed while displaying sector
            edit menu if sector type was way out of range - should check
            sector type upon loading

            changes in mob class and alignment are now checked as well

            editing trap flags is now done from flag menu..  making the
            flag editing modular was very nice indeed.  I'm so proud

            going to next and previous mobs and rooms now works by number,
            instead of going blindly through the linked list

            you can now jump to a specific room/obj/mob from the editing
            menu by hitting the slash (/) key

            released this version as 2.60

 11/19/96 - added "trap level" - if three-arg trap info is found, trap
            level is set to object condition

 11/21/96 - to prevent stack overflows from moving around in room/obj/mob
            editing menus, return a pointer to the type being edited - if
            non-NULL, call the editing function again with the pointer

 11/24/96 - did above-mentioned fix for all editing menus, works like a
            charm

 12/01/96 - when cloning objects or mobs, the number loaded wasn't incremented
            must have been the sole bug-causer, as everything else looks right

 12/04/96 - changed code so that changing an object's wear/extra bits or
            mob's class/align should check object types properly ..  only
            problem now is that changing the location an obj is equipped in
            isn't detected.  simply add another check and prompt user to move
            eq to whatever slot shows up first

            mercs could use anything - whoops.  in the mud they can use
            anything that isn't anti-warrior and anti-thief.  neat eh.

 12/08/96 - fixed bug in obj-editing and mob-editing load modes (-o, -m).
            after changing so it doesn't eat up stack, forgot to update
            the loops here to continue looping.  fixed

 12/09/96 - added deleteObjectTypeinList() function - updated del unused
            to use it ..  will update others as appropriate

            if keyword list string for obj or mob is "$~", return obj/mob
            node right there..  end of file nuttiness

 12/10/96 - shop listing code is currently fucked - good ole' double >= 22 shit

            can now edit fear, sleep, aware bits in mob aff flags

 12/11/96 - created CHECKMOBCLASSEQ var - if set to TRUE, checks class flags,
            otherwise doesn't bother, just like good ole' Duris - default is
            FALSE

            added IGNOREZONES var - if TRUE, reads past 'S' lines in zone
            file - thus, EOF is assumed to be the end of the file

            the missing key check checks quests/shops as well as obj loaded
            (calls isObjTypeUsed)

            when deleting quest/shop/temp files (descs), first try unlink(),
            then try remove() if that fails

 12/12/96 - template arrays are now zero'd with memset() instead of a for
            loop.  yay

            g_madeChanges is set when setting a template.  yay

 12/15/96 - obj and mob pointers in obj/mobHere nodes are reset when changing
            obj/mob type vnum or creating a new obj/mob type.

            fixed keyword matching version of shop list

 12/16/96 - editing an object value field can now bring up a flag menu not
            unlike those for obj wear flags etc..  implemented it for container
            flags, coming for totem flags oh so soon

            can now edit totem flags via flag menu

            colorized trap effect shit for easier recognition

 12/17/96 - resetting wear flags is now checked for

            added "echoIt" var to all equipMob functions ..  hopefully can
            now use em to equip shit silently

 12/27/96 - .set file wasn't being closed after being read

            scanObjHereListForLoadedContainer() didn't return TRUE when
            finding a loaded container inside a container..  apparently
            this bug has been there forever.  whee

            added "getShowPricesAdjusted" var - if set to TRUE, multiplies
            item cost by sell multiplier, if FALSE, it doesn't (booleans is
            amazin)

 12/31/96 - removed memory leaks from objtypes.c stuff

            removed memory leak from roomtype.c getSectorTypeStrn() func

            fixed memory leaks in command\look.c ..  still quite a few
            in inventory crap, though

            adjusted name trimming lengths for special obj value flag
            menus

            fixed up obj-only and mob-only editing modes and added
            room-only mode

            added "material type" info and help for val3 fields of WORN/
            ARMOR items

   1/2/97 - updated hometown info

  1/10/97 - moved objectHere info to objhere.h and mobHere rec info to
            mobhere.h

  1/11/97 - "at" command now checks room names as well as obj/mob names for
            room location ..

  1/12/97 - config.c editing function now uses copyVarList and compareVarList
            functions

            updated editchck.c with copyVarList/compareVarList jolliness

  1/13/97 - updated editdisp.c with same shit as above

            released this shit as 2.70

            obj editing menu that shows obj worth now also shows it as
            a money string next to the copper value

            made "exits" command more modular and efficient

            created displayContainerContents function, made both look
            functions that can display container contents call it

            hidden, invis, buried, magic objects all have appropriate
            duris-like words shown after em in containers

            added material type check for objects of type worn (11)/armor (9)

            started adding multiple menu shit for checking

  1/14/97 - hmm, compareExtraDescs ain't quite accurate

            fixed bug in getMoneyStrn that got rid of ", " at the end
            of the string improperly..

  1/16/97 - split up all the check menus properly, added missing options to
            check and config menus

            added %1,%2,%3 etc arg support to aliases (hey, even %0!)

  1/17/97 - added var dereferencing support to aliases ($varname)

  1/21/97 - added semicolon support (parses as if semicolon was an enter..)
            sorta works

  1/26/97 - parsing with semicolons now works right, as does the long
            command-line prompt and command history

  2/04/97 - changed ITEM_STONE to ITEM_VEHICLE

  2/09/97 - added new sector types

            added 'zoneexits' command - shows exits that lead out of zone

            released this as 2.80

  2/11/97 - an exit of '-1' is out of zone

  3/04/97 - sometime between now and then - if an object is twohands and
            the canWear function thingy sez they can't use it, it's probably
            because ..  bleh, other hand shit is fucked too.  bah!  anyway..
            hey..  good idea is to move eq list temporarily to something
            else..  just set eq pointer to NULL..  whee.  will do.  honest.

            added error-checking to addObjHeretoList/deleteObjHerefromList
            functions

            set objToAdd's Next pointer to NULL after adding to list in
            addObjHeretoList

            fixed dumbass bug with aliases not taking arguments right (when
            they had no %blah args)

            added nifty "verbose" modes for lists

            started adding stuff for searching for field values by substring -
            spell names, commands, room names, object names

  3/06/97 - added search commands, mostly works - I lied, it completely
            works

            okay - way to fix eq thing for good is to simply remove eq before
            checking if mob can use it

  3/11/97 - changed equipment linked list over to array - still need to test

            looks like it all works..  it died once when looking at the
            skeleton in nakral's room, but seemed to fix itself when I added
            some range checking.  odd.

            bug with checking if eq can be worn (based on slot being
            full and simple "can usedness") should now work

            array that held equipment data was one element too small.  DOH!

            fixed some other minor oversights here and there

  3/12/97 - added code to take ansi codes into account when trimming title
            names

  3/14/97 - everything that supports "mob" as an arg should now support "char"
            as a substitute

  3/20/97 - fixed wacky room flag display with kludge - added flags for
            rooms, btw

            released this as 2.81

  4/03/97 - started making changes to displayFlagMenu so that it's truly
            general case (or as much as possible) - should get rid of wacky
            bugs

            g_listCommands func should now show three commands per line

  4/07/97 - fixed up displayFlagMenu so it mostly works.  a few little
            things to fix yet..

  4/09/97 - displayFlagMenu and related brethren now work perfectly

            removed anti-warrior etc flags in obj extra struct

            (whenever) added two new flags to objects, extra2 and anti.
            can edit em, read em, save em.  it works.

            slap "set/" at the start of filename if read from dirs is
            enabled

            added extra2/anti-flag recognition to which

            added extra2/anti-flag info to obj stat screen

            unequipping shit from changing anti flag seems to work well
            enough.  eqRestrict() doesn't check races yet, but hell who cares

            added "const" keywords in various places (a while back, mostly
            flag display, menu stuff).  someday I will add em everywhere
            they belong.

  4/11/97 - "unalias" is now required to unalias an alias.  typing "alias
            aliasname" shows what it's aliased to

            ditto for "unset"/"set"

            released this as 2.82

  4/14/97 - removed some unneeded .h files (related to flag-editing) and a
            few unneeded #includes of these files..  woowoo, it should speed
            up compiling by at least..  200 milliseconds!

  4/22/97 - updating readzone and writezone stuff to no longer read/write
            weather info, etc..  reads old-style zones, writes all zones as
            new format

            new read/writezone stuff should work, and indeed, to the best of
            my knowledge, it does

            modified zone menus, zone stat, default vals for new zones, zone
            record (duh) for new zone info

            released this as 2.89 (non-public release for Duris use)

  4/25/97 - added 'setrand' command - it works

            whoops, new obj/mobheres now get 100% random chance

            show 100% in rooms for mobs/objs

            every piece o code that shows a mob/obj should now also show
            the random chance to load

  4/27/97 - added nifty 'key' command - shows where (if) a key is used

  4/30/97 - added beholder race type - woo

  5/08/97 - added new flags to extra2 flag

            added new info for missile weapons, quivers, missiles themselves

  5/10/97 - added "fixcond" command, sets all objects with conditions less
            than 100 to 100

  5/13/97 - toggle the correct variable for 'show exit dests of -1' in
            config menu

            show obj name/number in key list, allow objects with no type,
            allow people to look for keys with no object list

            fix the func that shows out-of-zone exits so it respects var

            added new race types, spell types

            released this as 2.89b

  5/21/97 - added check for mob quests with no actual quest info (messages
            or quest stuff) and shops that aren't selling/buying anything,
            moved checks for exit, mob, obj, room descs to start so that
            they spam the start instead of the end (where all the important
            errors are)

            fixed bug that caused objectHeres created by the function that
            doesn't stick it in the room automatically to have a random
            chance of 0%.  I'd venture that this only caused a problem for
            equipping mobs on the fly

  5/26/97 - equipping a mob with a second held object was allowed, but
            would replace original held object.  fixed

            changed canEquip functions' names so that they're more
            clear

            fixed more wackiness with equipping/giving objects to mobs -
            I wasn't calling the standard functions when creating objHeres.
            tsk tsk

  5/28/97 - made a few key functions inline - fixQuestRecvString (woo), and
            all the stuff in vardef.c..  made the exe a bit bigger and
            ever-so-much-more-efficient.

            changed shop messages so that they are semi-grammatically
            correct by default

  5/30/97 - added anti2 flag struct to object types, anti2 flag defs, anti2
            flag editing func, ability to edit from obj menu, added to
            "which", added new wear flags for horn, tail, etc, added
            read/write stuff to read/writeObject (read will read a 5-arg
            string, leaving anti2 at 0), compare anti2 flags on two objs..

            still need to add new position crap for horn etc etc etc

            down arrow history stuff was never updated for wide fields
            like up arrow stuff was.  ancient bug, baby

            in displayFlagMenu(), check if numbCols is too small to
            display everything without going over the line limit in
            MAX_FLAGS_Y (or whatever it is) and reset it to number
            required if it is

            fixed wacky little bug that displayed contents of LASTCOMMAND
            when you hit enter at main prompt - popped up because addVar
            used to delete var if there was no value for the var to
            contain..  now, it displays value instead.  bug was simply
            never noticed before..

            fix bug that only crashed de under linux where canMobTypeEquip()
            was getting passed NULL objPtrs..  this was a fairly serious
            bug, but it should only pop up when objs with no types are
            being equipped on mobs..  now it seems to kill the damn editor
            any time you edit extra/extra2/anti/anti2/wear flags etc etc..
            yet another bug perhaps

  6/01/97 - note to self: if using 'where' command, check quests/shops

  6/04/97 - heh, hold was being checked for twice in getMobHereEquipSlot
            (used to be named canMobHereEquip)

  6/07/97 - added species stuff for githyanki and minotaur

            add special checking crap for guildhalls

            add mass setbit options

            uhh I think that's it..  check for no_ground rooms with no
            down exit..  rooms with a fall %age but no down exit...
            shit like that

  6/08/97 - added fall percentage/noground room checks

            added CHECKGUILDSTUFF var and funcs, added checking for
            mobs with aggro/hunter bits and objects that are noshow

  6/09/97 - started adding crap for special race slot handling and new slot
            shit blah blah damn it's fun

            changed mob race editing crap so it does the same sort of
            shit that the alignment code does..  DAMN THIS IS FUN!

            equipping crap for thri-kreen etc etc works 99.9% now

            fixed bug with unequipMobSpecific() that seemed to stem
            from the fact that watcom assumed a var of type char was
            unsigned..  perhaps a string was declared on the same line?
            whatever, tis fixed now, and gcc doesn't have that problem,
            for that matter.  CURIOUS!

            added 93.4% of the stuff needed for new exits (northwest,
            etc)

            exit stuff is now 97.6% complete

            exit stuff is now 99.9999% complete

            added "mass set" command, does what the old "setbit" util used
            to

            added prompts for zone name and "is this a guild?" prompt when
            creating a new zone

            set guild var automagically based on a couple of things

            released this as version 2.90

  6/11/97 - if checking guild stuff, now checks for teleporters with keyword
            not equal to "enter"

            added anti-race/sex checking based on anti/anti2 bits...  added
            check variables for each, default false

            whoops, forgot to update "check flags" function to check
            new object fields (extra2, anti, anti2).  really only matters
            for extra2 but hey there ya go

            check for all nonsensical combinations of light flags in rooms
            (nonsensical being any two light-related flags..)

            changed isObjTypeUsed to take a vnum instead of an object
            pointer so that it will check for objects not in the zone
            properly (when checking shops and quests)..

            added check for rooms with heal and noheal flags set (shrug)

            updated "object has wear bits but no take flag" code for new
            wear flags galore

  6/12/97 - fixed extremely old bug - LOCK bit in obj extra flag was
            long ago changed to NOSELL (like in 1994 or so.. heh)..
            so I fixed

  6/16/97 - got rid of TOTEM.H in obj/ dir - old-ass crap

            fixed some bugs with setting g_madeChanges (mostly with
            setVarBoolean stuff [in setting aff/aff2 edit flag and a
            few other minor places] and the biggest offender,
            setLimitArgs [was always setting g_madeChanges if a setlimit
            command was in a .set file])

            added "default" vars to rooms, objects, and mobs - var is
            set to TRUE for default rooms, objects, and mobs, predictably
            enough..  doesn't allow vnum changes on default entities, and
            don't update low/high limits and other stuff..  fixes a few
            bugs

            replaced magic numbers for jumping around entities with
            actual defines (misc/menu.h)

            removed default args from a few choice places, since they're
            99.44% evil

  6/17/97 - made a few more things const and removed a few more default
            args

            can now use "jump" keys for quests - looks like it works

            added check for mobHeres with types that are following other
            mobs and don't have their sentinel bit set

            added "&n"s to the start of titles for room, obj, mob,
            zone, quest, and shop editing menus - if the user defines
            a prompt and doesn't stick an "&n" at the end, it makes the
            title bold for at least a little bit - only needed because
            of "jump" stuff, so not really needed for zones just yet

  6/18/97 - updated shop editing menu so you can jump around

            now adds '&n' to the end of the menu and main prompt if user
            forgot to add it - creates all kinds of wacky color problems
            if user forgets to reset bold bit

            put B and C options on obj editing menu on one line (short/
            long name)

            can now hit ? or $ to display/search through list of whatevers
            when jumping on room/obj/mob/quest/shop menus

            added check for rooms with underwater bit set but no
            underwater sector type or vice versa

            added check for objects with ALLOW_ALL flag set, but other
            anti/anti2 flags set (ALLOW_ALL overrides all anti/anti2 flags)

            made quite a few simple exit functions inline to speed whatever
            calls em up a little

            whoops, forgot to check for '&n' in durisANSIcode

            can now use '&=<background><foreground>' in dikuedit
            properly - not entirely proper but mostly works

            whoops - added new exit numbs to displayDirectionList()

            whoops - added checks for new exits in showKeyUsed() - exits
            should really be in an array..  someday

            doh..  never initialized old alias pointer in unaliasCmd,
            so that removing the head alias would more than likely be
            fatal

            internal changes - made various flag arrays and other vars
            related to displayFlagMenu() uchars instead of chars and
            made all the alias args take a pointer to the alias list to
            change instead of assuming global list

            doh..  same thing with unaliasCmd above existed with
            unvarCmd..  also made unvarCmd and setVarCmd take a pointer
            to head of the variable list

            fixed bug with not setting new node's Next pointer to NULL
            in copyVarList().  luckily this doesn't really matter
            (since the entire node was copied over), but hey, might
            as well be 100% proper.

            missed yet more new exit stuff with cloneRoom and deleting
            exits in cloned rooms..  doh

            enabled pentium-specific optimizations, disabled stack
            overflow checking, am now using reorder instructions and "optimize
            for time" optimization options

  6/19/97 - switched room exits info over to array

            forgot to update checkAndFixRefstoObj() with new exit types
            for key checking - heh

            yet another place where new exit types weren't updated -
            when deleting exits in copyDefaultExecCommand()

            forgot to check for new exit types in startInit() where keys
            are checked for..

            never updated displayRoomInfo() for new exit stuff - but
            function is too wacky to easily fix, so just comment out exit
            stuff entirely - will redo function soon anyway..

            never updated one version of createRoomExit() for new exit
            types

            deleteExitPromptPrompt wasn't updated to uint for exitAvail
            instead of uchar - doh

            looks like switchover worked..  still some stuff that could
            be optimized but on the whole several chunks of code became
            more efficient and easier to read - woohoo!  -as a side note,
            the EXE became about 12k smaller..  wow.

  6/20/97 - changed deleteExitPrompt() and exit stuff in copyDefaultExecCommand
            to use new func getDirfromKeywords(), making it more modular
            and efficient etc etc

            added /j option to default compile options so that a type
            of "char" defaults to signed..  GASP!  WHAT A NOVEL CONCEPT!

            whoops, forgot to update g_madeChanges when an exit is copied
            into the default

            got rid of a few needless #includes, making compile-time
            a wee bit faster.  woohoo!

            remColorCodes() func didn't always make sure end string was
            'capped' with a NULL..  might be bad

            made func that checks guild teleporters for 'enter' check
            for 'touch' too, like it was supposed to

  6/21/97 - updated durisANSIcode to check for &=xy..  oops

            hmm..  apparently _outtext doesn't output a linefeed if the
            string is exactly 80 characters long..  what to do what to do

            insertChar's temporary string was always 256 bytes long...
            this would have caused problems, but luckily insertChar is
            currently only called from getStrn..  at any rate, the temp
            string is now allocated to strlen(strn) + 2

            whoops, never updated displayRoomFlagsandSector to display
            new room flags (past twilight)

            added inroom indicators for floatable, transient objects

            added inroom indicators for mobs with memory, protector,
            and aggr to outcast flags set

            created functions getScreenHeight(), getScreenWidth(),
            numbLinesStringNeeds() to make dynamic height/width stuff
            work..  screen height and width are user vars that default
            to 25 and 80 (respectively)

            added indicators for mobs with hunter, aggr evil/good race,
            stay in zone bits set..

            added "height" and "width" commands, which just call varCmd()
            or display default if var doesn't exist for now...  I will
            make them real commands someday, maybe

            added options to config menu to edit screen height and width

            updated deshort.hlp - was missing quite a few commands

            also updated de.doc for new vars..  still need to update
            it for a few commands, I'd suspect

            numbLinesStringNeeds() was reporting that a line with only
            a linefeed (no valid characters) took 0 lines..  whoops

            added a check for objects with nothing in their anti
            flag set

            room names now have trailing spaces trimmed, and obj/mob
            short/long names have leading and trailing spaces trimmed..

            fixStringNodes func now takes arg that controls whether or
            not leading blank lines are removed (leading blank lines
            are removed for exit, room, and mob descs)

            leading/trailing spaces are now trimmed after input for
            the previously mentioned short/long names etc also

            should add check options for rooms with no name, objects
            with no short/long name, etc

  6/22/97 - changed randomChance in objHere and mobHere records from a
            char to an unsigned long..  might help with sprintfs

            made end string lengths when writing out various zone commands
            longer, since they weren't really long enough before..

            never added stuff so mobs can wear WEAR_BACK - whoops.  also
            made the check for the hold bits last, so that other slots
            get worn first

            changed anti flag check so it checks only the bits that set
            usable status

            removed some unneeded checks from equip, unequip, give, put,
            take and drop functions

            updated DE.DOC for new commands

            added check for objects loading into no ground rooms and
            non-floating objects loading into water rooms

            updated look() function to use getDirfromKeyword

            yet more const keyword additions

  6/23/97 - added checks for rooms with no names, objects with no short
            or long names, and mobs with no short names (no long name is
            valid for mobs)

            added stuff for "save every X commands"...  it works though
            is a tad annoying, but hey

            outtextstrn was a mere 256 bytes in displayColorString -
            could have led to problems if we had a string with no color
            changes for a while..  it's now dynamically allocated

            finally changed 'edit room sector' menu so it shows the
            swamp sector type in the right place..  should just make a
            function for this type of menu or hack around it with a
            flag def

            added yet more quest checking options under mob checking..
            now checks for quest messages with no keywords or actual
            message, and 'quest quests' for quests with no response to
            finishing or list of crap PCs need to give to the mob (mobs
            don't always have to give something back to the PC, the
            mob could just say some helpful information or some happy
            horseshit)

  6/25/97 - changed config menu so values of zero aren't allowed for
            screen height or width (cause division by zero errors)

            changed addVar to check if the variable being added/changed
            is screen height or width and the value being set is 0 -
            returns new errorcode VAR_CANNOT_BE_ZERO

            changed getVarNumb() to return the default value if the
            value the var is set to is non-numeric

            added fixGuildStuff() function - sets object noshow and
            mob aggro/hunter bits to zero if any objs/mobs have em

            added heading to mob misc #3 menu since people seemed
            to be setting the values..

            can no longer set flags with default values of 0 from
            the "enter direct value" prompt..  but alas flags with
            default values of 1 do get reset.  bah.

            yay - all the crap with "direct" flag entry is now fixed

            seems there was a small memory leak - colXpos and colTopFlag
            arrays are now always freed when done editing flags..  not
            sure why it was commented out

            released this as version 2.95

  6/26/97 - made check for objects with no 'allow' flags in the anti
            bitvector only check objects with 'take' flag set in wear
            vector - cuts down on spam

            whoops - updated preEditExit() and createEditExit() for
            getDirfromKeyword()..  made EXE a bit smaller still

            whoops again - when copying stuff into defaults, forgot
            to set g_defaultRoom etc variables..  also forgot to set
            default's vnum to 0, though this isn't really a big deal

            now checks for objects with conditions less than or equal
            to 0, values of 0 (for takeable objs), or trap values out
            of range (if a trap exists) - thus, everything in objects
            should now be checked (except for silly flag settings and
            type-specific stuff)

  6/30/97 - made strings used when writing zone commands the proper
            sizes once and for all - the 'comment' strings weren't long
            enough for the longest object and mob short names, and all
            of the strings used magic numbers for lengths..  no longer

            added object apply checking - checks for APPLY_NONEs with
            a non-zero modifier, valid apply locations with no modifier
            (except fire prot), and out-of-range apply locations

            added object type-specific value checking - looks like the
            basics work just dandy

            made default value of 'check exit desc' variable false

            code that checks container's keys to see if they're loaded
            was never updated to check quests and shops as well...
            whoops

            field for editing object type was only two characters and so
            wouldn't be editable if someone put in -1 (var is unsigned)

            added variable to getObjValueStrn() that determines whether
            extra info in square brackets is shown

            added check for transient objects loading onto ground
            in room

   7/1/97 - field for apply location was not wide enough if you entered
            a negative number yadda yadda

            made field for mob class three wide for same reason

            removed code that caused de to die if an out-of-range class
            was read in .MOB file

            fixed die-string validity code to make sure numbers actually
            exist between the start and 'd' and 'd' and +

            all non-flag stuff is now checked in rooms, mobs, and objects
            for out-of-rangeness and general validity

            long 'produced item' lists for shops went past array
            boundaries..  whoops

            changed scanKeyword to no longer require pos arg, changed
            checkEditable/MasterList and scanEntireObjectHereList
            functions..  everything works dandy

   7/7/97 - fixed resetEntityPointersByNumb - wasn't rebuilding master/
            editable lists in rooms after reassigning types based on vnum -
            also should be a bit faster now

            also moved code that checks for items of a certain type inside
            an item to before object is deleted in deleteAllObjHereofTypeInList -
            this doesn't always crash under DOS but it's gotta be fatal under
            Linux

            changed getObjTrapAffStrn() to copy 'none' into strn and return
            that instead of string literal..  can't hurt

            check for mob level isn't done if mob has '_ignore_' as one
            of its keywords

            added check for invalid item types in shop's 'traded' list

            added 'linkrooms' command - you specify the two rooms to
            create an exit between (optionally leaving out the first
            room arg [current room is assumed]) - it's handy

   7/8/97 - made code in findCorrespondingExit just check the one room
            that is passed to it - checking the entire room list is just
            silly.  dunno why I didn't spot this before..

            defined EXIT_ALL_EXITS_FLAG, used in the two places it's used
            instead of a magic number

            cleaned up and added comments to various source files (all
            in room/ dir so far)

            whoops, forgot to check for extraDescHead in updateAllMandElists() -
            might have caused some nuttiness here and there - but it didn't -
            in fact, that func was only called from purge, which can now
            just call the separate updates for objs and mobs, so it's commented
            out now

            although dikuEdit theoretically prevents rooms from having
            a vnum of 0, changed roomHasAllFollowers to return -1 if no
            rooms have followers, instead of 0

            room names now have ansi codes removed when looking for them
            in gotoRoomKeyword() - can't hurt

            found error in equipMobSpecific that would cause the loaded
            amount for an object loaded on the fly by vnum to increase
            before checking if object could be equipped.  whoops.

            changed race checking for items being equipped in the
            WEAR_BODY slot - if the object has the 'whole body' bit set,
            don't allow minotaurs and centaurs to wear

            deleting mobHere if mob has a shop ...  should work

            created removeObjHerefromList, just removes objHere from list,
            doesn't delete it

            changed equipEquiponMob to add the actual pointer passed to
            the equipment list instead of a copy

            changed various funcs in inv/equip.c for new technique

            heh.......  the various deleteObjHere functions didn't update
            the prompt, causing all kinds of wacky things to appear to
            happen

            ditto with various mob creation/deletion functions..

            changed createObject/MobTypeUser to return -1 on error instead
            of 0 and modified stuff in command/misccomm.c accordingly

            changed unequip to bounce objHere pointer around instead of
            needlessly copying it and deleting old one

            addObj/MobHeretoList now always sets Next pointer of added
            node to NULL - addMob never did and addObj didn't when new
            node was set to head of list

            create(edit) obj/mob commands don't tell you why they fail
            if you've hit the vnum limit - should theoretically change
            so it tells you why you can't..

   7/9/97 - createObject/MobTypeUser funcs now spit out an error message
            if createObject/MobType returned a NULL pointer

            changed copyObjHereList() to also increment g_numbObjs var
            and update prompt if incLoaded is TRUE..  pretty sure this
            is necessary

            hmm...  where command will report items in objects mobs
            are equipping, but not report that they are equipped by
            the mob - ditto with carried objects

  7/10/97 - altered checkDeleteMobsofType() to only check and not delete
            certain lists..  it's only called from one place

            fixed more crap and improper use of strings etc..  made
            checkCommands() take a command-processing function with a
            constant args string, fixed the last few wacky functions
            called by execCommands funcs..

            allow room vnums of 0 when loading..

            created getNumbFollowers(), added display of how many mobs
            are following a mob to displayRoom()

  7/11/97 - updated object struct for material and size and updated
            reading/writing stuff

            commented out display of mob follower amounts..  it looks
            crappy

  7/15/97 - added space to objects and reordered order material, space,
            and size are read in for mud

            read/write space to object files

  7/16/97 - can now edit space, get help on space and size

            updated compareObjectType for space, size, and material

            everything for materials etc should be in now..

            added new spell types, took out old val3 WORN/ARMOR material
            stuff..

            old object files are autoconverted to new format, with
            material converted over as closely as possible and size
            set to medium

            removed material checks for armor/worn, changed to check
            all objects

            added check for object size

            released this as version 2.96

  7/20/97 - added stuff to edit "id" edescs for objects

            changed createExtraDesc() to return a pointer to the newly
            created desc

  7/21/97 - added checking on .OBJ loading for objects with ident
            extra descs but no _ID_ keyword

            created getEdescinList(), gets an extra desc based on a
            keyword

            created getNumbStringNodes(), does what you'd think

            added checks (to 'check' command) for objects with ident
            edescs but no _ID_ keyword and ident extra descs themselves
            for the incorrect number of lines in their description

  7/23/97 - added max SP, enchantment level, and craftsmanship vars to
            objects and appropriate places, menus, etc

            added new material types

  7/24/97 - fixed stupid-ass bug in linkRooms that I must have introduced
            while I was on crack

            added new flags to extra2 bitvector (related to combat)

  7/25/97 - added z-coord stuff to grid creation

  7/31/97 - changed object enchantment to magical damage resistance, changed
            a few places to reference 'object condition' properly..  added
            yet more flags to extra2

            added stuff for ITEM_SHIELD type and vals0-3..  hmm that's it

            got rid of 'max SP' variable from object files..  it doesn't need
            to be read from object files since it'll always be set when the
            obj loads into the mud (convertObj)

   8/1/97 - added stuff for new weapon types, bunch of armor stuff in
            ARMOR.H..

            changed ident edesc editing to go straight to editing
            description

   8/2/97 - created objSpecialValEditRedundant to facilitate new flag
            stuff for armor

            added stuff for ARMOR and WORN items for exact armor positions
            and where armor is mainly worn

            changed 'magical damage resistance bonus' to just plain
            'damage resistance bonus'..  bit less confusing and after all
            an item could start with an innate resistance bonus, just as,
            well, a bonus

            got rid of 'enchanted against pierce/bludg/slash' in extra2,
            updated structs in objbits.h for new extra2 flags

            created info for horse body armor locations, updated everywhere
            appropriately

            added 'levitates' flag to obj extra bitvect, for purposes of
            objects that don't fall due to gravity (separate from float)

            added checks for wear bits vs. wear location (for armor/worn)
            and for new armor/worn vals

            removed 'armor class' as val0 for armor

            added diagonal creation options to grid creation

   8/3/97 - added armor type info (val3) for items of type armor

            moved armor type to val0 and made val3 armor thickness (a
            nice generic value with no specific meaning that can
            nonetheless differentiate between a thick breastplate and a
            thin one)

            added checks for all of armor stuff

            moved materials around (will probably require a reconvert
            of items..  which will be needed anyway, so no big deal),
            added a few new ones - removed leather/studded leather/padded
            leather as materials, since those are armor types

   8/6/97 - #defined and added new commands for renumbering just room,
            obj, or mob lists

            fixed bug with the 'setzonenumb' command not outputting
            anything if the zone number was equal to 0 - hot damn, good
            thing I picked up on this one

  8/18/97 - made flag indicator updating more efficient in various
            ways..

            made seperate commands for renumbering rooms, objects, and
            mobs and fixed lame-ass bug in 'renumber' command with no
            args (would always try to renumber objects and mobs, even if
            none existed)

  8/20/97 - made quivers wearable by mobs - must have forgotten to

            (earlier) added anti2 bits for aquaelf and sahaugin

            added yet more material types

            added weapon types

            made 'fixguildstuff' command reset non-neutral mobs' align

            released this as 2.97a

  8/21/97 - added more material types

            need to fix edesc deletion - broken for at least objects

            fixed dumbass bug in object edesc deletion

  8/24/97 - added NO_PARALYZE flag to mob action flag

  8/28/97 - added four new values to object types, changed object editing
            menu, reading, writing appropriately

            made val[4] specify weapons' poison type

            no longer check val[3] of item_container..

  8/29/97 - made val[4] of shields thickness, val[5] misc flags (just spiked
            for now)

            made val[4] of armor misc armor flags

            added 'pause every screenful of check errors' option with a
            little code magic

            fixed stupid bug that would cause checkObjectValue to spam an
            error if the file pointer was NULL.  duh.

            should add a help screen that pops up when you type de -? or
            de with no args (help screen that shows available args that is)

            released this as 2.97b

  10/1/97 - made 'massset' command not allow you to set non-editable flags
            unless that crazy 'edituneditable' var is set

  11/1/97 - did a bunch of crap lately..  compiled as a Windows95 console app..
            alas having some problems with it screwing up on colors when the
            line is on the very bottom of the console.  go figure.

            also fixed some bugs, namely the 'create object' bug (probably only
            shows up under Linux), the bug with input on the main prompt being too
            long (should show up in one way or another under DOS), a bug in where
            that wouldn't search for mobs by vnum..

  11/8/97 - converted all the source files over for file-by-file compilation..
            should make things much faster when just changing a small bit of
            code - alas running into problems galore with MS VC++ 4.1 -
            didn't recognize external inline functions, and now not recognizing
            external const arrays.  wow, VC rocks.

            changed code in init.cpp a bit to be a little faster, also
            commented out guildhall crap

 11/18/97 - now compiles under VC and Watcom - had various problems..  still
            not sure what's up with const crap though

 11/20/97 - finally added code for Win32 version of clrline()

            cleaned up code by removing old .C file #includes and other misc crap

            made some optimizations in flag-display stuff since Windows console apps
            are so damn slow at retrieving the cursor position

            about const - looks like arrays/user-defined records can't be
            declared as const and accessed externally..  I can kind of
            understand why, but it still seems like a rather strange C++
            language oversight (feature?)

            added 'cannot be summoned' flag to NPC act struct a while
            back, too..

            val[4] of potions now specifies how much damage you take from drinking
            them

   1/2/98 - added +max str, +race str crap to apply list

            added biofeedback bit to aff1 struct in appropriate places

            also added AFF3_ and AFF4_ stuff to mobbits.h, will add it to flagdef.cpp
            when they are user accessable someplace

            cleaned up races - half-orc was in there, but not really, and orc was in
            twice..  nutty eh

            fixed bug that prevented you from seeing the contents of an alias by typing
            'alias <aliasname>'..  wonder how long this has been there

            released this as 2.97c

   1/3/98 - copied map code from Duris source, adapted for dikuEdit, added some checking,
            and voila, we have maps displaying exactly like they do on Duris

            released this as 2.97d

   1/4/98 - whoops, checkObjArmor... (something like that) was saying that
            a NULL file pointer was an error..  doh.

            forgot to add entry for wax to getMaterialStrn

   1/8/98 - greatly sped up map display

  1/10/98 - added checks for mobs not standing that were aggro or casters

            made 'unused' bit in room flag 'no psionics'

  1/11/98 - added 'checkmap' command, checks n/w/s/e exits for mapliness

  2/10/98 - added new race (dracolich), new spells, and 'list exit' command

            released this as 2.97e

  2/13/98 - added new flag (not bashable) to mobs

  3/29/98 - added 'pearl' material

            removed armor class from armor and the APPLY_AC apply..
            switched over to armor type

  7/15/98 - over last few days -

            reenabled armor class stuff, disabled specifically new
            combat-related stuff (i.e. left thickness for armor, but
            took out 'coverage locations' and 'main wear location')

            added some new races

            updated anti2 and extra2 bitvect info, and trap types/bitvect

            source should now compile cleanly on any unix platform
            with ncurses provided -D__UNIX__ is specified when
            compiling

            updated version to 2.98

  6/02/99 - fixed some crap, APPLY_AC wasn't entirely reenabled

  6/03/99 - at some point added slime race

            released this to new duris i believe..

  6/08/99 - added 'ignore' shit to zoneexits command

  8/01/99 - updated flag info in object.h, mob.h, flagdef.cpp

  8/04/99 - fixed lame-ass bug that uppercased all var values read from
            .SET files

            added aff3/4 checks to check command

            changed stat room to fit stat obj/mob, now shows a bit more info
            but less in some senses.  OH WELL

            added aff3/4 crap to which, massset, maybe other crap

            updated 'key' command to check for both items of type 'key' and
            items with the keyword 'key' if no arg is specified

            released this as 2.98b

  8/23/99 - if zone flag of room not equal to zone flag of zone at startup,
            only warn about one room and don't echo the rest

            added skill grant/add applies, new spell types

            created skills.h, added all skills to objtypes.cpp

            updated spells.h and getSpellType...

            added applyWhere2 to apply struct for skill stuff

 10/04/99 - now compiled with Watcom 11.0, exe got bigger, but perhaps it
            is faster, or something

 10/05/99 - added support for mob size reading/writing in .mob file/editing,
            fixed incorrect 'non-info' obj/mob menu aff flag listings

            heh was checking if species string was too long, but string was
            read directly into already-'max sized' mob var..  now read into
            512-byte 'tempstrn' var first

            check for improper mob size in 'check' command, set mob size
            properly on creation

            changed 'thief' to 'rogue' in all appropriate places

            added mob NPC class bitflag stuff, added in all appropriate places

            added #includes that unix loves and nobody else gives a fuck
            about (all of em string.h)

            updated aff4 flags, they was wrong

            released this as 2.98c

 10/12/99 - updated flag menu funcs to allow proper editing of enumerated
            vars as well as bitvects - added for sector menu, makes it easier
            to update shit blah blah

            made interpFlag() a tad more efficient

            can no longer use ; to enter flags directly

  11/1/99 - added 'asbitv' arg to caneditflag, for new defval treatment when
            using 'enumerated' flagdefs

            updated various shit for new defVal treatment, tried to update
            interpEditFlags but seem to have failed, will have to look into
            it more at a later date

            got interpEditFlags working, alas now i must update myriad
            display functions

            hurray, it all appears to work now - functions all assume that
            no defVal is shared by two or more flagDefs

            altered specialObjValEdit and related to allow editing fields
            with enum menus

            updated a few places for new enum flagdefs

            added for obj craftsmanship

  11/7/99 - added object type list, need to update quest and shop editing,
            shan't be easy but shan't be hard - object misc menu uses new
            obj list

            changed ';' for 'direct' type to '!' - ';' gets assigned with
            > 30 or so items

            changed fixed-length strings in flagDefRec (or whatever) to
            const char *s..  duh.  made EXE a bit smaller

            updated shop menu bought list to use new object type menus -
            also added checking for duplicate obj types in list

            updated quest item type selection for new enum list

            created displaySkillList(), added skill list help for quest
            item editing

  11/8/99 - whoops, updated long var versions of interpEditFlags and
            checkCommonFlags..

            updated quests to use object type menu when appropriate,
            commented out displayObjTypeList() stuff

            updated mob hometown list for new menus

            updated mob sex editing for new menus

            updated mob def pos/position editing for new menus

            allowed negative input for 'direct values' in long val version
            of interpEditFlag

            added missing mob position type - db.c seems to interpret it as
            standing 'prone' (I think?), so added as 'prone'

            changed getString to allow 'down arrowing past last entry',
            clearing line..  like DOSkey and maybe other crap, plus, it's
            handy

  11/9/99 - updated obj size editing for new menus - alas, lost super-verbose
            help but perhaps that isn't a bad thing

            updated some obj-type specific editing ...  slowly but surely

            commented out some unused displayList code for 'old new' combat
            armor stuff

 11/15/99 - updated missile editing for new menus for quivers, ranged weapons,
            missiles

            updated liquid editing for new menus

            updated shield/armor thickness editing for new menus

            updated room extra desc editing to allow display and editing of
            more than 12 extra descs (must've been in since 1.0..  r0ck)

 11/20/99 - replaced static-length string in command record with const char *..
            will save a tiny bit of RAM, woo

            also, increased length of aliased strings from 40 to 80 - alias
            length was also based on max command length, for whatever gay-ass
            reason

            whoops, commented out 'display mob size list' code

            added stuff for displaying quest messages - specifically, 'tell'
            command - keywords for messages, q# for quest finishing messages,
            d# for quest disappearance messages

            changed checkMaster/EditableList to allow multiple digit numeric
            specification..  hurray

  1/07/00 - updated everything to support 'ioun stones' (new eq)

  1/14/00 - (or so) released this as 2.98d

  1/31/00 - fixed fh.h for unix version of utoa..  fun

  3/27/00 - updated for new flags, will move flag stuff out to a file someday
            soon

  6/14/00 - display of limits scan/no psi room flags in 'mud mode' was
            incorrect.  doh.  additionally the flags were never renamed in
            roombits.h.  doh.  fixed both.

  8/13/00 - switched back to Watcom 10.0a, since 11 has the lame-ass dos4gw
            problems

            added code to define bool/true/false, since 10.0a doesn't
            support em

            lest I forget, change color code-handling code to make &+M&+l-type
            code reset bold bit

            updated flagdef.cpp, listdef.cpp, various .h files for new flags/
            races/etc

            updated displayColorString() to disregard bold bit

            added new spell/skill types, new classes, new races

            updated mobhere.cpp for race/evilness checking of eq

            bumped version up to 2.98e (for release, you see)

  8/17/00 - 'createedit exit' creates exit, but after prompt does not edit
            exit.  'ce e n' works fine though

            add search mode for skill selection (for quests) and display
            of selected skill in 'verbose menu' mode.  also, use new 'flag
            type' code for zone reset mode

  8/20/00 - error was actually in 'create exit' command, since createedit
            seems to work fine ...  added output, twas missing

            updated NUMB_OBJ_APPLIES from 2 to 4, though more than 2 cannot
            currently be edited/created (mud has supported 4 for a while)

            added check errors for _IGNORE_ keywords in objects/mobs

            fixed scanKeyword() to upcase match-o string passed in (why not?)
            this should also fix a little bug with foot items with the
            keyword horseshoe for centaurs, or, something

            whoops a dammit, forgot to add new races to displayMobSpeciesList()
            func - they are added now

  8/24/00 - to fix -

            * apparently can hit 'one letter past' edesc list and
            crash de; allow more than 12 edescs displayed on an object
            (similar to room); 'move past' menu keys for edesc selection
            keys

            * and hey, add 'global quest echoing' for all quest shit, like
            messages, and uh so on - might as well pass it through act()
            so that $n and $N can be used (mob name, ch name) [this is to
            the mud, heh heh ho ho] - use 'letter + 1' to specify talking
            to entire group, easiest way, i'm afraid - also, may want to
            change object keyword of _id_ requirement to a flag, or just
            remove the requirement altogether..  it's only checked in
            spell_identify, doy.  at any rate i guess it doesn't matter eh
            paco

            * edesc letters 'repeat' (go to A) after '@' (not much i can do
            about this, there are maybe 10 other characters available, in
            two blocks)

            * need to put deletion prompt on same line as current position,
            rather than at 24 (why?  WHY??)

            * change the way IDs are done for objects..  show the current
            ID vals in menu, or at least keywords/short (maybe)

            fixed -

            can now use 'X' and 'Q' when editing room edescs w/o
            quitting out - additionally, this allows an extra edesc on the
            list!  WOOHOO!

            'delete edesc' prompt is now shown on current line..

            heh, problem with de crashing was due to me not doing any
            bounds checking on key hit..  so if any edescs existed and you
            hit a key that would correspond to an edesc that didn't exist,
            the program would kill itself.  now, if it finds no node, it
            just exits out (good enough, cap'n)

            limited room edesc list to edesc with keypress of '@'..  sure,
            limiting the editable amount to around 40 is cruel, but that's
            life

            optimized 'max edesc displayable' val for room editing, also
            fixed minor display problems

            hurray, can now edit object edescs in a remarkably similar way
            to room edescs

            in a perfect world, fix string nodes to support any realistic (heh)
            string size..  at the same time, having a static size of 256 is
            lame and of course, lame, or something

            changed string nodes to use dynamically allocated strings and
            keep track of length (what the hell, eh?!) - also made em somewhat
            OOP-y by adding ctor, dtor, and handy 'setString' method.
            amazingly, everything seems to work

            updated keywords.cpp, strnnode.cpp, history.cpp for new string
            nodes

            strange - was having problems with setString() working
            improperly, but i changed the ctor to use an initialization
            list and now it works like a charm.  god bless you, C++/Watcom/
            whatever.  at any rate, it appears the stringNode change has
            gone swimmingly, but no doubt i am wrong

            added new var (difficulty) and flag (random eq) to zones

            added zone check options

            added neato keen 'flag-type menu' for zone reset mode

            added neato keen 'in-menu display' of object ID codes

  8/25/00 - added aggro and aggro2 bitvectors for mobs, for enhanced
            aggroness

  8/27/00 - can now specify 'echo messages to all' for quest messages and
            quest quests

            released as 2.98f

            added aggro bitvector checking to 'check' command

  9/11/00 - monitor works again, most curious..  fixed problem with 'quest
            quest' editing having overlapping 'C' key

  10/9/00 - added 'githzerai' mob type, added missing 'thief' indicator
            to getMobClassStrn()

            fixflags now resets improper mob class flags, check now checks
            for same sort of flags

            released as 2.98g

  11/2/00 - allow 'plane of water' sector type when checking underwater bit
            stuff

            added 'no reset' to extra2

            removed 'followers not sentinel' check, mud sets em sentinel on
            load

  11/5/00 - removed auto 'guild zone' variable setting

  12/2/00 - added new room, mob flags - need to change stuff, maybe, or maybe
            not - need to update roombits.h, mobbits.h, look command for
            room flag display, etc

            updated *bits.h files, look command, 'fixguild' command to reset
            new aggro flags (hooray, blah), and documentation

            hmm, had problem with zone getting set to all 0s, but it seems to
            have gone away somehow.  perhaps i was merely confused, but it
            got set to all 0s somehow, and all i did is move around init
            code and uhh oh well whatever

            released as 2.98h

  12/6/00 - whoops a daisy, added 'troops' type to getObjTypeStrn() and etc

 12/15/00 - when deleting a room, update the prompt always.  huzzah, my child

 12/22/00 - death flag for rooms was improperly specified as 'limits scan'.
            i'm not sure how this happened, but hey, it's fixed now.

  1/22/01 - changed 'harps' instrument to 'harp'

            minor updates here and there, for the hell of it

            forgot to check 'ioun' wear bit in object check shiznit

            whoops, when tell'ing to quest mobs de would notify you of public
            echoing only on messages, not quest finishing/disappearance
            messages..  plus it's now in bright white!

  2/xx/01 - sometime - added angel choice (AN)

  4/25/01 - added raksasha race (RA)

            replaced missing map square sector characters (water plane etc)
            with '?'

  8/07/01 - added new zone flag, 'map', and changed 'random eq' zone flag to
            'new reset' (not used yet i don't think)

            need to update to use zone map flag instead of ISMAPZONE var

  9/03/01 - fixed bug with not properly redisplaying prompt when aborting
            deleting an extra desc

  5/20/02 - tweaked things a bit so that DE would compile under VS.net

            fixed old old old bug in fixStringNodes() that wasn't initializing
            a variable - should have caused crashes when trying to use a
            description with no lines, don't know that it did

            released as 2.98i, unleashed the source unto the world - enjoy

  8/18/05 - made arrow keys and home/end/delete work in Win32 version

            made 'notepad' the default text editor for Win32 version

            any text editor that takes command line arguments will now properly work under Win32

            fixed bug in dikuEdit's description editing code that would have ignored any lines at the
            end that didn't have carriage returns - was never noticed because EDIT always adds a CR
            
            changed Win32 version to pop up a message box if you try to run DE with no command-line
            arguments (i.e. by double-clicking on it)

            updated the email address shown by the 'version' command

            released as 2.98j

  8/20/05 - fixed problem with shift being registered as a keypress, thus making '$' not clear a
            'virgin' field - also control, but not as big a deal

            updated archive, left version at 2.98j
            
  9/05/05 - fixed problem with DE occasionally trying to set the row to 137 or so - some bug in
            Windows' 'get cursor pos' code returns erroneous results when cursor is at the bottom of
            the screen, nothing in docs about it, so just set row to console window size if it's
            larger than the size
            
            found bug in room exit editing (from room menu) - 'getExitAvail' func was poorly named,
            so renamed it to 'getExitTaken', there was no reason to call getExitAvail in that case
            anyway, but fixed everything
            
            simplified deleteExitPromptPrompt() code, made it show feedback instead of nothing
            
            changed version to 2.98jj
            
  9/08/05 - resolved all 'signed/unsigned mismatch' and 'unsafe conversion' warnings
  
            increased string lengths in a few places (mostly aliases), but really the entire editor 
            is just waiting for its buffers to overflow

            debug EXE in debug mode is now reporting that stack is being corrupted somewhere around an
            objhere load in zonefile reading - both release and debug work fine, but old version didn't
            report corrupted stack..  not based on vnum.  whee.
            
  9/10/05 - problem with stack corruption was that the 'ifflag' var used throughout various zone loading
            functions was a char, but scanf was reading it as a %d.  changed ifflag to uint, read as
            %u, also updated various room/obj/etc number code to read as %u rather than %d, fixed ifflag
            in every function.  oh yeah, old version would have reported stack corruption if i ever
            loaded a zone with zone commands (load, put, etc), way back to 0.00000001 i imagine.  
            additionally the stack around ifflag was always local variables and either 1) always overwritten 
            immediately after the improper reading clobbered it or 2) useless forever after, so it didn't 
            really matter, but who cares
            
            commented out some unused locals, removed unused 'noLF' args from displayColorString() and
            _outtext(), removed useless 'strn2' arg from getObjValueStrn(), EXE got 4k smaller
            
            'check for valid obj material' check option was listed as only checking armor/worn items..
            now it correctly states that it checks all objects
            
            changed project settings so that more optimization should be performed, exe got bigger,
            presumably it's faster, grid creation takes hardly any time even with a 200x200 grid, there's
            really no other process that takes any time, that's it baby
            
  9/11/05 - const'ized shop.cpp, created shopExists(), roomExists(), obj, mob, quest, for when you don't
            want to actually return the room/etc node, updated rooms, shops, everything else
            
            changed various #define bool-types to actual bools, changed 'edit exit' var name zoneType to 
            zoneState, cleaned up comments, added const all over the place, optimized lastNode-setting
            code in createMobUser() and createMobObj()
            
            changed createmob/obj to always take uint for vnum and instead take extra bool for 'get free
            numb'
            
            changed dikuRoom to room, dikuObject to objectType, dikuMob to mobType, dikuZone to zone,
            dikuEdit to durisEdit, some other diku thing, dikuZoneExit or something
            
            made createExitRoomPrompt() more modular and readable by moving redundant functionality to
            function
            
            made deleteExitPromptPrompt() similarly more modular
            
            changed deleteRoomExit() to update g_madeChanges if decNumbEntities is true
            
            changed createRoomPrompt() to use same func as create/deleteRoomExit, made it more modular
            elsewhere, made it display which exits were being created, and fixed problem with not 
            deleting exit when hitting 'Q' on second prompt, not sure how that happened, i vaguely recall 
            changing it though way back when
            
            created getVarNumbUnsigned(), returns var as an unsigned long rather than a long, changed
            getSaveHowOftenVal() to return uint, changed commandsEntered to uint
            
            changed displayFlagMenu() to respect getScreenWidth() value rather than assume 80 -
            could be tweaked as far as number of max columns, maybe..  hard to test without a large
            group of flags/values
            
            commented out all bold/flash var code
            
            changed deleteShop() and deleteQuest() to take bool as to whether to update the actual zone
            or not similar to deleteMobType() etc - will add for create funcs
            
            defined absolute minimums for screen width and height, which are forced from addVar() -
            defined new error code, 'var below minimum'
            
            changed getScreenHeight() and getScreenWidth() and associated funcs to return ulongs, thus
            all the 'numb lines displayed' vars needed to be changed to ulongs, thus why the above change
            was made, because a screen height below 3 would make things explode
            
            made getString() handle initial errors better - return pointer to strn rather than static,
            only set strn to 1 char numeric value so as to perhaps 'auto-repair' the problem
            
            updated getString() to use unsigned vars for width, height, and other various things
            
            fixed memory leaks that would have occurred if trying to 'stat object' with no args or
            no object found
            
            changed mob 'level' var from uchar to long, was read and written as %d anyway
            
            updated mob money value editing code and obj value code to check for validity (no negs)
            
            fixed up 'edit obj misc 2' bits for properness, should check everything
            
            finished const/bool/general bug-checking on editoms2.c
            
  9/12/05 - made quest editing menu only take mob ptr rather than mob name, mob numb, and mob; if def
            quest editing is added, can just use NULL mob
            
            g_madeChanges wasn't set if somehow altering a quest with 'edit quest' command
            
            changed editQuest() to only take mob ptr, seems wacky to pass in both - support funcs
            still take both
            
            created global g_exitkeys[] and g_exitflags[] tables to further facilitate modularization of
            exit code
            
            changed displayEditRoomExits() to use new table
            
            changed getExitTakenFlags() to use g_exitflags[]
            
            changed room's current and fallChance vars from uchar to uint
            
            removed old #if 0'd room sector editing code, and other similarly useless (probably) code
            in various files
            
            replaced appropriate char vars in shop rec with bool, changed others to long or uint for
            ultimate goodness
            
            created isValidBoolYesNo() func for purposes of verifying valid bool yes/no-ness, 
            getBoolYesNo will return only true/false soon, no -1
            
            changed shop editing in a way quite similar to quest editing, just pass mob etc etc
            
            renamed extra-vague mobHere var 'objectHead' to 'inventoryHead'
            
            increased max room name from 128 to 256 chars (for people with lots of color codes) -
            might break something, should test
            
            added all appropriate .H files to 'Header Files' folder in VS solution
            
            added comments to equip.cpp funcs to clear er up
            
            updated const/bool goodness to exit.cpp inclusive
            
  9/13/05 - could be bug in whichFlags() if something matches room and mob flag (will this ever happen?)
  
            updated to massSet() in flags.cpp exclusive
            
            fixed bug in dispGetStrnField() wherein edit string would be copied beyond the end, up to
            the width of the field - also removed unnecessary recalc of strlen of substrn
            
            fixing above bug fixed bug wherein hitting delete/backspace/etc when first editing a wide
            field wouldn't redraw the field as cleared
            
            removed memset() of entire string in getStrn() - not necessary
            
            changed dispGetStrnField() to use NULL-ness of fillerChStrn to determine whether to use a
            filler char rather than having a separate bool
            
            changed dispGetStrnField() to only create/delete substrn if displaying wide fields
            
            fixed right arrow handling in getStrn(), made it simpler in fact, simplified other parts by
            deleting commented code and extra if's
            
            SHELL and FREESTACK commands no longer work under Win32 - shell crashed Win32 and is quite
            useless in a multitasking environment and freestack only ever worked with Watcom
            
            removed "'$' char shows free stack" from 'edit room/obj/mob' code - olde artyfacte
            
            increased max length of main prompt input string to 256 chars (de.h)
            
            fixed wackiness with using arg strings passed into takeEntityFromEntity() as output
            strings - conceivably could have caused crashes with long enough obj names
            
            stopped at takeEntityFromEntity() after spotting various #error'd flaws
            
  9/14/05 - made addObjHeretoList() slightly more efficient
  
            created addEditabletoList()
            
            created createEditableListNode()
            
            created getObjShortName() & getMobShortName(), which check for NULL obj and return "(not in 
            zone)" msg, makes things simpler in inventory-type handling
            
            replaced all old obj/mob "(not in zone)" string generation with new funcs
            
            made 'get all from container' code better
            
            created removeObjLoad(), which decs g_numbObjs, calls decEntity() and so forth
            
            changed removeObjHereinList() to take decLoaded bool, which calls removeObjLoad()
            
            changed deleteObjHere() to call removeObjLoad()
            
            updated takeEntityFromEntity() to call various funcs recently created, use vnum bools &
            uint vnums
            
            changed findObjHere() to not set *roomNumb if roomNumb is NULL
            
            removed various useless 'blah' vars due to change above
            
            changed names of other 'blah' vars to better ones
            
            added comments galore to takeEntityFromEntity, changed code to transfer obj around rather
            than deleting/creating it
            
            changed displayRoom() to reset color on objHeres not in zone properly
            
            moved take functions to new file, take.cpp
            
            stopped at takeEntity() in take.cpp, will need to return to inv.cpp and fix drop funcs and
            move them out, etc.
            
  9/15/05 - created takeAll() func, transfers all objs in objHere list to inventory
  
            replaced some chunks of code in takeEntity() with calls to createEditable...()
            
            changed findObjHere() to not use any default args - will change all funcs soon
            
            cleaned up/added comments to the first chunk of takeEntity()
            
            changed strnumer() to not take pos arg, changed one place that used pos to use strn + 1
            
            realized I am being dumb with extra deletion of editableNodes - should just make a
            'copy editable node' function and use that if necessary, would be extra-easy
            
            also, 'dispTook' functions are just extra crap now that takeAll() is generalized
            
  9/16/05 - grabbing the editableListNode from the room list is a fair amount of trouble, such that
            changing everything necessary would just make the code harder to decipher with barely any
            benefit, and even then only from a strict efficiency standpoint
            
            cleaned up takeEntity() func to copy less and call functions, making it much easier to
            read
            
            removed dispTookMsg() funcs
            
            removed dropEntity() from inv.cpp and placed in drop.cpp, const-ized etc dropEnt() and will
            fix it up for good later
            
            readded 'mob only' option to take (using m. - i.e. take m.33, it only works for vnums though)
            
  9/17/05 - created addObjLoad() and addMobLoad() functions
  
            changed createMobHereinRoom() and createObjHereinRoom() to take incLoaded arg
            
            moved above two funcs out of crtobj.cpp and crtmob.cpp and into objhere.cpp and mobhere.cpp
            
            changed dropEntity()'s 'drop all' code to be better
            
            forgot about deleteOriginal for take all..
            
            forgot to have removeObjLoad() also remove contained objs
            
            ditto for addObjLoad()
            
            updated loadAllinObjHereList() to properly update g_numbObjs if object contains items..
            old bug, affected drop/put inventory code
            
            changed addMobLoad() to load all objects carried/equipped by mob
            
            fixed bug wherein dropping a mob by vnum that wasn't immediately found would crash DE
            
            changed strnumer() to return FALSE if string is empty, fixing 'list loaded' and who
            knows what else
            
            updated displayLoadedList() to tell the user if no match was found
            
            fully updated dropEntity() for new function/method goodness
            
            updated up through keywords.cpp
            
  9/18/05 - moved loadAllinObjHereList() to objhere.cpp, changed to call addObjLoad()
  
            moved removeMobLoad() to mobhere.cpp, removeObjLoad() to objhere.cpp
            
            changed removeMobLoad() to take mobHere * rather than vnum, also changed to remove 
            equip/inventory, updated all appropriate functions for new method, removeMobHerefromList() 
            would have not decremented object loads, was called from 'take' code

            displayMap() code wouldn't have cleared 16k temp buffer if screen size was too small
            
            fixed memory leak in lookStuff() whereby keywords weren't cleared for masterListNodes created
            on the fly
            
            created deleteMasterListNode() for above function, updated delete master list func to call
            this
            
            updated a few alias funcs to use const strn args where they should, will update actual code
            later
            
  9/19/05 - updated actual alias code
  
            fixed alias handling in mainExecCommand() so that aliased string wasn't immediately uppercased
            
            updated setExecCommandFile() (called when reading .SET files) to not upstrn aliases
            
            finished up to maincomm.cpp inclusive
            
            changed masterListNode struct to use const ptr for descHead, lookStuff() similarly,
            checkMasterKeywordList() to return const stringNode *
            
            removed useless error-checking code in checkMasterKeywordList()
            
            changed lookup command to remove Duris codes from room titles when matching
            
            changed 'list room' command similarly
            
            fixed bug in lookup() that would not display === between matching room and mob (no obj)
            
            lookup() func in general is wacky - specifically it doesn't say what's a mob and what's a
            room etc, though i suspect it would be obvious 99.999999% of the time
            
            stopped on where() in misc.cpp, function is obfuscated and must be..  corrected.  lookup
            could use a similar thing, like what about that 'checkPause()' func
            
            placed checkPause() in the proper places in where(), still needs other fixup though
            
  9/20/05 - replaced code with checkPause() whereever appropriate, fixed bug in setTemplateArgs() whereby
            numblines wouldn't be reset after a pause..  nice to know i tested this stuff, HA
            
            changed displayObjTypeList(char *) to remove color codes from object name when matching
            
            updated through misccomm.cpp inclusive
            
  9/21/05 - changed renumberMobs() to work better, i think - should change renumberRoom() and renumberObj()
            in the similar method
            
            changed compareObjectType() to check all obj applies based on NUMB_OBJ_APPLIES rather than
            just the first 2
            
            updated renumberObjs() in the same way as renumberMobs()
            
            updated through purge.cpp inclusive
            
  9/22/05 - updated version to 2.99
  
            fixed leaks in put, other leaks in take, cleaned up put code a little
            
            created deleteEditable() func, updated all appropriate to call it
            
            fixed bug in put code whereby matching items in inventory by vnum wouldn't work properly,
            not sure how long it's existed, i may have introduced it mere minutes ago myself
            
            i suspect put has more leaks, specifically in copying/creating objHeres, and why copy and
            delete original, code is odd, i will fix it later
            
  9/23/05 - vastly improved put code by never creating container/containee nodes and by passing objHeres
            around when possible rather than always creating them
            
            fixed bug in deleteMobHere() wherein equipment/inventory was deleted before calling removeLoad()
            
            ditto for deleteObjHere()
            
            removed default arguments from all functions
            
            created one-arg version of clrline() - default args are lame, overloaded functions aren't
            created three-arg version of clrline()
            
            fixed "put all" to not call itself and also to be better
            
            changed compareQuestMessageLists() to call compareQuestMessage()
            
            made quest received items and given items descriptions better
            
            changed getQuestRecvString() to call getQuestItemString(), or something like that
            
            changed displayQuestList() to go in order by vnum
            
            reduced MAX_QUESTRECVITEMLIST length so it would fit on an 80 wide screen
            
            fixed potential overflow in reading mob money, hit dice, and damage dice
            
            increased max length of input strings when reading .OBJ files to 512 to match .MOB, ditto
            for .QST, ditto for .SHP and shopRec, ditto for .WLD, .ZON
            
            increased max length of filenames in .MOB and .OBJ reading to 512, was 80 in .MOB and 256
            in .OBJ (go figure), also .QST, .SHP, .WLD, .ZON
            
            increased length of 'dummy' strings in zone-reading to fix potential buffer overflow
            
            updated quest info reading to check if incomplete string has been read, to check length
            of quest info type
            
            changed vnum, type, everything that makes sense in entityLoaded and funcs and lastObjLoaded,
            or something like that, uint baby
            
  9/24/05 - (past midnight) fixed insertChar to not suck
  
            updated bool var funcs to return bool rather than char, updated all 'predefined' var funcs
            appropriately
            
            updated getBoolYesNo to just return false if no 'yes' is found - only used in shop reading,
            so works fine for yours truly (me)
            
            no more warnings.  good
            
            updated getRoomSval to return uint rather than long
            
            updated through vardef.cpp inclusive, win32.cpp could use some improvement as far as setting
            the input mode every single call to getkey(), i think
            
            changed win32 display code to init input mode in setupWindowsConsole and never change it in
            getkey()
            
            changed win32 getkey() func to respect more than one keypress in an event
            
            updated writeMobFile() to allow longer filenames, writeObjFile(), writeQuestFile(), 
            writeSetFile(), writeWorldFile(), writeZoneFile()
            
            simplified writeSetFile() (fprintf rather than strcpy, strcat, fputs), minor similar in
            others
            
            and voila, all files have been reviewed and adjusted
            
            changed displayColorString() to use a big-ass stack string rather than always new'ing and
            delete'ing a temporary one
            
            replaced all appropriate TRUE/FALSE with true/false
            
            removed incLoaded from copyMobHere() and copyObjHere(), was never used and logically they
            never need to be - this also caused me to spot and fix a bug in copyMobHereList() that would
            have loaded mob eq twice if incLoaded was true
            
            yet another bug in deleteObjHereList() with deleting obj contents before calling removeLoad()
            
            same with deleteMobHereList()
            
            fixed bug in deleteObjHereList() wherein contents were dec'd at least twice
            
            created atexit() func for Win32 so that console would wait for a keypress before dying
            
            fixed renumber command so that the new and old ranges aren't allowed to overlap (function
            errors out), which was the source of any historical problems with renumber
            
            still ran into ye olde 'trying to load stuff into non-container' renumber bug, but no idea
            how to reproduce it..  same old same old
            
            found bug in renumbering - problem is that code runs through list from head to end rather
            than going solely by vnum
            
            changed room renumber code to run through rooms by vnum, and to not require wacky pre-
            setting before calling renumberRooms()
            
            nah there's still some sort of bug manifesting itself in renumberObj() with out of order
            objs
            
            when editing room, obj, mob vnums from editing menus, low/high limits were not reset..
            old, old, old bug
            
            above bug may have been the problem, since i was also going below the low limit while testing
            and so various things would not go through the entire list (?) - writeObject() for example,
            though it seemed like the objects were getting written to the file, but i never checked, so
            probably not
            
            everything seems to work now..  updated renumber code for objs, it seems to work
            
            updated renumber code for mobs, it too seems to work
            
            changed all renumber commands to not allow renumber from 0 (uint - 1 might cause problems
            somewhere, and this basic idea is implemented everywhere else)
            
            changed list obj code to run through list numerically, also seems to have been a bug in
            'list obj by keyword' that would only have used the short obj name from the first object?
            whee.
            
            never mind, still some bug in renumbering - renumbered container obj to vnum of 1 (before
            everything else), then renumbered to 4010, and zone file became broken
            
  9/25/05 - readded resetEntityPointersbyNumb() calls to renumberObj and renumberMob
  
            made vnum change errors while editing obj, mob, room echo a message
            
            disallowed setting vnum to 0 in edit room/obj/mob menus (thought I did this already, guess
            not)
            
            made 'trying to put obj in non-container obj' errors ignorable warnings rather than always-
            die
            
            bug in renumbering was not setting tempstart (start of 'temporary' range) high enough - was
            highest vnum + 1 instead of highest vnum + number of types
            
            thus, code that checked for 'overlapping ranges' is no longer needed

            fixed too-short string problems in display objhere, where, display objtype list, display
            mobtype list, displayRoom, writeWorldExit, editExit, editObj (keyword), editMob (keyword),
            editEdesc (keyword), displayQuest, displayShop, readWorldExit, readObjEdesc, readRoomEdesc,
            readShop, editQuestMessage (keyword) funcs
            
            changed OBJKEY_LEN from MAX_STRNNODE_LEN (which is 16k) to 256
            
            ditto for MOBKEY_LEN
            
            ditto for EDESCKEY_LEN
            
            defined MAX_QSTMSGKEY_LEN in quest.h, used it
            
            fixed mount/follow bugs where rider could follow someone or mount could follow his rider
            
            fixed bug in mob editing whereby user could create a shop for a mob loaded more than once
            
            fixed various places where a full shop 'items sold list' could cause overflow madness
            (array is 0-terminated unless it is full) - same with 'item types bought list'
            
            fixed various places where mob/obj/room name was not shortened enough for menu header to
            only take one line at 80 column width
            
            made 'not enough %s' errors in shop reading more descriptive (# needed)
            
            max length of .SET line was a mere 128, increased to 1024
            
            increased internal lengths of alias/var handling strings so that the longest possible alias
            (referencing the longest possible vars and longest possible argument lists) does not crash DE
            
            allowed the 'alias' command to contain semicolons so that you can define aliases with
            semicolons from the prompt, but they won't expand..  it seems like they worked once..?  at
            any rate they don't now
            
  9/26/05 - fixed command interpreter to handle semicolons and aliases correctly, created a few helper
            funcs, entire thing became simpler and more robust overall
            
            fixed bugs in addVarCmd() whereby you could set height and width to 0 and other silliness
            with not checking things in the right place etc blah blah
            
            current flaws (?) in interp code - aliases cannot call aliases, variables can only be deref'd
            inside aliases.  but are these flaws
            
            fixed problems in followMob() with combining mounts/mounters with following
            
            updated 'which' command to check mob class flags
            
            uploaded to Jollython
            
  9/27/05 - fixed minor bugs in vnum changing code, uploaded to Jollython
  
  9/28/05 - began work on using standard 'open filename' code if DE has no args under Win32
  
            finished work, can create new zone (overwriting any old zone) and open existing zone
            
            .SET file reading (maybe writing too) didn't have long enough filename for max, neither did
            writeFiles() which used it for deleting qst/shp, and neither did the read/write default 
            room/mob/etc commands.  whoops
            
            uploaded to Jollython
            
            fixed yet another bug in string size in writeDefaultFiles() and possibly readDefFiles..
            
            uploaded to Jollython
            
  9/30/05 - fixed minor mem leak in take.cpp when attempting to get an item from an object that is
            not a container by vnum (container by vnum that is)
            
            minor changes to put.cpp and drop.cpp (no need for a few externs)
            
            minor cleanup of old default arg stuff, etc. etc. etc.
            
            uploaded to Jollython
            
  10/1/05 - added link to Jollython to 'version' command
  
            uploaded to Jollython
            
            added mob class flag to 'massset' command
            
            uploaded to Jollython
            
            updated numbLinesStringNeeds() to check for linefeeds and generally work properly
            
            updated dumpTextFile() to process final strings with no linefeeds
            
            uploaded to Jollython
            
 10/23/05 - replaced overly-complex version of numbArgs() with better version that I devised later and
            used in other projects then rediscovered
            
            improved getArg() in a similar manner
            
            uploaded to Jollython
            
 10/26/05 - updated displayFlagMenu() to not dynamically allocate anything, editFlags() to not
            delete anything
            
 10/29/05 - began integrating changes made on Duris version of DE
 
            found and fixed bug in copyMobHereList() that would not have incremented numb loaded on 
            equipment - only mattered when cloning rooms, though
            
            made 'list room' command always show rooms sorted, same with 'list exit'
            
            fixed bug in checkMobs() whereby long quest message keyword list could easily overflow and 
            crash DE
            
            fixed bug whereby only minos and centaurs could wear whole body, maybe, hell if i know, anyway
            it's better than before

            completed merge, as a result gained colored race/class names, new flags/types
            
            fixed bugs that i thought i fixed 80 billion years ago with not being able to equip things in
            certain slots (ioun, badge, on belt, others)
            
            updated version to 2.99b
            
            added 'limit' as synonym for 'loaded' arg to 'lookup' command
            
            actually, it was a bug that copyMobHereList() ever incremented anything, because loadMob() call 
            handles all that

  11/1/05 - fixed dumb bug in handling of 'listed races/classes can use' flag, uploaded to Jollython

  11/8/05 - recompiled with Pentium 4 opt, SSE, and remove unused refs, went from 652k to 664k.  but i
            bet it's faster.  maybe.
            
            changed over to __fastcall, exe is now 660k!

 11/10/05 - updated de.doc, updated archive, uploaded to Jollython, don't know that i put de.exe in there,
            who cares

  1/14/06 - compiled 32 and 64-bit under VS 2005, worked like a charm, why i did this, i'm not sure

            also, when doing a grid 25 25 25, got a few 'cannot find matching room in createExit()'
            errors

   2/8/06 - fixed bug whereby editing mob aff2 flags would use aff1 flag type array
   
            XP64 is setting errno even on a successful system() call to editor, or some shit, so only
            check errno in editStringNodes() if system() returns a non-zero value
            
            fixed overflow bug whereby alias that expanded out to a large string would crash DE when
            trying to copy expanded value into lastCommand var..  wonder how I never caught this..?
            at any rate the solution is to store the original user input, not the expanded value.
            also changed DE to store last command after executing any commands, so that if you type 'set'
            you can see the actual last command and not always 'set'
            
            fixed bug whereby setting a variable to its already-existing value gave no output
            
            internally updated version to 2.99c
            
            updated all important string functions in strings.cpp to use pointers for string manipulation
            rather than array indexing as well as numbLinesStringNeeds() in Misc.cpp
            
            made 'command not found' message more explicit
            
            fixed dumptextcolor getting its filename argument uppercased

            sent to Beretorn
            
   2/9/06 - changed DE to not compile with SSE/SSE2 instructions since the libraries don't auto-sense
            the presence of SSE/SSE2 and instead just die on older processors, like Beretorn's

            sent to Beretorn

  2/16/06 - uploaded 2.99c to Jollython
            
   3/8/06 - updated unixgraph.cpp to have all versions of clrline()
   
            also lowercased all filenames a few days ago
            
            uploaded all this jazz to J-thon

   5/7/06 - bug with DE and scrollback - isn't setting text position properly, should review console funcs

            long obj name creates too-long header line in obj trap affect editing

  5/23/06 - fixed minor bug whereby aborting viewing a file in dumpTextFile() would not close the file
            handle
            
            bug in obj name exists in craftsmanship, trap aff flag, trap damage type, also mob default pos,
            also room current direction
            
            fixed afore-mentioned display bugs
            
            added date DE compiled to output of 'version' command
            
            fixed issue with Win32 version whereby scrollback wasn't entirely cleared on clrscr(), causing
            old crap to pop up later

            loaded, rather than nothing at all
            
            updated 3-arg version of displayEntireObjectHereList() for above change
            
            removed 'press a key' pause in middle of list in displayRecordSizeInfo() since it will all fit
            on a 25-line screen
            
            updated displayObjHereList() and displayMobHereList() to run through rooms sorted by vnum
            
  5/30/06 - don't use sprintf_s in displayTextFile() since it's really just an MS thing
  
            no need to reclear chars in Win32 clrscr() if color is non-black

            updated editStringNodes() to call getcwd() rather than _getcwd() since g++ doesn't recognize
            _getcwd() despite it 'not being ISO conformant'
            
            only use __cdecl keyword in main decl if under Win32

            twice when dropping by vnum
            
            fixed a few places in shop 'item type bought' editing code that used MAX_NUMBSHOPITEMS instead of

            removed mob-only ('M.') feature from take command
            
            changed unequip to allow unequipping an object by vnum

            putEntity()
            
            improved displayLoadedList() by removing redundant vnum matching/not vnum matching listing
            code
            
            improved countSemicolons() in interp.cpp by using pointer rather than subscripts
            
            fixed bug in displayColorString() whereby color characters in valid &=xy code would be reversed
            when 'display color code' DE var was true
            
            improved displayRoomFlagsandSector() in disproom.cpp to use pointer rather than subscripts in
            underscore replacement
            
   6/8/06 - fixed long-standing bug with setting x-pos of first flag column to 0 instead of 1, resulting in
            invalid initial call to _settextposition() for first column
            
            this fixes the 'too-long header causes first column to be offset from flag values by 1' bug
            
   6/9/06 - improved displayColorString by creating setTextColor
   
            should see if flash/blink is supported in Windows console apps - it's not
            
            moved redundant code in tell() to getQuestTellCmd()
            
            removed needless linefeeds from header passed to all editFlags() calls

            a blank line to be displayed
            
  6/10/06 - fixed bug in statEntity() where invalid arg message would not mention 'zone'

            improved toggleVar() code, wrote isVarBoolean() that takes variable arg            
            
            moved direct.h include in strnnode.cpp to non-UNIX only (doesn't compile under UNIX), removed

  6/11/06 - added blank line to the end of all non-blank-lined .h files
  
            ditto for .cpp
  
            removed inline.h, INLINEDEC, and INLINEDEF from everything
            
            removed const.h, _CONST from everything
            
            source should now compile without warnings on all platforms (except maybe Watcom..  I should get
            another copy and try it out, under Win32 I guess)
            
            altered graphcon.h to handle all 3 platform cases, removed duplicate #if/#else block from
            all files that had included graphcon.h
            
            removed getRoomExitInfo(), merged into displayRoomExitInfo()
            
            removed old empty initWindowsScreen() function and call
            
            removed mapiutil.h, mapiwin.h includes from graphcon.h, only win32.cpp needs them, manually
            typedef'd WORD in fh.h and SHORT in graphcon.h
            
            changed getMobHereEquipSlot()'s 'where' arg from uint to long since -1 is considered valid
            
            moved exitUnixCurses() and initUnixCursesScreen() into unixgraph.cpp, deleted initscr.cpp
            
  6/12/06 - unixgraph.cpp - fixed up color support so that all background colors are supported and
            theoretically so is flash
            
            dispflag.h - gave Unix a more generic-terminal friendly '*' for active flags
            
            should also define 'unused field portion' character instead of having it hardcoded everywhere
            
  6/14/06 - renamed setTextColor() to getTextColor(), added some args, changed displayColorString() so that
            it doesn't reset the colors, removed global blink var from unixgraph.cpp and updated everything
            
            added missing value-editing menus to shield type/shape/size
            
  6/16/06 - fixed bug in grid creation whereby last room was not properly created and crashes were possible
            via a 4-byte overflow onto whatever was next on the heap after the room pointer array
            
            removed all 'register' keywords from source, since every compiler known to man ignores it
  
            changed dispGetStrnField in getstrn.cpp so that under Unix a grey background with spaces is used
            for 'unused' portion of field rather than whatever wacky character pops up for your font
            
            improved getNumbFreeRooms() by replacing indexing with pointers
            
  6/17/06 - simplified deleteRoomUser() by moving deleteRoomUserCommon() code into main function and removing
            redundant checks
            
            started removing unnecessary '&n's from string literals (due to bold not lingering)
            
            made 'load o' and 'load m' commands explicitly state the name of what you've just loaded
            
            improved 'create room' command so that it tells you the vnum of the room you've created
            
            generally improved efficiency of createRoomPrompt()
            
            changed createMobHereUser to call createMobHereStrn once input is taken rather than duplicating
            code
            
            ditto for createObjHereUser
            
            improved output of clone, create mobhere/objhere, create object type, create mob type, create 
            room, delete mob type, delete mobhere, delete obj type, delete objhere, delete quest, delete shop
            (now show name of thing cloned/created/etc)
            
            added args of 'objhere/oh' and 'mobhere/mh' to create so that you can either 'create mh/oh' or
            'load m/o'
            
            fixed minor bugs in handling of mob align/class/species when checking if eq can still be equipped
            
            removed redundant code in editMobTypePrompt(), called editMobTypeStrn() instead
            
            removed references to 'substrings' in output, changed checkForSearchAvail to just return a bool
            rather than a string since I don't think the string is useful
            
            removed redundant code in editObjectTypePrompt(), called editObjectTypeStrn() instead
            
            a few editing prompts were yellow instead of cyan.  go figure
            
            fixed potential crash if specifically unequipping either obj with no type or mob with no type, 
            get it
            
            removed &ns everywhere that mattered
            
            greatly simplified getRoomSectorStrn by creating array of color codes and using g_roomSectList
            flag array
            
            improved efficiency of room editing menu by running through exit keys using tables rather 
            than explicitly one by one
            
            deleted zero-arg version of displayRoomList(), placed logic to list all into arg version
            
            replaced references to '' with explicit UNUSED_FIELD_CH #define, which is in de.h and is 
            ' ' for __UNIX__ since under Unix  doesn't look like anything in particular
            
            deleted zero-arg mob and obj listers
            
            ditto for quest and shop listers
            
  6/27/06 - fixed bug whereby you had to quit and reload DE to edit the vnum of a room created from a 
            default room
            
            ditto for objects and mobs
            
            fixed bug with using findRoom(getHighestRoomNumber()) instead of actually going to the end
            of the linked list
            
            ditto for objects and mobs
            
            I could easily yank the Next (and Last, for rooms) pointers from rooms, object types, and mob
            types, since the lookup list does it all.  someday, maybe
            
  6/28/06 - created flagDef list for shopkeeper race, removed getShopkeeperRaceStrn() and list(), created
            getFlagNameFromList() so as to remove need for getStrn() func, could use this elsewhere
            
            similarly simplified getManaFlagStrn()
            
            similarly simplified getObjSizeStrn()
            
            changed misspelled 'artisian' to artisan
            
            replaced a few ''s that slipped through somehow
            
            removed extra strings from getObjLiquidStrn()
            
            removed extra craftsmanship_strn[] table in common.c, defined my own missile types table and
            removed from common.c
            
            simplified getMaterialStrn() by having function return value from materials[] table in common.c
            
            removed useless globals from common.c
            
            simplified getObjShieldStrn() funcs
            
            ditto for mob sex, size, position
            
            ditto for quest give/receive types
            
            ditto for zone reset mode
            
            changed checkCommands() to not display anything if it has a NULL notfoundStrn and to return
            true/false based on whether a matching command was found
            
            removed pointless strlen(args) == 0 check and error messages from all commands, instead having
            them plop out the useful arg list error messages always
            
            cleaned up swapExits()
            
            added alias, variable, boolean, and template as arguments to LIST command
            
            copydef.cpp and copyDefault() [or whatever] did nothing, so removed the file and function from
            the project
            
            removed unnecessary roomHead non-NULL check from renumberRoomsUser()
            
            cleaned up displayRoom()
            
            improved 'random' command to allow you to set objs/mobs by vnum
            
            removed 'FIRSTOBJEDESCKEY' var, changed logic so it's always true, why anyone would want to
            turn this off is utterly beyond me
            
  6/29/06 - fixed potential crash when clearing inventory of a mob/obj type that you've deleted
  
            fixed color reset bug in 'taken' messages
            
            removed various useless 'default' cases from switches that contained debugging-type error 
            messages that would never be hit in reality, or if they are the programmer can figure it out
            
  6/30/06 - fixed error messages in preDisplayLookupList()
  
            removed redundant code for purging individual mob/obj by keyword and vnum
            
            updated purge to only update g_madeChanges in all/allobj/allmob if something was purged
            
            updated purge to use command list for all/allmob/allobject/inventory args
            
            fixed inevitable crash if malicious-type user did recursive 'at's a la 'at 3 at 3 at 3 at 3'
            
   7/1/06 - fixed bug in object checking whereby DE would always assume that any usable item with all its
            'anti-class' flags set was unusable, even if the 'listed classes CAN use' flag is set in the
            extra flags
            
            fixed bug in object checking whereby DE would only check the first 16 flags in the anti2 vector
            when checking if an object was anti-all races
            
            replaced various references to 'bit's in error/reporting messages with 'flag's
            
            changed Unix '!' template key to '~', since '!' has been taken up by 'enter direct flag value'
            for quite some time now
            
            cleaned up setTemplateArgs, also fixed erroneous error messages that said there were 5 flag
            templates instead of 7
            
            updated win32's getkey() func to recognize F1-F12 and Shift+F1-Shift+F12
            
            fixed old bug whereby setting flags to a template value would not reposition the cursor at
            the menu prompt line, causing a direct flag entry ('!') to show the prompt in the wrong place
            
            added template support for all object and mob flags
            
            fixed bug in toggleVarCmd() whereby anything after the first arg wasn't cut out, resulting in
            being able to set a var with a space in the name
            
            fixed bug whereby you could set unsettable flags via templates
            
            fixed bug with referencing object/mob types in completion message after they've been deleted
            
            fixed bug under Unix with not displaying filler chars if bg is 0, causing garbage when
            backspacing on prompt
            
            removed Next and Last pointers from room record, started converting everything over - if indeed
            multiple zone support is ever added to DE, this will facilitate that, and it also makes the code
            cleaner and DE will take slightly less memory
            
            for checkForMobHeresofType and objhere, I could just rely on the 'loaded' list for the running
            through rooms sections
            
            removed rebuildRoomLookup() since it is now meaningless
            
            changed startInit() to call createRoom() so as to get any default room settings, changed
            main() to always init g_currentRoom (startInit() used to)
            
            changed various command-processing functions so that interpCommands() can return true when
            user quits and thereby allow DE to exit out of main() rather than whereever
            
            seems like I could remove some redundancy between which() and massSet()            
            
            updated code for lack of room Next/Last up to delroomu.cpp
            
            finished removal of Next/Last, looks like it works, haven't tested renumber yet though, should
            also test clone and grid
            
   7/2/06 - fixed up renumberRooms() so that it works, still need to test clone and grid
   
            removed Next pointer from objects, removed objHead
            
            seems like I could update resetAllObjHere() to update obj pointer as well as numb, as long as
            I updated g_objLookup[] first
            
            removal of Next pointer seems to have worked, need to check if clone obj works, clone room
            and grid for that matter too
            
            clone room, obj, and grid all look to work, ditto for renumbering objects
            
            fixed bug in list room, list obj, and list mob commands whereby lines was initialized to 0
            instead of 1, causing the first entry to possibly scroll off
            
            removed Next from mobTypes, all code appears to work
            
            quest and probably shop list do not allow listing by vnum as the other lists do
            
            due to changes can now replace roomPtr->roomNumber and obj->objNumber in myriad places
            
   7/4/06 - replaced ->roomNumber and ->objNumber everywhere
   
            fixed bug in massset whereby the wrong flag would have been (re)set for objects and mobs
            
            created checkForFlagExistence() to assist in removing redundant code between which and massset,
            will replace more in a wee bit
            
            created getFlagLocRoom/Obj/Mob for the same reason
            
            ditto getRoom/Obj/MobFlagPtr
            
            updating which and massSet should now be much more simple, and both functions became simpler
            regardless
            
            updated all function declarations in fh.h to use full argument names
            
            fixed more bugs with initializing line counter to 0 instead of 1, including checkPause()
            
            simplified checkForMob/ObjHeresofType by using loaded list rather than running through rooms and
            mobs manually
            
   7/5/06 - removed unused tables from common.c, simplified material list, it won't be hard for future
            people to fix it for straight Duris use
            
            cleaned up getMatchingObj() const and non-const versions
            
            similarly improved getMatchingMob() (has no const version)
            
            added 'closed' flag to zone flags, based on zone flag list that used to be in common.c
            
            removed const version of getMatchingObj() cuz it's pointless
            
   7/6/06 - fixed bug in del objh and del mobh whereby deleted objh/mobh was referenced after deletion
   
            cleaned up room editing so that vnum changing only resets things if you save the changes,
            removed need for 'origRoom' pointer, but I can't remember why the code works like it does as
            far as clearing 'associated' lists
            
            removed resetLowHighRoom() since it's not needed, altered deleteRoomUser() to figure it out
            easily enough on its own
            
            removed getNextRoomIgnoreHigh(), wasn't used anywhere
            
            fixed createKeywordList() so that more than one space between keywords doesn't result in
            'keywords' that are just a space
            
            I suspect there is a problem in deleteRoomInfo() with not resetting high/low, don't know that
            it matters as the code currently operates though
            
            deleteMobType() didn't call resetLowHighMob() or deleteEntityinLoaded(), though I don't think
            it mattered
            
            updated obj editing in the same way as room editing, still have origObj though until I fix it
            all up completely
            
            ditto for mob editing

   7/8/06 - changed editFlags() and displayEditFlags() functions to take entity type, name, and vnum, rather
            than generating the flag menu header in 349394 places
            
            expanded ENTITY_ list for zones, shops, quests, and rooms
            
            created getEntityTypeStrn() in master.cpp
            
            removed check for startx >= screen width in getStrn(), since startx is set from _gettextposition()
            and I trust my implementation (if someone sets their screenwidth variable below their actual
            screen width, the check could fail)
            
            changed displayEditFlags() to check if header is too long for screen width and automatically
            readjust it, removing need for myriad fix...Name calls before editFlags() calls
            
            should create 'getEndPointMaxWidthStrn()', something like that, which would run through a too-long
            string in reverse and return the point to stick the \0 char for the appropriate width..  someday
            
            renamed 'trapAff' in objectType rec to 'trapBits', updated all user refs to call them 'trap 
            flags', updated all other appropriate functions/flagdef list refs
            
            should also create a generic getMenuHeader() func which just says editing %s for %s #%s, might
            be able to just cut code out of displayEditFlags() and super-modularize
            
            created displayMenuHeader() and supporting funcs, put them in display.cpp, changed 
            displayFlagMenu() to call it
            
            fixed minor bug whereby getRoomSectorStrn() would append &n even if addColor was false
            
            altered base room editing menu to use new displayMenuHeader() func, I will update the rest shortly
            
            should also just remove all the new'ing of 'big' text blocks in entity editing
            
            all mob non-quest/shop menus are updated for new displayMenuHeader() code
            
            ditto for non-specific exit/edesc menus for rooms
            
            will need to make a displayComplexMenuHeader()-type func for exits and edescs, either that or
            just add more args to displayMenuHeader(), but that might make it too complicated
            
            created displaySimpleMenuHeader() for simple menus
            
            added origVnum arg to edit room/obj/mob menus so that you can change something's vnum back to
            what it was originally - actually, just using origObj/Mob in obj/mob for now until I update them
            not to suck
            
            there's a bug with setting vnum to high/low and then using jump keys that makes it abort out
            
            removed all new'ing of char[] blocks in display funcs
            
            improved 'edit exit state' menu so that you can only set a door to closed/locked if it has the
            right type, unless you have 'edit uneditable flags' set in which case you can do whatever you 
            want

            created displayMenuHeaderBasic() for those darn editing menus that are troublesome
            
            all editing menus are now updated for more modular code - all editing menus now set width of
            menu header properly based on screen width (or as best as possible for extra-tiny widths)
            
            readded APPLY_AC listing to displayObjApplyTypeList(), was removed long ago in the 'new armor'
            attempt and never readded
            
            created file editval.cpp, created func editStrnVal() and called from all editing menus where
            it made sense
            
            changed getStrn() so that it remembers the original colors and restores them when done
            
            created editUIntVal()
            
            updated edit zone menu for editUlong
            
            updated edit room vnum similarly, also changed interface a bit, should update obj and mob
            the same way
            
   7/9/06 - created editUIntValHelp(), editIntVal(), editLongValHelp(), editStrnValHelp()
   
            changed various exit info display funcs to only display 'open' if the exit actually has a
            door
            
            fixed bug in 'createedit exit' command whereby it simply wouldn't do anything - it looks to 
            me like this bug has been in DE since the very beginning
            
            replaced all 1995-98s in (C) bit with 1995-2006
            
            removed extra 'room', 'obj', 'mob', 'exit' from edit menus
            
            updated for uint/longval editing up to editmmsc.cpp, still need to do editflag.cpp also
            
            aborting editing a mob now resets the limit to its original value
            
            created getEntityOverride() to facilitate above
            
            aborting editing an obj also resets the limit
            
            changed applyModifier in objApplyRec from long to uint
            
            you can now search objects and skills from quest item editing menu
            
            created editFloatVal(), strfloat() for use in shop editing
            
            you can now search from 'items shop sells list' menu
            
            you can now search material list in obj editing
            
            you can now search apply types in obj editing
            
            you can now search from the 'create mobhere' prompt
            
            ditto for 'create objhere'
            
            fixed bug when creating new zone where you could go past the end of the zone name string
            by one character - would only mess up lifeLow, so not fatal
            
            you can now search from 'delete object/mob type/quest' prompts
            
            ditto for 'edit obj/mob/quest/shop' and 'goto room'
            
            removed various debug-style error messages, most of which I've never seen
            
            added search to mob species editing
            
            removed EQ_RESALIGN from mobhere.h, since there are no longer any anti-align bits, and
            everything else related
            
            could make a generic 'display list' func, would fit for a few functions
            
  7/10/06 - implementing better room editing code, it looks to work and is more straightforward, ditto for
            edit room extra desc and edit exit code
  
            removed further useless error messages
            
            more destruction of silly shit from source commentary
            
            created displayList() for displaying a searchable list of things, updated 
            displayMaterial/Skill/Spell/ObjApplyTypeList()
            
            changed main() to create g_apply_types_low[] list at start time with lowercase apply types,
            so that getObjApplyTypeStrn() doesn't have to take a char * arg and so that apply type list
            can change in common.c and not break DE proper
            
            at the very least, need to fix jumping after changing vnum bugs before releasing this version
            of DE, I'd also like to fix the wacky obj and mob editing too

            should add better support for defroom with exits, including copying explicitly created exits
            in walkcreate/create room prompt over default room exits and keeping exits in copydef room and
            whereever else - could make it a configurable option
            
            removed deleteRoomAssocLists() since it's not used anymore
            
            also probable bug if you change a container object's vnum, then you can change its type even
            if it is loaded somewhere (vnum change not fully registered)
            
  7/11/06 - updated displayList() to take another func arg and displayMobSpeciesList() to use new 
            displayList(), and two new functions to obtain mob species name and code by number
            
            fixed afore-mentioned container editing bug
            
            changed obj editing so that changes in obj flags making eq unwearable are only checked if user
            accepts object changes at the very end, which also required that all editing happen on the actual
            obj and the copy be used in case user aborts rather than other way around, but object flag
            editing is now much cleaner
            
            set object to two-handed after two were already equipped as one-handers, eq pos was still as
            normal one-handers so nothing was detected, but when the zone was later reloaded the eq'ing
            code assumed it should be in the two-handed slot, so the other sword got bumped because not
            enough hands.  the question is, do i care?  the best i could do is check if eq in the wield
            slot is two-handed and treat it as two-handed..  duris would have the same problem
            
            eliminated editrflg.cpp, editoflg.cpp, editofl2.cpp, and editmflg.cpp completely, each function 
            had one line
            
            updated mob editing in the same way as obj editing
            
            created editKeywords() func, called from all appropriate menus
            
            simplified deleteExtraDescUser() by just refreshing the entire screen from the caller, which
            obj edesc deletion already did anyway, so what was the point, there was none, ehh.
            
            todo - fix jump, change default room handling so that exits stick around and new exits replace
            def exits in walkcreate/'create room' mode - when user executes 'copy defr' command, ask them
            if they want to copy any exits into the defroom
            
  7/12/06 - fixed room/obj/mob/quest/shop jumping (although for quest and shop it's more like just unifying
            with the others)
            
            altered code so that default room can have exits, user is prompted if he wants to copy exits
            into defroom when using copy defr command, and new exits replace any defroom exits when 
            'create r'ing and walkcreate'ing
            
  7/13/06 - moved writing container contents to right after writing the object load command in 
            writeAllObjInside() instead of after writing all in list - this bug would have caused the
            last container of a particular vnum in a list to get filled rather than whichever one was
            actually filled - a list being a room object list or mob inventory list
            
            problem - if an object has edescs, no master node is created for it in createMasterList(),
            so that if it has keywords different from any of its edescs, it will not be look'able by the
            object keywords
            
            fixed mismatched %u and %d's in various zone file read/write funcs - readzon.cpp uses long
            when reading random load values instead of uint, but there's too many and I just don't care
            
            eliminated editzflg.cpp, forgot about that one

  7/14/06 - further refined zone 'put command' writing to write non-containers first and then containers,
            so that if you have a 'bp in bp' situation the contents are written as closely as possible to
            what the zone writer intended - if you go crazy with same vnum containers inside themselves,
            you can still get situations where it's impossible to replicate the original structure, but I've
            done all I can
            
  7/15/06 - fixed bug in 'setrandom' command whereby you could not set the rand %age on a mob by keyword
            
            fixed bug in master node creation whereby an object with keywords that didn't match any of its
            edescs was not look'able/random'able by keyword
            
            created addMasterNodeToList, called from createMasterList() to make it cleaner
            
  7/16/06 - fixed bug where g_madeChanges was set any time you went to 'edit exits' menu
  
            fixed bug where sometimes you couldn't edit some exits in 'edit exits' menu
            
            if you had a new zone with a room created from a default room, the master/editable list would
            not be created for that room, making any room edescs initially unrecognizable for editing/looking
            by keyword
            
            DE now displays map view if either ISMAPZONE var is set or zone's 'map' flag is set
            
            simplified new zone init by allowing createRoom() to handle vnum limit/table updating
            
            need to add proper quiver support - how it works is, you can only put the missile type specified
            in val[2], and val[3] keeps track of the number just for ease of checking, and # of missiles can't
            exceed val[0].  easy.  when writing the zone, auto-set val[3] for any single instance of a
            quiver, and if a quiver has more than one instance and they don't all match up in # of missiles,
            then complain
            
            wrote code to allow you to 'put all' into quiver properly, but now I'm not sure if Duris itself
            even supports putting missiles into quivers with zone load commands, I've sent a PM off to
            Tharkun and will wait to see what he says
            
            did fix bug where if you 'put all' while not carrying anything you wouldn't see anything, though
            
            started basic canPutObjectInQuiver function because I'll need it in a few places, will finish it
            later
            
  7/26/06 - added BSD-type license to every source file that I wrote, created license.txt
  
            yanked start of 'put things in quivers' code because I just don't care
            
            moved displayMap() function to specific map.cpp file so that I can just say that map.cpp is
            wholly derived directly from Duris source and stick BSD header on look.cpp
            
            removed editrsec.cpp and editRoomSector() since it was one line
            
            attempting to drop/take all when there is nothing to drop/take now shows a message instead of
            nothing
            
   8/1/06 - ditched any semblance of Watcom support, deleted system.cpp and shell and freestack and misc
            others
            
   8/6/06 - removed unnecessary libraries from Win32 version, manifest too, removed shell and freestack from
            documentation
            
  8/14/06 - created readAreaFileLine(), performs many of the redundant tasks performed time and time again
            in readwld, readmob, etc., also created a couple of others that add functionality occasionally
            used
            
            updated readwld for new func
            
            changed createKeywordList() to support no tilde at the end
            
            updated readmob for new func
            
            setting a new random load %age on an obj or mob would not set g_madeChanges
            
            updated readobj, readzon, readqst, readshp for new func
            
  8/15/06 - explicitly defined all common menu keys, made CR/Esc footer less extraneously verbose
  
            wrote displayMenu(), looks good, updated editRoom() to support it
            
            TRAP_EFF_* flag definitions did not match positions in flagDef list, changed definitions
            to match list, not sure which is correct though
            
            updated editObjectType()
            
            updated editMobType()
            
            updated editZone()
            
            updated 'stat zone' command to show zone flags
            
            you could "edit shop #" and create shop from that prompt on mobs that were loaded more than
            once
            
            DE wasn't setting g_madeChanges when creating a shop from 'edit shop' command
            
            updated editExtraDesc()
            
            updated editExit()
            
            could update editrexd.cpp, editoexd.cpp, editrext.cpp to at least some degree
            
            implemented right-side menu (all previous were inline), updated editrmsc.cpp with this type
            
            updated editomsc.cpp similarly
            
            made new code more efficient by moving menu init to global so that the values are hardcoded into 
            the .EXE rather than always being reset on each call to the display() func
            
  8/16/06 - changed 'choiceMore' data to just use a pointer to an array of more menuChoices, added more
            to menuChoice as necessary
  
            an option for right-side menus is to not use arrays of choices, and just always assume one
            choice per letter
            
            updated menu code for new data structures, makes things simpler to update
            
            updated obj misc #2, trap, mob misc 1-3, zone misc menus
            
  8/17/06 - updated shop menu
  
            defined displayMenuFooter(), now called from all old-style menus
            
            also should add another var or two to menus to allow for more flexibility
            
            updated shop messages menu, shop opening/closing time, racist, booleans menu, quest item
            menu
            
  8/18/06 - updated main check menu
  
            updated right-side menu to adjust position of values based on max option length
            
            updated misc, mob, obj, room check, config, display menu
            
            added missing options to 'set all check options on/off' option and one in misc somewhere
            
            created displayMenuNoFooter(), updated editExit() as much as possible
            
            updated editObjExtraDescs(), editRoomExtraDescs(), editShopBought(), editShopSold(), quest
            editing functions
            
  8/19/06 - changed all non-keyword MAX_LEN defines to be size without terminating null, rather than size
            with
            
            added intMaxLen var to menuChoice
            
            changed max length of zone name to 128 from 80
            
            created interpretMenu, editMenuValue, for true generic menu goodness (closer to it anyway)
            
            added mctDescription type
            
            created editDesc(), placed in editdesc.cpp, removed editRoomDesc(), will remove similar
            functions A.S.A.P.
            
            added other types and so forth
            
            edit room menu is now largely handled by editMenuValues()
            
            ditto room misc
            
            updated main obj menu
            
            fixed a couple of bugs in aborting editing obj edescs when you've added an ID edesc to an 
            object that didn't have one before, making me wonder if I ever tested the code..  it probably
            worked under DOS
            
            updated all types for sint, uchar, uint, usint
            
            replaced all ulong with uint
            
            updated obj misc #2 menu
            
            created more stuff in menu.cpp for modular goodness - related to verbose searchable lists like
            obj material
            
            removed needless addedIdentKeyword param from interpEditObjTypeMenu
            
  8/20/06 - defined displayAnyKeyPrompt and displayYesNoPrompt, employed in various places, not everywhere
  
            updated obj misc menu
            
            updated obj trap menu
            
            original trap level wasn't being restored on aborting
            
            updated main mob menu
            
            created editUIntValSearchableList, editMenuValueListVerbose now calls that
            
            updated mob misc, misc #2, misc #3 menu
            
            created editDieStrnVal, mctDieString, applied to mobs
            
            created editStrnValSearchableList
            
            changed linkroom behavior so that existing exits get their destination room reset rather
            nothing
            
            replaced all appropriate code with displayPromptYesNo
            
  8/21/06 - updated shop message menu, along with some new mct types and editing functions
  
            replaced use of array subscripts in checkDieStrnValidity and checkDieStrnValidityShort with
            pointer incrementation
            
            updated shop menu, added buy/sell mult types and editing funcs
            
            updated shop booleans, open/close time, racist menu
            
            updated zone menu, zone misc menu, extra desc menu
            
  8/22/06 - started updating quest item menu
  
  8/24/06 - updated quest item menu
  
            updated check, config, display menus
            
            updated quest message menu
            
            updated quest quest menu
            
  8/25/06 - updated edit shop sold menu to use editUIntValSearchableList
  
            replaced various editStrnVal() and editUIntVal() calls with editStrn/UIntValSearchableList
            
            changed display room list func to upstrn room search string itself rather than rely on outside
            
            created editIntValHelpSearch and editIntValSearchableList to replace a few prompts
            
            g_madeChanges is only set if override limit on obj/mob is actually changed
            
            updated exit menu
            
            added displayType to menuChoice and defined obj values as not listing list values inline

            updated inline menus to respect screen width
            
            altered Win32 clrscr() to clear entire buffer with color.. I'm not sure what I was thinking with
            the previous code
            
            updated version to 2.99d
            
  8/29/06 - old-style command list mem usage for 'asdf' zone - 5728k
  
            fixed crash bug when deleting a mob type - accessing deleted mob record
            
            changed 'delete unused' command to delete mob types first so as to clear out any quest/shop obj
            references and therefore perhaps gain new unused objects
            
            changed command struct to not have Next pointer, removed addCommand(), altered other functions
            
            removed initcomm.cpp, added cmddef.cpp
            
            removed pointless exit arg from goDirection()
            
            all command lists are now generated at compile-time as 0-terminated arrays
            
            mem usage is now 5270k - 8k
            
            another problem in Win32 clrscr() was using unsigned short to store result of short * short
            
            invalid start room vnum in .set file would cause a crash
            
            npc_class_bits/race_names initialization was bad - was putting end zero entry one past actual
            end.  didn't matter for npc_class_bits because it was too big anyway and globals are 
            0-initialized, but whatever was after race_names was getting zero'd..  guess it didn't matter
            
  8/30/06 - commented aff5 var out of objectType
  
            reworked check to not require global tmpCheck FILE * for 'pause every screenful of check errors'
            
            object craftsmanship was being checked twice
            
   9/3/06 - added 'maxvnum' command, used to adjust maximum vnum from inside DE
   
            when reading .wld, .obj, and .mob file, limit is now automatically adjusted if vnum is too high
            
            DE now aborts when reading a non-default room/obj/mob with a vnum of 0
            
            changed createRoom, createObj, createMob to automatically increase limit if necessary, removed
            all appropriate 'use ll= switch' messages
            
            changed grid creation, cloning, and renumbering to also readjust top automatically
            
   9/7/06 - replaced redundant auto-vnum-reset-handling code with changeMaxVnumAutoEcho()
   
            added (nothrow) arg to all new calls since i use NULL return val from new for bad alloc, not
            bad_alloc exception - DE would just die on a failed new without it
            
            fixed uninitialized zone numb in setZoneNumbPrompt(), which was causing garbage in initial 
            input text instead of current zone numb
            
            g_madeChanges var is now only set if you actually change the zone number
            
   9/9/06 - current time to renumber rooms with new zone, grid 30 30 30, standard directions, then 
            renumber 30000 -> 95 + 95
            
            using exit pointer instead of subscript in resetExits() -> 95 + 94
            
            unrolling exit loop -> 96 + 95
            
            at least I tried..  leaving the code with exit pointers and loop for max ease of updating -
            though the compiler already optimizes to walking a pointer and unrolling the loop
            
            fixed bug in renumbering whereby tempstart was not being set high enough to clear new high
            limit, which would inadvertently clear room/obj/mob pointers out of the lookup table in the
            right circumstances
            
            fixed bug with not setting initial input string in 'goto' prompt
            
            fixed bug with not setting initial input value in room/obj/mob/quest/shop jump prompts
            
            removed mobNumb arg from jumpQuest/jumpShop, room/obj/mob ptr from jumpRoom/Obj/Mob
            
  9/13/06 - changed changeMaxVnum() to only memset new tables if new is bigger than old, and then to
            only clear the new empty part
            
  9/30/06 - altering DE so it will compile under 64-bit without any problems

            DE has been so altered, still need to test actual compilation under 64-bit systems though
            
            compilation has been tested and verified, though execution has not - but it should work (heh heh)
            
            when statting a mob that had a large number of classes, DE would probably crash - string used
            to hold class names was too short
            
            fixed minor issues with displaying things as signed/unsigned in stat room/obj/mob
            
            mob hometown was displayed as unsigned in menus even though it's signed
            
            fixed display bug whereby hitting 'Q' in stat zone wouldn't add new linefeeds so prompt
            would be on new line
            
  10/7/06 - fixed bug whereby you couldn't load anything out of a directory other than the directory DE
            was run from, basically.  you see, the SET MAINZONENAME command was being processed in .SET
            files, due to the args not always being uppercased anymore.  whoops.
            
            fixed up createMasterKeywordList() to properly create list for correct object snagging with
            dot numbering
            
            'reset object condition' command would set g_madeChanges regardless of whether any changes were
            made or not
            
            added error handling for failed setString() to all callers, changed setString() itself to not
            try to copy into NULL on failed alloc
            
            removed pointless error-checking code from addCommand()
            
  10/8/06 - cleaned up failed mem alloc code - only exit(1) if absolutely necessary, clean up in
            creategrid(), and return existing head for list copying so that memory isn't irrevocably lost -
            the most notable change is probably in allocating pairedExitNodes in write zone, so that you
            can always save in low mem situations
            
            changed deleteRoomInfo() to reset low/high vnum, fixes bugs in low-mem failed grid creation and
            aborting 'create room' room creation half-way
            
            exits in default room .DWD file would add to g_numbExits counter
            
            creating/deleting exits in def room no longer alters g_numbExits
            
            fixed potential overflow in edesc ID display in menus
            
            removed fixString() and fixStringColor() and all related
            
            defined MAX_ZONEFILE_EXTRA_SPACES, obj-inside-obj indentation can never go over this
            
            every object short name var in writeZoneFiles() was one char short, ditto for mob short name,
            caused a crash for me with super-long names, apparently when writing 'give mob' command
            
            bumped version up to 2.99de
            
            created displayAllocError(), called from all appropriate places
            
            created ENTITY_ZONE_LINE entity type and altered readAreaFileLine() calls so that zone reading 
            will again report the line # that couldn't be fully read due to being too long or premature EOF
            
            simplified getVerboseCanEquipStrn() by calling existing error message funcs and creating slot
            string table
            
 10/10/06 - removed EQ_NOHANDS, equipment code was wrong anyway, would have prevented using objs in certain
            circumstances when it shouldn't have
            
            de-redundatized EQ_WRONGRACE/EQ_RACECANTUSE checking by creating eqRaceRestrict() and calling from
            two duplicative regions
            
            removed room * arguments from various functions that always got passed g_currentRoom, changed 
            functions to just use g_currentRoom
            
 10/11/06 - fixed bug in findMobHere() that only would have found matching mobs in your current room or the
            room afterwards - only affected goto and at commands
            
            removed room * arguments from many other functions
            
            testing would be good, particularly findObjHere/findMobHere() callers
            
 10/12/06 - testing successful
 
 10/14/06 - getNumbFreeRooms() would count low by one if the last possible vnum wasn't occupied - this only
            mattered for createGrid() and even then it would have just resized the array, but a bug is a bug
            
            changed 'key' command to allow 'key'ing for objects that are not of type key, also fixed issue
            with not counting enough lines for header when doing 'key <vnum/keyword>'
            
            added explicit 'Press a key to exit' display for Win32 since otherwise people might be confused
            
            replaced calls to itoa() with sprintf() since it seems only semi-supported - there were two!,
            removed itoa()-like function from unixgraph.cpp
            
 11/27/06 - removed coords var and gettextpos() call from startInit()
 
  1/21/07 - changed arctic color code from exactly like desert to cyan background, bright cyan foreground
  
  1/31/07 - created displayReadAreaFileLineEntityInfo for redundant display in readFile functions
  
            fixed bug in fixStringNodes() that would have prevented removal of end lines that were only
            spaces
            
            changed arctic sector to '.' instead of ' '
            
   2/8/07 - updated DE to properly support affect3 'has four arms' flag

  3/26/07 - fixed getMobHereEquipSlot() to properly respect a valid 'where' position, which matters when
            interpreting zone 'equip mob' commands, because before DE would just stick a multi-wear-flagged
            item into whatever free slot happened to fit first instead of where the zone creator had wanted
            
            removed 'notFound' pointer arg from all getVar* funcs since it wasn't used

  3/29/07 - defined getMobSpeciesNoColorStrn(), called from displayMobMisc() so that the vowelization is proper
   
  3/31/07 - created non-const version of displayColorString() that can take a string of any length, and that is
            more efficient than the const version
            
            changed g_roomSectList[] to contain colors, changed getRoomSectorStrn() to not use its own color
            table - now the sector editing menu has colors
            
            added color to liquid types
            
            removed addColor arg from getRoomSectorStrn() since it was never false
            
            changed remColorCodes() to take any size string, be faster, and actually only remove completely
            valid Duris codes
            
            updated all (c) 1995-2006s to 1995-2007
            
            changed getStrn() to not create a separate buffer for editing - but since I often call getStrn()
            with strn and oldStrn args pointing to the same string, I created another version of getStrn()
            that does create a separate buffer that stores the original string and made the original getStrn()
            check for this condition and call the new version if necessary.  this way, the 'real' version
            of getStrn() no longer has an arbitrary size limit, and callers can still let getStrn() handle
            the 'old value' buffer if they want
            
            changed dispGetStrnField() to take non-const strn and to alter strn with a temporary null rather 
            than allocating a new string and copying over
            
   4/2/07 - removed warning for obsolete 'weapon damage' value (val3 for ITEM_WEAPON) in 'check' command
   
   4/5/07 - added check for shop closing time before/equal to opening time
   
            added menu data type and menu code to not allow user to enter shop closing time less than or equal
            to open time and vice versa
            
  4/21/07 - created strlefti(), which is strleft() except that it ignores case
  
            changed getCommandPositions() to not allocate extra string sized the same as the input string,
            also made it generally faster
            
            allowed spaces after semicolons in prompt input..  before, they would cause commands not to match
            
            changed checkCommands to take pointer arg used to store command # that matched - can be NULL
            
            changed checkCommands to not execute anything if a NULL execCommand ptr is passed
            
            changed checkCommands to use strlefti() rather than strleft()
            
            created strcmpnocase(), which is strcmp() except it ignores case
            
            changed checkCommands to use strcmpnocase() rather than strcmp()
            
            aliases now work properly with semicolons and without a string being alloc'd/dealloc'd every
            interpCommand() call
            
            changed addAlias() to use strcmpnocase() and therefore was able to remove various upstrns
            
            changed addAlias() even better to use strncpy() to cut off too-long strings, thereby allowing
            me to remove yet more local string vars
            
            changed all var funcs to ignore case in variable name - this allowed me to get rid of various
            upstrn()s and temp vars just in the var funcs, much less the calling funcs which i shall alter
            shortly
            
            changed all the variable names to use alternating case LikeThisYouSee for readability
            
            addAliasArgs() no longer always uppercases the name of the alias
            
            checkAliases() now ignores case when looking for aliases, thus allowing non-uppercased aliases
            
            setExecCommandFile() no longer uses extra string to uppercase, removing potential overflow should
            someone get confused
            
            unalias command didn't set g_madeChanges when deleting an alias
            
            wrote strstrnocase()
            
            changed displayList() to not uppercase searchStrn etc, thus removed one local string var
            
            similarly altered displayObjectTypeList(), displayRoomList()
            
            whichFlag() no longer requires a magical internal var
            
            which() and massSet() no longer upstrn input
            
            changed scanKeyword() to use strcmpnocase and createKeywordList() to not uppercase anything
            
            removed upstrn() of args in mainExecCommand() - this may break a few things
            
            fixed which/massset after above change
            
            fixed look
            
            changed checkArgs to not copy anything and require a seperate string and use case insensitivity
            and similarly changed preCheckArgs
            
            strleft() is no longer used
            
            prompt 'default' val no longer has to be all lowercase
            
            created strrighti() and changed interpEditConfigMenu to call that, now strright() is no longer used
            
            changed unaliasCmd() to ignore case on alias name
            
            created compareStringNodesIgnoreCase(), changed various compare funcs to call it when comparing
            keyword lists
            
            replaced various calls to strcmp with strcmpnocase
            
            removed local vars, calls to upstrn from displayCommandList()
            
            also many other removals of upstrn(), all of them excellent
            
            removed call to upstrn() in searchObjValue()
            
            changed file reading funcs to allow lowercase letters in extra desc letters, quest command letters,
            etc
            
            created strcmpnocasecount and strlefticount, which only check strn for count chars
            
            changed checkCommands() to not require any local temp strings by using the aforementioned funcs.
            i also removed the 'notrimtrailing' since checkcommands doesn't trim anything anymore, and it
            doesn't matter
            
            removed a 257-byte local string var from interpCommands
            
            i could remove a further 32k chunk from interpCommands by having a pointer into strn and placing
            and removing null chars for each semicolon-seperated command..  sadly i need at least one big-ass
            buffer since vars and aliases are being expanded
            
            simplified const version of displayColorString by simply copying const strn arg into local non-
            const strn and passing it to the better version.  the const func was already copying the string
            anyway, and since it was byte by byte the library strcpy() is likely faster and so it's a winner
            on all fronts
            
  4/22/07 - benchmarked simplified version of const displayColorString, it is indeed slightly faster than the
            old version.  i win
            
            also sped up displayColorString some more by caching show/interp var vals rather than looking them
            up over and over
            
            hmm with an early non-benchmarked loop to get everything cached, and altering the old code to cache
            the variable values, they are pretty much the same speed.  but at least now the code is simpler..
            the const version wasn't as hip anyway
            
            for interp i suspect i can just replace all the semicolons with null chars and then use the posArr
            values as indexes into the strn pointer
            
            replaced calls to strstr() in editable and master keyword dot-matching funcs with strchr() since
            it's probably slightly faster
            
            removed pointless upfirstarg() and remLeadingSpaces() before calling checkCommands, now upfirstarg
            is not used
            
            improved checkAliases() such that a 32k buffer is no longer needed and it should be slightly faster
            
            removed 512-byte buffer from at() as well as pointless remLeading and other code
            
            i actually can't remove another 32k buffer from interpCommands because the string is interpreted
            twice, and hey why not
            
            removed need for 512-byte searchStrn in displayQuestList
            
            ditto for displayShopList
            
            removed unnecessary var val copy in isVarBoolean(), made various other minor efficiency 
            improvements in var.cpp
            
  4/22/07 - i updated all the archives and rebuilt the linux version and uploaded them all, then realized
            that the 'unvar' command also wasn't setting g_madeChanges when deleting a variable, but i'm not
            going to update everything again..  i'll do it later
    
  4/29/07 - 
  
    it should be easy to change the alias/variable expansion code to take a 'max string length' arg, then
    just replace alias/var names as long as they exist until the max length is hit, this causes aliases/vars
    to be expanded until the limits of reality are struck.
    
    this would require the checkAlias() and replaceVarArg() funcs to take a max length and to also return
    a value when they have not replaced anything, since if anything is replaced another loop will be necessary,
    don't need feedback for when max length is hit since you'd still want to replace things because why not,
    except this could still cause an infinite loop, like if $blah = $asdf, and $asdf = $blah, but for that i
    can just have a counter, and if the counter hits some magical value i.e. the max length, pop up a message
    saying 'probable infinite loop, alias/variable expansion aborted'
    
    this shall also require two strings of the max length, at the start expand the command string into max 
    length string #1, then expand #1 into max length #2, then #2 into #1, etc.
    
            changed name of checkAliases() to expandAliasesAndVariables() since that's what the function
            actually does
            
            changed expandAliasesAndVariables() to take intMaxLen var
            
            changed expandAliasesAndVariables() again to take src and dest string, this enables me to
            not have yet another magically limited string and also enables me to remove a strcpy()
            
            semi-updated expandAliasesAndVariables()/interpCommands() sort of works but not really..  maybe
            i will need a strcpy after all, it seems like i shouldn't though..  one possible cause of error
            is that expandAliases.. is always called twice regardless of whether it should be which usually
            it shouldn't
            
  4/29/07 - after sleeping..  removed pointless local 32k string and strcpy in expandAliasArgs(),
            changed expand alias/var funcs to return a bool that is true if they expanded anything
            
            added check for excess expansion, but it goes extra-slowly probably because..
            
            i think i need to have a third string in interpCommands() now, either that or remove the initial
            stage..  the thing is that the semicolon-seperated string has to remain untouched until all
            processing is complete, but i might get a semicolon string from the first alias pass..  so i'll
            need three buffers..  but since i removed the pointless string from expandAliasArgs() i guess it
            all works out
            
            
            new technique for command interpreting - just have source string and dest string, copy into dest
            string as necessary, stop when there is no more processing, copy only up to semicolon/null, use
            null char replacement technique, feed into checkCommand when all in chunk is replaced, only
            requires two buffers, feed from incoming string->strn1 first, then swap between buffers after that.
            will need to track number of commands executed, for aliases that reference other aliases inside
            semicolon blocks
            
            this will also allow for variable dereferencing from the prompt..  can't hurt
            
            can now create alias/var with 'create' command and delete with 'delete' command
            
 5/4/2007 - created getVarStrnLen()
 
            changed getVarStrn to take maxLen arg and use strncpy() to only copy that much
            
            created simpler version of getVarStrn that doesn't take strn or maxLen arg
            
            made everything after set command get passed as args just like alias command
            
            started work on new interpreter, but i am confused by how exactly to implement it..  it sort of
            works, you can dereference variables from the prompt now, but variable looping refs make it crash
            even though it should work and aliases probably don't work
            
            at any rate i am unsure how to implement the new technique to fully unroll everything properly.
            i will figure it out later.
            
            wait, why not just expand it out completely at the very start, then go from there.  easy.  i'll
            write it later
            
 5/5/2007 - new technique mostly works, just need to readd alias recognition and expansion
 
            created aliasExists() func, strangely this never existed before
            
            similarly created getAlias() func
            
            changed expandAliasArgs to take intMaxLen arg and return how many characters it added
            
            changed getArg() to take intMaxLen arg and to take intCopied pointer, which can be NULL, created
            version of getArg() that only takes 4 args and uses NULL intCopied
            
            reworked expandAliasArgs to not suck as bad
            
            updated everything for new getArg()
            
            fixed probable potential overflow in grabbing args for cloneExecCommand
            
            new command interp all basically works now, except i think the max length detection isn't quite
            right
            
            created subZeroFloor() to subtract two unsigned numbers and return 0 if the second is bigger than
            the first
            
            fixed crash by checking len every time and returning out if too big
            
            reduced max expanded prompt input len to 1024, which is probably still overkill, but at least it's
            not 32768
            
            removed calls to subZeroFloor() in processUserInput since now I don't need it
            
            fixed a problem in mainExecCommand where the inargs were just being copied into args, which
            happened to be too small but which also should have been using strncpy()..  i wonder why this was
            never a problem before
            
            the interpreter looks airtight to me now and the internal buffers for interp command are now 
            1/32nd as large and other things became safer too!!!!!!!!!!
            
            uploaded this version to Jollython

            changed WriteConsole() to only dump large buffers in 65535 chunks and removed needless error
            check for 64-bit systems..  the 65535 byte limit is an API restriction that I never noticed.
            happily this made DE.exe 12k smaller, I guess because of the extra string literal I removed
            which I suppose just pushed it over some boundary..  either that or _outtext is highly inline'd
            by the compiler, EXCEPT that removing the other cout didn't do anything.  and also Mabort is
            the one who pointed this out to me on the Duris forums
                
 5/6/2007 - started converting all global var names to have g_ prefix - got a lot of them but there are
            more, and it's possible i missed a few somewhere, though i don't think so, but who knows, eh?
            
            changed checkPause to take strn arg and call numbLinesStringNeeds() itself, since all but one
            caller did that anyway
            
            removed 3 unnecessary checkPause() calls from where()
            
            updated all global var names
            
            changed drop command to not allow dropping a shop mob in a room that already has one
            
            added help screen that shows up on -? --help -h /? /-help /h
            
            removed first clrscr() in main(), since it theoretically should cause a crash under ncurses
            since ncurses isn't initialized yet but i suppose ncurses just exits out without doing anything
            because it knows it isn't initialized, regardless, i removed it
            
            under Win32, 'press any key to exit...' func is only set right before reading zone files instead
            of while setting up console, thus avoiding prompt when -?'ing or aborting with no command line
            args
            
 5/7/2007 - changed setVarArgs() to work better, faster, stronger - also fixed bug whereby garbage would have
            been dumped to the screen on a var alloc error
            
            removed loadFromTable arg and associated code, someone else can implement someday if they want,
            the tiny bit of code that was there was outdated
            
            made zone door state code/error messages more clear
            
            ditto for some other zone loading errors, they now also all show on what line number the error
            occurred
            
            started replacing cout with _outtext, moved unix init to same place as Win32 init, removed 
            cursesInit and associated code from unixgraph.cpp
            
            replaced all occurrences of 'roomNode' with 'roomPtr'
            
            similarly objNode and mobNode
            
            converted all couts to sprintf and _outtext except in readmob.cpp and readobj.cpp because the
            task is growing tiresome
            
            replaced all .OBJ with .obj, .MOB with .mob, etc
            
            replaced all cout references, DE became 28k smaller.  sweet
            
            fixed addAlias() to do strncpy() on alias replacement..  it already did on alias creation.
            whoops
            
 5/8/2007 - removed global g_display by adding args to appropriate alias/var/limit funcs etc etc
 
            replaced all "\0" with ""
            
            made addAliasArgs() better, safer, stronger, faster
            
            fixed expandAliasArgs() to stick bad '%X' pairs into dest string instead of just skipping them
            
            display string length in toggleVar wasn't long enough for the longest vars, fortunately it only
            overwrote the args string
            
            created ensureShopValueIsNumeric() and ensureShopValueIsYorN() for many redundant checks in
            shop-reading code
            
            added code to wait for keypress in at-exit func for Unix since otherwise you lose any errors 
            that might cause an exit because ncurses restores screen
            
            changed Unix version to printf arg help and delay ncurse init until after arg help
            
            fixed bug whereby !'d string wouldn't be expanded
            
            unified all the code in 'write zone file' funcs, just because i can and because in some cases
            i made it .3% more efficient
            
 5/9/2007 - changed Win32 to not erase any existing zone files when creating new but rather only overwrite them
            if the user saves - it still warns if using an existing zone name
            
            related to above, removed g_zoneLoadedWithQuest/Shop vars and changed writeFiles() to do the same
            sort of thing the default file handler already did, which was to try to remove existing files
            regardless of whether DE thinks the zone had them at load
            
            created error display funcs for redundant R/G-line code in .qst file reading
            
            for .inv reading/writing - .inv format can use zone commands, writing should be easy, reading
            can use existing zone reading funcs with some alterations, will need to make a 'takeEntityBase'
            func or the like that just takes a void * and a type, and one for put, but that will require a
            separate 'last loaded' list for .inv, but that's not so tough..  whee.  still a bit of work though
            
5/11/2007 - actually, better .inv format would be to use a format similar to .ZON files but better..  each
            command that loads a new object or mob gives that mob or object a unique (implied) ID, and then
            put/equip commands use those IDs.  the header of the .inv file specifies how many IDs to allocate,
            because that's fun times.  never mind, no pre-amount, why bother
            
            sample format:
            
              *** DE inventory file v1    ; magic header, specifies version
              M
              356 75          ; put mob #356 in inventory, rand % is 75, implied ID is 0
              O 
              392 100         ; put obj #392 in inv, 100% rand, ID is 1
              P
              454 100 1       ; put obj #454 in ID 1, which is obj #392, ID is 2
              E
              123 100 0 5     ; equip obj #123 to pos 5 of ID 0, which is mob #356, positions are same as .zon,
                              ; ID is 3
              P
              397 100 0       ; put obj #397 in ID 0, which is mob #356's inventory, ID is 4
              S               ; end token, why not
            
            that should cover everything
            
            started work on inventory writing code
            
            i just realized the EDITABLE_ #defines are never used, so i've deleted them
            
            created getZoneCommandEquipPos() for changing the high DE-only wear positions into Duris-ready
            wear positions, it is called from writezon.cpp and writeInventoryMobEquip..()
            
            it looks like the inventory writing works
            
            changed 'get all' so that it always picks up mobs as well
            
            started writing inventory reading code
            
            finished inventory reading code, i think it works
            
            created void displayAnyKeyPromptNoClr(), doesn't clear current line
            
            now that inventory is saved, changed all successful takes to set madeChanges
            
            uploaded this version to Jollython
            
5/12/2007 - changed name of takeEntity() to takeEntityCmd(), started work on takeEntityObj() and Mob() to
            remove redundancy and inconsistencies
            
            wrote takeEntityObj(), called appropriately..  it even works.  i wonder why i didn't do this
            earlier
            
            wrote takeEntityMob()
            
            rewrote both takeAll() funcs to use new funcs
            
            removed entityOwner from editableNode since it was never used
            
            rewrote takeEntityFromEntity() for new funcs, sadly it crashes on some case or another
            
            ah, it was buffer overrun when taking extra-long objs from extra-long containers
            
            take code is now more efficient and less wacky in its happenings, i.e. it is easier to understand,
            and it also fixes the inconsistency whereby you could get all and get copies of shop mobs, at least
            i'm pretty sure that was in there - i shall soon update all other code similarly
            
            oh yeah also 'drop' had a bug whereby dropping all would always clear your inventory.  whoops
            
            fixed bug that i just introduced whereby you could never non-dropc a mob in a room with a shop.
            also, you could always dropc shop mobs in rooms with shops.  doh and double doh.
            
            code would not check if a room had more than one shop loaded, also changed shop checking funcs
            a bit to be more clear as to when they are called
            
            similarly fixed load command to not allow loading a shop mob in a room that already has one
            
            drop is now updated much like take
            
            started work on put, but i'm tired and i'll fix it up later
            
5/13/2007 - rewrote put, removing much redundant code

            reworked equip to remove excessive string literals, but also should rework equipMobSpecific() to
            receive the target mob rather than having the same checks twice
            
            removed echoIt args and code from equipping funcs since it was always true
            
            cleaned up equip code, can now equip existing items by vnum rather than always loading a new one
            
            changed checkPause to check length of string before pausing, this also means checkPause now
            calls displayColorString() itself, which makes sense anyway
            
            'list commands' is now another way to do the 'commands' command
            
            fixed up checkEditableList() to be faster and clearer and use less memory
            
            inventory now displays container contents and things carried by mobs, as well as mob equipment
            and things inside mob equipment
            
            changed 'look' and 'look in' commands to run through all contained containers, and to display
            contents of containers in mob's inventory and equipment

5/14/2007 - changed inventory, 'look mob', 'look obj', and 'look in obj' code to pause every screenful

            changed 'equip' command to only create an objHere if the mob can definitely equip it
            
5/15/2007 - added global vars for default extra desc, quest, shop

            removed using namespace std; from all source files, added std:: to the places i needed it
            
            wrote readExtraDesc(), updated readWorldFile() and readObjectFile() to call it
            
            changed ENTITY_OBJ_ED to ENTITY_O_EDESC to match ENTITY_R_EDESC, also changed unequip.cpp
            error messages for less redundancy, also forgot to rewrite unequip, i think it still has some
            dupe code
            
            similarly removed error message redundancy in purge, mount, unmount, follow, and unfollow
            
            created deleteFile() function, replaced numerous unlink()/remove() calls
            
            wrote writeExtraDesc(), updated writeWorld/Object
            
            wrote code for reading/writing default extra desc
            
            wrote code for editing/deleting default extra desc
            
            fixed bug in readRoomExit() with NULL roomPtrs that should have crashed on reading default
            exits, but didn't until i changed the arg order, but eh, whatever, it's fixed
            
            changed createExtraDesc() to take copyDefault arg, since i don't always want to overwrite the
            desired keywords
            
            default extra descs are now fully implemented
            
            changed 'exits' command to pause every screenful
            
            rewrote quest reading code to read each quest in a separate function, it seems to work..  i will
            write the default quest code shortly - the quest writing code is already split up
            
5/17/2007 - changed room look and mob look code to pause, changed all new pausing code to actually abort when
            user hits Q
            
            wrote code for writing/reading/deleting/editing default quest/shop and copying the info into new 
            quests/shops
            
            added SHOWOBJCONTENTS var, setting it to false causes no obj/mob contents/eq to be shown in
            inv and 'look', like before - it defaults to true
            
            changed 'equip all' command to pause every screenful, ditto 'unequip'
            
5/18/2007 - fixed bug whereby you could have two shops in a room by creating shops for already loaded mobs 
            
            'copy default' command can now copy into default edesc, quest, and shop

5/19/2007 - can now take room edescs, created removeExtraDescFromList() to facilitate, changed inventory
            command to display room/obj edescs            
            
            added pausing and proper abortion to take all, drop all, and put all
            
            removed redundancies between unequipMob and unequipMobSpecific
            
            can now take obj edescs, i'm pretty sure it works
            
            edescs are now read from and written to the .inv file
            
            increased .inv file format to v2, allowed reading of v1 and v2 files
            
            changed inventory file reading code to just resize entity ptrs/types if max is hit and of course
            dynamically increase max, decreased default max from 32768 to 32
            
            removed last use of cout, reduced EXE size from 572k to 532k
            
            changed put command to say 'given to' when putting into mob
            
            changed all inventory commands to show 'copy of' when appropriate
            
            created addExtraDesctoList(), created code to drop edescs in current room
            
            created code to put edescs in objects
            
            uploaded to Jollython
            
            found bug whereby typing 'check' would always bring up 'checkconfig', similarly fixed checkmap,
            dunno why this never popped up before but it was because check was after checkconfig in the
            command table, go figure
            
            also fixed bug in checkPause() where it wouldn't reset the numbLines counter if the user quit
            
            uploaded fixed version to Jollython
            
            started file-by-file rework, so as to fix any lingering missed issues
            
            quitting out of the 'delete an exit' prompt would not display two linefeeds
            
            created buildCommonDisplayExitsStrn() since the same decent size chunk was being done in four
            different places
            
            checked files through crtroomu.cpp
            
            the issue with the above 'check' problem is that strcmpnocasecount() is basically strleft.
            i can't think of a legitimate reason to check exact matches first when i can just bump commands
            up in the list, so i removed the exact matching code from checkCommands()
            
            removing that made me realize that strlefticount had been wrong all this time.  DOH.  it's fixed
            now
            
            strleft and strlefti always assumed that strn was longer than substrn, but there's no magical
            reason why that has to be the case..  fixed possible overrun and reworked affected code
            
            updated displayFlagMenu() to use actual screen height instead of forced constant to determine
            number of columns displayed
            
            changed const version of displayColorString() to alloc non-const string if const string length
            is >= 16384
            
            rewrote createEditableList() to call createEditableNode()
            
            changed displayEditExitStateMenu() to call getExitStateMenuStrn() for redundancy, and now the
            options are always shown available if EDITUNEDITABLEFLAGS is set
            
            changed createKeywordString() and getReadableKeywordString() to take intMaxLen args and respect
            them mightily
            
            sadly there are still others, like getFlagStrn() and getClassStrn() and perhaps others
            
            generally improved string safety of editval.cpp funcs
            
            finished through editval.cpp
            
            added intMaxLen to getClassString() and getFlagStrn() functions, made them pay attention
            
            updated getMenuDataTypeStrn() to take intMaxLen as required by previous updates
            
            created g_exitnames_short, changed getDirfromKeyword() to use g_exitnames tables
            
            finished up through flags.cpp
            
            changed version of getStrn() that doesn't take oldStrn to create dynamic string if length is
            too long
            
            changed checkCurrentMasterKeywordList() in a manner identical to the way I changed
            checkEditableList() earlier
            
            getMatchingMob() was running through entire list instead of simply returning findMob(vnum)
            
            created functions for redundant chunks of checking die string validity
            
            changed copyMobHereList() to call copyMobHere() rather than reproducing the code.  it looks
            like it works to me
            
            ditto deleteMobHereList()
            
            started converting mudcomm.cpp getCommandStrn() from massive case statement to more efficient
            table, but i am sleepy and it will take a while and i will do it later
            
5/20/2007 - finished converting mudcomm.cpp

            fixed getMatchingObj() to not run through entire object list on vnum
            
            changed checkAllObjInsideForVnum() to return actual objHere that matched and findObjHere() to
            always return actual objHere that matched
            
            created totem.h, put sphere constants in there, changed getTotemSphereStrn() to use constants
            
            changed getObjValueStrn() to not take obj arg, since it didn't use it
            
            updated displayObjectInfo() to show all 8 values..  whoops
            
            finished up through objtypes.cpp
            
            optimized number of columns displayed in displayFlagMenu() to take up the entire screen
            
            fixed recent bug in 'tell' command whereby you would have had to enter capital Qs and Ds for it 
            to match
            
            also made quest code a bit less redundant via tellRedund()
            
            replaced various unsafe uses of strcpy() with strncpy() - getMenuListTypeStrn() could also use
            an intMaxLen but I just don't feel like it at this juncture
            
            removed copyMobInfo arg from copyRoomInfo() since it was never used
            
            removed deleteMobs arg from deleteRoomInfo() since it was never used
            
            changed var functions to all not interpret color codes when displaying var name/value
            
            created displayVarSettings() func for redundant display of var settings
            
            created getVar() func to return const variable * and removed redundant code in getVar..() funcs
            
            that's all the files
            
            changed getMenuListTypeStrn() to respect intMaxLen and getObjValueStrn() to truncate all verbosity
            to 63 chars, so i should be golden for all and/or most plausible overflow possibilities
            
5/24/2007 - changed all area-file-reading funcs to loop while (true) rather than while (!feof()) since feof
            is detected by readAreaFileLine
            
            improved removeComments() to use string pointer
            
            fixed bug in readObjectFromFile() whereby nextStrn wasn't reset even though it should have been
            
            removed readWorld/ObjExtraDescFromFile() since they were each one line
            
            replaced objectNode in readobj with objPtr
            
            changed displaySimpleMenuHeader() to adjust width for screen, only mattered for edesc and
            quest message
            
            fixed bug in displayColorString() whereby invalid color codes potentially prevented proper
            analysis of further color codes, also possible buffer overflow issue, not that it ever seemed
            to actually happen
            
5/25/2007 - fixed potential problem with fixAllFlags() using dupe variable names

            created solution and project for VS 2003, which didn't like the above
            
5/26/2007 - created preDisplayLongMenuHeader() and called from all menu display header funcs, for efficiency

            decided to switch back over to using VS 2003 and replaced de.exe in the archive, because it's
            80k smaller and functionally exactly the same
            
            added message to checkmaps command displayed when no invalid map exits found
            
            also fixed minor flaw whereby checkmap command treated exit->destRoom as unsigned instead of 
            signed
            
5/27/2007 - removed returning roomNumb in loadMob() since it was not used

            added line # display to a few more zone error messages
            
            improved readzon.cpp by delaying objhere/mob/etc creation until everything is kosher
            
            rewrote convertMobMoney() for efficiency
            
            readRoomExitFromFile() would not have allowed lowercase d in direction string
            
 6/8/2007 - oddly, system() and _execl() and the rest don't work if DE is compiled with VS 2003, so removed
            2003 project/solution and went back to 2005
            
 6/9/2007 - changed masterListNode to take const pointer to keywords rather than copying them, removed
            deletion, created createMasterNode() func, changed masterListNode to take const entityPtr since
            its contents are never altered
            
            similarly changed editableListNode to use const pointer to keywords
            
            look command could be improved, right now it uses the old-inventory-esque method of creating and
            deleting a 'dummy' master node if user looks by vnum
            
            rewrote look command to not use dummy master nodes and generally be more clear
            
            created displayIndividualObj for redundancy betwixt mob inventory and object contents
            
            improved indenting code to not use strcat()
            
            created getObjShortNameDisplayStrn(), adds vnum if vnum display is on or obj has no type, and
            adds random %age, called from displayIndividualObj() and displayMobEqPos(), also called from
            showInventory() with blnKeywords true
            
            moved displayMobEqPos(), displayMobEquip(), and displayMobMisc() to look.cpp since it makes more
            sense to me
            
            changed displayMobEquip() to use a table of positions and position names rather than a long list
            of direct function calls
            
            moved displayCurrentRoom() to look.cpp because i like it
            
7/31/2007 - slightly improved efficiency of getObjShortNameDisplayStrn()
