Should you wish to use some portion of the durisEdit code that would require one or more of the exempted 
files, I trust that you can reason out a way to reproduce that code's functionality without utilizing the 
exempted files as-is (insofar as the text contained within those files is protected by whatever laws exist 
within any applicable locales).
