elvish sword antiquity~
The sword is extremely large, yet possess an uncanny balance to it, like it
was enhanced magicly.  It seems to glow a slightly blue color.  The sword
is extremely old, possible dating back many milenia... speaking of an
ancient and lost origin.  Yet it is possible to tell that it was forged
by a master elven craftsmen, due to the intricate scroll work of elven runes
on the flat of the blade.

bottomless bag tinker~
This bag of Tinkers is profoundly the ugliest thing you have ever laid
eyes on.  In hues and colors which just were never meant to be put
together the bag was tactfully designed to assault your sense of
aesthetics.  However, after taking a peek into the bag, you are amazed
to see absolutely no bottom; no wonder the Tinkers can move their
entire lives around in such tiny wagons.  There is a nifty little
strap slung over your shoulder to wear on those long journies across
the land.

      I have been informed that you have been searching for as far back as
      the lineage of your people extends, looking for your Song.  My heart
      goes out to you in your endless quest; please take these boots offered
      to you as a most unworthy a gift for such an honorable people.

silver pool~
The pool sparkles in the sunlight, clear and clean.  Little fish can be
seen darting along the bottom of the pool.  Nuggets of silver are scattered
along the bottom of the pool and cause the entire pool to radiate reflected
light.  The pool is surrounded by a ring of white stones which creates
a damlike structure to the south where a small stream of water can be
seen pouring over the edge, cascading down the side of the hill.
