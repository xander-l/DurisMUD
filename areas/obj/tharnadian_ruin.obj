Rescued from Tharnadia's Temple of the Holy Warrior after it was
subverted to an evil purpose, this tablet is now yours.  Once held,
it feels as if someone is watching over you, and protecting you from
harm.  The tablet reads:

&+Y .   .. ________________________________________________________________ ..   .
&+Y
&+Y                               The Holy Code of Honor
&+Y
&+Y     It is so written that the honor of every knight holds thee to thy course
&+Y       in life, protects thee in times of peril, and guides thee to restore
&+Y      peace and goodness to the world.  The laws of knighthood bind thee to
&+Y     thine gods, and lead thee to thy ultimate glory of the afterlife.  Read
&+Y                 well these laws, and make them a part of thy life:
&+Y
&+Y          1) Thou shalt never kill another adventurer in cold blood.
&+Y          2) Thou shalt not steal from another adventurer, and shall always
&+Y               return those goods lost by others to their rightful owner.
&+Y          3) Thou shalt not flee from battle if there is even the slightest
&+Y                   chance for victory, for thy bravery is thy honor.
&+Y          4) Thou shalt help the weak and poor, or anyone whom has less than
&+Y                  thee, for the meek are the warriors of the future.
&+Y          5) Thou shalt perform no deed of malice or greed, savagery or hate,
&+Y              or any other act of evil that might tarnish thy code of honor.
&+Y
&+Y      It is by these simple laws that we bind our faith, and fight together
&+Y     for the cause of good and peace.  Those that stray from it, are forever
&+Y                     dammed from the holy light of the gods...
&+Y
&+Y                                 So speaks the code
&+Y .   .. ________________________________________________________________ ..   .
