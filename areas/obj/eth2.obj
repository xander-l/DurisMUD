mace godsfury~
Forged long ago by the ancient dwarven gods, this mace has a history that
has been told to generations of mountain dwarves, passed on from father to
son in an endless chain.  This mace was lost long ago by the dwarven king
Khal-alhak, ambushed in the mountain passes near Kimordril by hobgoblins
of the Bloodfang Clan.  A long war erupted between the dwarves and the
hobgolins, with untold atrocities being committed by both sides.
Centuries later, it was recovered by Khal-alhak's grandson when the
dwarves leveled the last fortress of the Bloodfang Clan.  Thirty years
ago, the mace and its guardian, the priest Tholgrom, disappeared without a
trace.

flower ethereal rose~
&+gThis&n &+rflower&n &+gis a delicate object of infinite beauty, a magical creation
&+gthat rivals and perhaps surpasses any&n &+rrose&n &+gof natural origins. Crafted
&+gfrom the &+cc&+Ch&+ca&+bo&+Cs&n &+gof the &+CDre&+cam Wo&+Crld&n &+gby an insane&n &+mdrow&n &+garchmage, the spell
&+grequired to fashion the&n &+rrose&n &+gkilled the crazed &+mdrow&+g. The powers of the
&+gobject are unknown, but when held by any person, a clear voice can be
&+gheard in their head, repeating the same message endlessly, a message from
&+gthe mage to a&n &+mdrow muse&+g:&n

&+mMy dearest muse,

&+mI've told you before what you mean to me.  You've become a dear, dear
&+mfriend to me in a short period of time.  I care for you a great deal, and
&+mhope you feel the same.  Life in Aracdrathos and the Underdark can be
&+mharsh, and it amazes me that a creature of your beauty could have been
&+mspawned in such an environment.  My life, dedicated to the magical arts,
&+mhas offered me little time for companionship.  You have intrigued and
&+mcharmed me, beguiling me with your warmth and spirit, amazing me with your
&+mstrength of character and range of talents.  You have enriched an old
&+mmage's life, and could give me no greater gift than your friendship.

&+mYou may call on me at any time and know that I will be there for you,
&+moffering any and all assistance I can.  Know that you are in my thoughts
&+mand heart always.

&+gNeither the name of the mage or the drow woman that fascinated him is ever
&+gstated, and they have been forgotten over time.  All that remains of the
&+gfeelings the mage had for the muse is this timeless flower, an oddly
&+gromantic gesture from a race known mostly for cruelty and hate.

helmet corruption~
This helm is made from a single piece of demon flesh, wrapped in bands of
solidified ethereal fog, and inscribed with the runes of time.  A power
beyond mortal comprehension went into making this armor, a testament to
the power of the ethereal lord.

mace godsfury~
Forged long ago by the ancient dwarven gods, this mace has a history that
has been told to generations of mountain dwarves, passed on from father to
son in an endless chain.  This mace was lost long ago by the dwarven king
Khal-alhak, ambushed in the mountain passes near Kimordril by hobgoblins
of the Bloodfang Clan.  A long war erupted between the dwarves and the
hobgolins, with untold atrocities being committed by both sides.
Centuries later, it was recovered by Khal-alhak's grandson when the
dwarves leveled the last fortress of the Bloodfang Clan.  Thirty years
ago, the mace and its guardian, the priest Tholgrom, disappeared without a
trace.

flower ethereal rose~
&+gThis&n &+rflower&n &+gis a delicate object of infinite beauty, a magical creation
&+gthat rivals and perhaps surpasses any&n &+rrose&n &+gof natural origins. Crafted
&+gfrom the &+cc&+Ch&+ca&+bo&+Cs&n &+gof the &+CDre&+cam Wo&+Crld&n &+gby an insane&n &+mdrow&n &+garchmage, the spell
&+grequired to fashion the&n &+rrose&n &+gkilled the crazed &+mdrow&+g. The powers of the
&+gobject are unknown, but when held by any person, a clear voice can be
&+gheard in their head, repeating the same message endlessly, a message from
&+gthe mage to a&n &+mdrow muse&+g:&n

&+mMy dearest muse,

&+mI've told you before what you mean to me.  You've become a dear, dear
&+mfriend to me in a short period of time.  I care for you a great deal, and
&+mhope you feel the same.  Life in Aracdrathos and the Underdark can be
&+mharsh, and it amazes me that a creature of your beauty could have been
&+mspawned in such an environment.  My life, dedicated to the magical arts,
&+mhas offered me little time for companionship.  You have intrigued and
&+mcharmed me, beguiling me with your warmth and spirit, amazing me with your
&+mstrength of character and range of talents.  You have enriched an old
&+mmage's life, and could give me no greater gift than your friendship.

&+mYou may call on me at any time and know that I will be there for you,
&+moffering any and all assistance I can.  Know that you are in my thoughts
&+mand heart always.

&+gNeither the name of the mage or the drow woman that fascinated him is ever
&+gstated, and they have been forgotten over time.  All that remains of the
&+gfeelings the mage had for the muse is this timeless flower, an oddly
&+gromantic gesture from a race known mostly for cruelty and hate.
