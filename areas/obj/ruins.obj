&+CMy dearest Son,
   &+CMy heart is breaking in grief from your death.  My hands tremble as
&+CI write this, every word a dagger to my soul, for I can never forget
&+Chow those beasts stole your life from you as though it meant nothing.
&+CTo them, I am sure, it meant just that, but to me, I have lost the will
&+Cto live.  I watch your bride, see her fading before my eyes, I mourn
&+Cfor her, knowing that she too can never forget.. Them.. The beasts..
&+Cthe vile creatures that destroyed all our lives on the day you were
&+Cto be married.  I pray to the Gods daily, begging them to take me to
&+Cjoin you and your Father, but thus far they ignore my pleas.  I beg you
&+Ccan forgive me, but I cannot live much longer being so alone.  Your
&+Cbride, the poor child, is near death from a broken heart and I cannot
&+Ceven find fault in her for that.  She is strong, but the shock has
&+Cdestroyed her.  Alas, I must go.  I pray that you can read this from
&+Cabove, that the Gods grant you this, to know that you are still loved.

&+CWith a grieving heart,
&+CYour Mother
