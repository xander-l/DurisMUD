book robert roberts diary~
&N   This simple black bound book seems to have been someone's diary at one
time. It tells the tale of young man, eager for knowledge, regardless of
the consequences, and his journey toward power. He speaks of the dark arts
of necromancy, and the raising of undead to do his bidding. It talks of how
he worked at a school, or college of some sort, rising through the ranks to
near graduation.
&N   However here it is almost as if the writer changes. The writer, Robert,
says that he was visiting the area around his school when he met a young
woman named Larra. He speaks of emotions and feelings the like of which
he has never had before. However appearently he was about to graduate,
and his master, a man named Zrack, was going to send him to Bloodstone, away
from his love. Finishing up his graduation experiment, something called his
'Soul Item,' he chances an escape to avoid the dark path itself and the loss
of his love. Here the diary ends.

&+rwrapped in leather, and the crossguard is made of dragon bone. The blade
&+rhowever is made of seething metal that is held together my some unknown
&+rmagical means. It emits a slow hissing sound.
&+r   Made as a weapon by Kossuth, Lord of the Elemental Plane of Fire, for the
&+rAnti-paladin Maltheas, it served him well during the Wars of Light and Shadow.
&+rIt was during this war that the old god Sargon walked the surface of the
&+rworld. Only after many years was he imprisoned in the small village of Dubneth.
&+rMaltheas survived the forces of darkness well, but was eventually hunted down,
&+ralong with his dark master, The Master of Nightmares, by Sir Dithyan and the
&+rElven Prince Amrothlin. Maltheas was killed in the battle by Sir Dithyan,
&+rwielding the Blade of the Paladins. At this time the blade was banished back
&+rto the Elemental Plane of Fire. No one knows what happened to the Master of
&+rNightmares.
&+r   When Maltheas was reanimated he summoned the blade back from the elemental
&+rplane again. By this time Kossuth was in his period of exile and Imix was
&+rthe master of the plane. He had the blade until whatever happened to bring
&+rit into your hands.

something else, something more then both. However one thing does catch your

&+r        My old student, how goes the school that you set up? I have sent one
&+r     of my messengers to you, feel free to use him as a messenger back to me.
&+r     How is your research into dracoliches going? I hunger for your text.
&+r     The crypt has been expanded recently, you should come back and visit.
&+r     Everyone once in awhile some adventurers come and visit. I occasionally
&+r     have to create a doppleganger to take my place, they go killing all the
&+r     guards. Damn that one called Thugan, he is always in the lead, destroying
&+r     my minions. You know how hard it is to get good help these days.
&+r        Did you destroy that student named Robert? I had a feeling he was
&+r     going to get out of control when he drew the line at the eighth circle
&+r     of animations.
&+r        By the way, please send me a copy of the procedure you used to raise
&+r     Malthease up, the mixture of golem and undead magics I find fascinating.

                                                   Nakral, The Crypt Keeper

&+Lis even more rare. Almost none of this powerful armor is known to exist any
&+Lmore.
&+L   This set belonged to one of the greatest of Ironstar kings. When
&+LCharringsdeath came he knew that even with the armor, he would die. So they
&+Ltook away the money and jewels and left the armor in the vault. He kept a
&+Lkey, and gave two keys to the vault to his children.
&+L   One of these children was Haldran. When he came and vanguished Char he
&+Ldied in the landslide of rock and stone. No one knew what happened to his key.
&+LThe last key is still rumored to be among the dwarves, and only they know for
&+Lsure who has it. The armor tells no tales. Many say that the armor itself has
