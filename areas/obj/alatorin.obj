the story of jedd burningbraids&n~
   &+yThis appears to be the &+Woriginal &N&+yhand-written copy of the
&+yautobiography of Jedd Burningbraids.  Burningbraids, a master &+Ychanneler
&N&+ylogged the earliest of his adventures across &N&+gFaerun &+yin this book.
&+yAlthough the leather cover of this &+mtome&N&+g has all but been beaten into
&+ya thin &+Lflap&N+y, the hand-written heavy &+Lblack ink &N&+yletters can still
&+ybe made out on the &+Wparchment&N&+y.
  &+yThe story of Jedd begins with the &+Ymountain dwarf&N&+y getting lost in
&+yhis own city of &+cMithril &+CHall&N&+y, the long-since &+Ldestroyed &N&+yhome
&+yof the early &+Ymountain dwarves&N.  &+yJedd is said to have picked up the
&+yfine '&+Ba&+rr&+Rt&n&+y' as he called it, as early as 47 years old, which is
&+yquite young for a &+Ymountain dwarf&N&+y of the &+RBu&N&+Yrn&+Ri&+Rngbraids &N&+ybloodline.
   &+yAfter Jedd marked &+BWaterdeep &n&+yas his new home, he soon found his way
&+ythrough the &+gAlterian Region &+yand, with his newfound friends, into a
&+yvillage of &+Lorcs&N.  &+LSplit Shield &N&+ywould discover &+YJedd's &+Wtrue power&N&+y.
   &+yAfter his slaughter of &+LSplit Shield&N&+y, the then-masterful &+Yconjurer
   &+ytook great seige to other locations including &N&+rBloodstone Keep&N&+y and &+WIce &+CCrag &+LCastle &N&+ybut never actually claimed the throne of either.
   &+YJedd's &N&+yearliest years are detailed further in his torried, but &+Rpassionate
   &+ylove affair with a &+cgrey elven &+Yson&N&+ygstr&N&+yess.  Her name was Lena and, ultimately, it was her &N&+rdeath&N&+y that drove &+YJedd &N&+ytoward his &+ysecond &+Wlife &N&+yof &+Wspirituality&n&+y.

tome lore~
   &+LThis tome, quite large for a duergar, bares the logged memoirs of
&+Lthe notorious clansdwarf guild &n&+bClan Stealth Hunter&+L.
&+LExcerpts from this ancient script contain the alliance between the dark
&+Liron dwarves and &N&+bClan Stealth Hunter&+L as well as the alliance
&+Lwith the &N&+cAlatorin &+Lrogus' guild.  Many accounts of &N&+rGeneral
&+rBakarakh &+Lare logged, cataloguing his many assassination expeditions
&+Land brutal &+Rmurders&+L.  Although just a simple tome, this book could
&+Lbe much more valuable to the &N&+bClan Stealth Hunter &N&+rduergars.
