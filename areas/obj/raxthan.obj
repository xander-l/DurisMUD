spellbook grimoire~
&+L   This mystical &+gs&+Ge&+gr&+Gp&+ge&+Gn&+gt &+Lruned &+bgrimoire &+Lhas been bound by the finest quality&N
&+Lmaterial.  The &+wwriting &+Lupon the book is a cruel crimson color, most likely the&N
&+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd &+Lfrom some sort of creature.  Forces of fate have forged this daemonical&N
&+Ltome.  Glowing &+mrunes &+Lradiate magical energy that crackles within the air.&N
~
E
runes~
&+L   The &+mrunes &+Lon this item number nine, they consist of a symbol of a demonical&N
&+Lcreature, a &+gs&+Ge&+grp&+Ge&+gnt&+Gi&+gn&+Ge &+Lmonster, the symbol of &+wchaos&+L, the insignia of &+mDarkuul&+L,&N
&+La picture of a shadow dragon, a symbol of &+RBozk&+L, a dancing crimson &+Rf&+rl&+Ra&+rm&+Re&+L, the&N
&+Lsymbol of the scapegoat and a glowing &+Gs&+gi&+Gg&+gi&+Gl&+L.  The &+mrunes &+Lradiate a magical haze&N
&+Lthat distorts reality.  This tome holds secrets that can never be known to&N
&+Lmortal fools who dwell in the shadows of the light.  Those of the &+wunlight &+Lhave&N
&+Lcrafted this mystical &+bgrimoire &+Lfrom the fabric of lost &+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+Cs&+L.&N
~
E
serpentine~
&+L   As you gaze at the &+gs&+Ge&+grp&+Ge&+gnt&+Gi&+gn&+Ge &+Lcreature you notice the word '&+RLeviathan&+L' has&N
&+Lbeen etched into its tail.  Perhaps this is here for a reason, or perhaps it&N
&+Lsimply is another relic from the past.  Sounds of battle start to fade into&N
&+Lyour mind, the cries for mercy do not matter.  You start to see women slayed&N
&+Lalongside their children.  A dark figure is upon a hill and stares at you with&N
&+Lhis &+Rglowing &+Ldread red eyes.  The being does not seem to have a face yet it is&N
&+Lthere filling your soul with despair.  The &+wDea&+Lth &+wD&+Lealer sits on top of a black&N
&+Lsteed, perhaps a n&+bightma&+Lre.  For you know that this is worse than any, because&N
&+Lyou know it to be real.  Birds of pray circle the darkened evil &+wsky &+Lwaiting to&N
&+Lfeast upon your mortal flesh.&N
~
E
chaos~
&+L   This symbol has an eye placed within the center of it and has pointed arrows&N
&+Lwhich go in all directions outward.  &+wAs you gaze into the eye you &+Lstart to &+wsee&N
&+La world where &+wthe chaos gods rule.  People are mutated into creatures &+Lbeyond&N
&+Limagination.  &+wThe lands are in twisted ruins and humanity &+Lseems to be only &+wa&N
&+wlost myth in this realm of chaos.  &+LSlaves to darkness with nothing left of&N
&+Lwhat made them who, or what they once were.  You start to wonder if this is&N
&+Lsome kind of warning from the past, or even the future.&N
~
E
insignia darkuul~
&+L   This dark magenta colored &+minsignia &+Ldoes not seem to be one that is of the&N
&+Lfeeble light.  Most likely it spawns from that which is known as the &+wunlight&+L,&N
&+Lthe true might.  Only those with the sight can ever see, never to be right,&N
&+Lliving just to fight.  Serve the &+revil &+Ltill the day of no longer, worship the&N
&+Lmaster or die.  &+mDarkuul &+Lis the dark lord who shall deliver us from the hordes&N
&+Lof &+Chumans&+L.  The &+Ydwarves &+Lshall be tossed as they always have been, as in the now&N
&+Land what becomes the past.  Words of wisdom no longer hold meaning in the realm&N
&+Lof mortals.  Those that seem to be &+WImmortal &+Lmust kill all who dare to stand in&N
&+Ltheir way.  Mercy is for the meek who shall be given nothing and all shall be&N
&+Ltaken from them.  Power creates the rules, hiding in the shadows the goodies&N
&+Llurk in their pathetic groups.  Men of twenty yet not even to have one, all for&N
&+Lthemselves and nothing for the all.  Reality starts to fade into your eyes and&N
&+Lyou gaze at what seems to be the symbol of a d&+barkne&+Lss.&N
~
E
shadow~
&+L   Scales of darkness upon a beast of dismal despair.  The eyes of fire burn in&N
&+Lsockets of &+rp&+Ra&+rg&+Ra&+rn &+Rf&+ri&+Rr&+re&+L.  Beastial images of death fade into your mind and shiver&N
&+Ldown along your spine.  Nothing no longer seems to be even close to fine.  A&N
&+Lsign is sort in the sky of the realms of the dark one.  Monsters morph into&N
&+Lyour brain from the nine hells of the infernal plane.  Dreams of the lost are&N
&+Lforever to be no longer.  Screams of torment ring out within your head, yes&N
&+Lfilling you with dread.  The wings of this beast span at least eighteen feet&N
&+Lacross and have stains of dried crimson on them.  The claws of terror also have&N
&+Ltasted the blood of the eager to die meager.  This symbol has been drawn by&N
&+wThose of The Unlight&+L.&N
~

bozk~
&+R   Eyes &+Lof demonical fire burn within a &+cs&+Co&+cu&+Cl &+Lscourned image of dismal death.&N
&+LThe cries of the lost fill your mortal mind as you gaze at this symbol of the&N

&+Ldefy the d&+barkne&+Lss burn in the &+Ct&+cw&+Ci&+cl&+Ci&+cg&+Ch&+ct &+Lof &+wunlight&+L.  Suffering of the fallen&N
&+Lfools who thought they could survive the fires of the black abyss.  Screams of&N
&+Ltorment, torture of the meek, death to any who seek.  Focus wishes it was no&N
&+Llonger as reality fades into a &+bnight&+Lmare.  Heads upon stakes, &+Rbl&+ro&+Ro&+rd &+Lupon thine&N
&+Lground, eyes rolled by fatal fate.  Hate of the light, &+Bthunder &+Lcrackles within&N
&+Lthe demonic air.  &+CSh&+Wi&+Cv&+We&+Crs &+Lslowly stream down your &+Wspine&+L, nothing at all seems&N
&+Lto be even near fine.  Time drifts into limbo, what is real no longer can be&N
&+Lrealized for sure.  Images from the past becomes the present, resent, descent,&N
&+Lall flowing into &+Rpain&+L.  &+CRain &+Lof &+Ws&+Ce&+Wrp&+Ce&+Wnt&+Ci&+Wn&+Ce &+Lwinter falls from out the &+wclouded&N
&+Lsky of the raven realms.  Flickering, fading, changing, pupils dilate, things&N
&+Lalmost drift back into sane.  Insane voices echo inside your hollow head, yet&N
&+Lyou can not make out what they are saying.  &+wWhispers &+Lfrom beyond eternal &+bnight&N
&+Lfill the body with untold fright.  Might makes right, no matter the height, to&N
&+Ldestroy those who dare to ever care.  Cast them not but a &+Bcold &+Llifeless stare,&N

scapegoat~

&+wflows downward.  Your soul starts to feel the scourn of those that are not of&N
&+wthe light.  A burning feeling that truly is colder then even the mighty nordic&N
&+wwinter.  Images of the realms of despair start to fill your mortal eyes causing&N
&+wthem to be in need of repair.  An unholy glare starts to stare into your mind&N
&+wand you realize not everything is fine.  The calls of the damned start to fill&N

&+LThe cries of the lost fill your mortal mind as you gaze at this symbol of the&N

&+Ldefy the d&+barkne&+Lss burn in the &+Ct&+cw&+Ci&+cl&+Ci&+cg&+Ch&+ct &+Lof &+wunlight&+L.  Suffering of the fallen&N
&+Lfools who thought they could survive the fires of the black abyss.  Screams of&N
&+Ltorment, torture of the meek, death to any who seek.  Focus wishes it was no&N
&+Llonger as reality fades into a &+bnight&+Lmare.  Heads upon stakes, &+Rbl&+ro&+Ro&+rd &+Lupon thine&N
&+Lground, eyes rolled by fatal fate.  Hate of the light, &+Bthunder &+Lcrackles within&N
&+Lthe demonic air.  &+CSh&+Wi&+Cv&+We&+Crs &+Lslowly stream down your &+Wspine&+L, nothing at all seems&N
&+Lto be even near fine.  Time drifts into limbo, what is real no longer can be&N
&+Lrealized for sure.  Images from the past becomes the present, resent, descent,&N
&+Lall flowing into &+Rpain&+L.  &+CRain &+Lof &+Ws&+Ce&+Wrp&+Ce&+Wnt&+Ci&+Wn&+Ce &+Lwinter falls from out the &+wclouded&N
&+Lsky of the raven realms.  Flickering, fading, changing, pupils dilate, things&N
&+Lalmost drift back into sane.  Insane voices echo inside your hollow head, yet&N
&+Lyou can not make out what they are saying.  &+wWhispers &+Lfrom beyond eternal &+bnight&N
&+Lfill the body with untold fright.  Might makes right, no matter the height, to&N
&+Ldestroy those who dare to ever care.  Cast them not but a &+Bcold &+Llifeless stare,&N
&+Lmurder them in cold &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd&+L.  You realize to dream that is your death once more.&N
