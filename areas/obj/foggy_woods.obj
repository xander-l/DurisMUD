runes book~
A thick book, bound in a strange animal hide you are not familiar with,
which deals with the archaic runes of the Northlands. Several chapters
deal with the intricacies of a unique magical system based upon the
use of various runes as protection, warning, and preservation spells.
Additionally, there is a more mundane section of the book which
translates some Northland runes used as languages into the common
tongue.
