The idol rises up from a snakes body to flow into the torso of a snarling
human with four arms.  Each of the arms ends in a large bowl that is
clearly used for donations, donations of a macabre sort.  Broken, bloody
bodies of small animals, and the skulls of large animals lie within the
bowls, adding their decaying stench to the humid air.

the collar to keep the scales from wearing away or dulling with age.

   Careful inspection reveals that this strange robe has been made
entirely from the skins of unfortunate elves.  As such, it is a vile and
despicable piece of work, though likely to be worth a great deal to drow
and other haters of elves.

the metal pan is white hot while the outside surface looks cool enough to

sign skull skulls~
Individual words have been carved into each separate skull, and the skulls
have been lined up to form a macabre sign that proclaims:
                &+WDeath to any that refuse to honor&N
                           &+rSkrentherlog&N
                        &+WGod of Everything&N

It seems that the reader is expected to know who Skrentherlog is.
