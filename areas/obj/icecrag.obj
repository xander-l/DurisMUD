several layers, and the top is woven with the skin from the fingers.  The
intertwined fingers make it look like a hand is clamping over the shoe.

skin is covered in old blisters and sores, and shockingly, they still
fester.  The skin is plyable and slightly warm. Almost as if the tissue

   Its made from the skull of a Calimshan sand worm.  The relative
flatness of the front area of the skull lends it self well to resting on
a humanoid face.  After polishing and removal of the flesh, its quite
comfortable and very protective.  Its main purpose is to shelter the
wearer from the horrible sandstorms that brew down south.

sandstorms of the Calimshan desert are no place to be caught without a

leaking any sand.  The lenses appear to be glass, but dont scratch or
chip even when pressure is applied.  The strap looks a little worn.

   The horses front leg has a visible compound fracture above the right hoof.
It is easy to understand how this could have happened on the trail around the
ice flow, considering all th rocks.  The blow to the neck appears to have two
ends, it doesn't go all the way across the neck like a sword slash.  It is
also much deeper than a sword would ever go, it looks much like an axe wound.
The corpse has not decayed yet so it can only be a day or so old, but in
these frigid temperatures there can be no telling for sure.

wakizashi sword~
   Unlike most swords, the metal of the blade does not extend to the end
of the pommel.  Halfway down the shaft of the handle, the blade stops and
is held in place by a plug that passes thru the blade and the two halves
of the grip.  The plug is in turn held in place by the black cloth wrap
that twists around the handle, providing not only structural support, but
a comfortable grip as well.  The metal of the blade is honed to a razor
edge, with the waves of the temper fully visible as a result of the clay
quenching process.  It is a most fearsome weapon in close quarters.

&+LMahdrel,

   Myrke has discovered an effort to reclaim the shroud.  It must be
foiled at all costs.  The craftsmen rebuilding the upper hallways have
redesigned the rooms surrounding the vault. Your key will be the first in
a group of several that will be required to access the shroud.  For
maximum security I have spread them out among trusted men.  You are to
slay on sight any that enters your post without me at their side,
including any of our own that wander in...trust no one.  The shroud is
vital to our efforts, I trust you will not fail me.

leather, the purpose being to provide support, strength, and protection
from the cutting edge of a sword should it ever come in contact with one.
The opening is protected by a key lock, sewn into the cover flap.

1. Thank mom, dad, strife, the clergy, and Auril.
2. Talk about how rough it was getting this far, make up some stuff about
struggling along and such.
3. Get choked up, then talk about plans to take over the...scratch that,
to advance in the hierarchy of the clergy or something less aggressive.

The notes go on all the way to the bottom of the page, where there is a
little arrow that says "---->Next Page"

commander.
12. Tell the story about Masha and the Calimshan woman, get very graphic.

surpassed and make them feel small.
14. Close with "Thank you and good night!"

sleeves troll hide~
   The sleeves appear to be made of tanned troll hide, evident by the
heavy pock marking and cystic scars.  The tanning process was very
complete, leaving no trace of moisture in the skin.  Long, flat rib bones
are used as framework for the sleeves, giving them rigidity and strength.

   The mask is hand carved from the blackest ebony. It sits comfortably
on ones face, by virtue of a soft leather thong that rests around the
head, above the ears.  The eyes are cut out wide, and hollow, and the
mouth is exaggerated, as if screaming in absolute horror.

   The flask appears to be steel plated with silver on the inside to
maintain the integrity of whatever is placed with in it.  The surface is
covered in scrimshaw artistry, the likes of which have not been seen in
decades.  It must be very old, but the threads on the cap, the shine, and
the seams indicate excellent craftsmenship.

   The pack is made from top grade buckskin tanned by a professional and
worked with expert hands.  The seams are woven shut with gut sinew and
thread twined from the thin hairs of a caribou. There is a large flap
that folds over and is drawn taught by a noose around the opening. Inside
there is a separate area to store a smaller bag of some sort.

key pouch buckskin~
   The key pouch is really a combination of pouch and ring.  The main
structure of the piece is an iron loop with a seperation in it that can
be spread apart to slide on new keys. Stretched around the loop is a
leather pouch that swallows all the keys when not in use.  It could fit
nicely into a pocket or a robe for easy access.

   The chest is made from solid iron plates, forge welded together at the

looks nearly impervious to any sort of blunt force, so the key would be

   Plucked straight from the carcass of a giant sandworm, the teeth are

sharp, and have a hollow center cavity which makes them ideal for those
who employ poisoned weapons.
