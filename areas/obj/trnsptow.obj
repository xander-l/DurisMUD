Glowing with a strange inner light this book has a magical aura that fills the
room with power.  The pedestal it rests on is plain and unadorned except for
the title that has been carved in a piece of wood that rests over the book.
The title of the book is simply, &+Y"Light and Illusion"&N and the strange runes
that are inscribed in the page beckon one to read it.  The more one stands
near it the greater the desire to read the book becomes, something about the
book suggests that it is the key to escaping this strange place.

helm~
A purity comes from within this helm, not the purity of goodness, or even
evil, but the purity of light.  Dazzling in its brilliance, a helm such as
this helps keep one's enemies off-guard and confused.  Though decorative,
this helm was clearly made to withstand the rigors of battle and time, its
smooth surfaces have yet to be marred or dented by either.

pliable only due to the magic they have been imbued with.  Any magic powerful
enough to make stone this pliable and strong is a magic to be respected.

A strong black hardwood of some sort has been used for the legs and back of
the sofa, and probably all the support interior to the cushions as well.  The
carefully carved flowers that run along the frame of the sofa add a quiet

purple fabric used to upholster the rest of the sofa helps highlight the
carvings and helps make the sofa look a bit longer than it actually is.

It is hard to determine exactly what type of stone this is, but its beauty is
undeniable.  An even yellow tint spreads throughout the stone, a tint that adds
rather than detracts from its beauty.  Perfectly even facets have been cut
around the entire surface of the gem to create a startling effect, the gem
looks exactly the same when viewed from any angle.

forlorn and depressed.

can be slain by its life-draining power.
