golden yuan ti relic~
   &+YThis golden relic is of a powerful two-headed yuan-ti wizard, most
&+Ylikely a powerful shadowmage diety like Juggashk the avatar of venom,
&+Yan 'inspiration' for Strahd over the years.  The yuan-ti and ophidians
&+Yhave become a certain fascination for the vampire count.  It is under-
&+Ystandable, furthermore, as the relationship between the yuan-ti and the
&+Yophidians is quite similar to Strahd and his Vistani's relationship with
&+Ythe people of Barovia and those that enter its forests.
   &+YThis miniature statue sits here, sealed to the floor, almost as if it
&+Ywas part of the darkstone itself.  It doesn't appear to be going anywhere
&+Yas it is controlled by a powerful magic, but does appear to be quite shiny,
&+Ymuch like the ophidian statue.  Someone has definitely given this statue
&+Ya good rubbing.

golden ophidian relic~
   &+YThis flawlessly crafted of a large, hunched over, bipedal ophidian
&+Yis perfect.  The ophidian is a race known notoriously as an enslaved
&+Yrace, bred and controlled by the yuan-ti.  The relationship between
&+Ythese two races, the yuan-ti and the enslaved ophidians is similar to
&+Ythe relationship between Strahd and the Barovians, only most of the
&+YBarovians don't realize it.
   &+YThis golden relic sits upright upon the ground, unable to move from
&+Yits connection to the treasury's floor.  Sealed down on the ground, it
&+Ydoes appear very shiny, perhaps after its been given a good rubbing.
&+YEither way, this thing won't budge.

&+Wfamous for being virtually impossible to wield, pronounce, or even be around
&+Wwithout encountering some form of injury.  For centuries, it was at the forefront
&+Wof all famous military loses in the realm.  It wasn't until the &+CElemenstor General
&+Wdevised a cunning plan to give the &+YShokurung'otaghe'rakag'onk'rakag &+Wto the
&+Wopposing army that it was actually used effectively.

&+WThe &+YShokurung'otaghe'rakag'onk'rakag &+Wis held in great esteem by the &+rZarovich
&+Wfamily.  Legend has it that if any man could wield the mighty axe he would become
&+Wa god.  No man has succeeded at the task until &+rStrahd Von Zarovich&+W grasped
&+Wthe blade, tossing it right back into the hands of the &+RHierarch &+rKuluk'shoko-
&+rurung'tagag'onk&+W and then &+rripping&+W out his &+Rheart &+Wbefore his own son,
&+RPrucha'shokourung'tagag'onk&+W, the last known wielder of the &+Caxe&+W.
