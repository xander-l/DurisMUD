long metal table~
The table is perhaps six feet long and three feet wide. Leather belts
are spaced evenly, totalling four in all. The belts are used to strap
down the patient while the priestess attempts to cure them of their
disease, be it imagined or real. The surface is warbled, allowing for
the blood to run in neat little riverlettes to the floor below.

A massive onyx slab has been transformed into an altar, its surface studded

arranged to form a mosaic. The picture is that of a woman's arm intertwined
with the writhing body of a serpent. Her blood-red nails are formed with
garnets and rubies, her arm with citrine and moonstone. The serpent seems
alive with the delicate arrangement of emeralds, sapphires, lapis lazuli,
and bloodstone.

A massive onyx slab has been transformed into an altar, its surface studded

arranged to form a mosaic. The picture is that of a woman's arm intertwined
with the writhing body of a serpent. Her blood-red nails are formed with
garnets and rubies, her arm with citrine and moonstone. The serpent seems
alive with the delicate arrangement of emeralds, sapphires, lapis lazuli,
and bloodstone.

their needlework, a warmer material will be granted to them. Quite a good
