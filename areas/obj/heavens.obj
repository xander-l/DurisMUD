                  &+WBASIC GUIDELINES FOR QUEST IMMORTALS ON DURIS&N

&+Y1)&n The quest immortals may not participate in any way with quests that they
   are running.   Either you run a quest, or participate; not both.

&+Y2)&n The quest immortals should wait at least one (1) hour after logging off
   their immortal before logging on any mortal character.  This obviously
   also implies that the quest immortals won't have any mortal characters
   logged on at the same time as their immortal.

&+Y3)&n While good race only and evil race only quests are okay, they should be
   evenly distributed.  For example, don't run 5 goodie quests and only 1
   evil only quest.

&+Y4)&n While answering petitions (responsibly) is fine, the quest immortals should
   not resurrect them, retrieve their corpses, etc.  The one exception to this
   is that they can resurrect or move corpses as part of their own quests.

&+Y5)&n Resurrections and corpse retrieving as mentioned above should be kept to
   a minimum.

&+Y6)&n Unique artifacts, Iouns, Full Artifacts, and level potions should never be
   given as quest rewards without explicit approval of a Forger or Overlord.

&+Y7)&n Items created as quest rewards should never be better then artifacts.

&+Y8)&n Items loaded or created as quest rewards should, for the most part, be
   similar to items in zones of similar difficulty as the quest (though
   strung to appear unique.)

&+Y9)&n If a quest immortal wants to create an item that doesn't exist in the game
   (which would therefore require special bits to be set), they need to talk
   to a Forger or Overlord first.

&+Y10)&n Quest immortals who have been granted the setbit command will NEVER use
    the command to set players under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

&+Y11)&n Items created for quest rewards must be earned, and never given freely.
    This includes, but is not limited to, transferring created equipment
    to your own mortal characters (either directly, or indirectly.)

&+Y12)&n These rules are completely subject to the interpretation and whims of the
    Forgers and Overlords.  In addition, the Forgers and Overlords may create
    additional rules and guidelines as they desire.

mighty hammer kelrarin~
The hammer is a remarkably ordinary looking weapon.  It is essentially a
large round-headed hammer that looks much like a common carpenters
mallet.  Its only noteworthy feature is that it is made entirely from
coal-black iron.  Even the handle is iron, patterned after wood grain
so that it resembles a common item.  It is very heavy.  Only a small
magical rune at the end of the hammer gives it away as a magical artifact.
Beneath it is carved a single name, 'Kelrarin'.

book council~
&+WThis book details the rules and responsibilities of those elected to
&+Wrepresent the Duris playerbase on the Player Council.

&+WMeetings will be Once a week for the Council members to discuss issues,
&+Wand Once a month with the council gods to present those issues.


&+WLook page1, page2, page3, page4, page5, page6
&+Wto find out what's inside.
~
E
page1~
&+W  1.  At all times, the player rep must remember that they are there to
&+Wrepresent all players, not just themselves, their guild or their clique.
&+WThis means that You must be impartial in listening to complaints and
&+Wsuggestions, and as well, do your best to filter out the realistic ideas
&+Wand complaints from the idiotic ones.  It is suggested you take notes
&+Wbetween meetings, try to stay brief and to the point, and try to avoid
&+Wany sort of partisanship when discussing these proposed changes, but
&+Winstead, try to think of what is best for the mud as a whole.
~
E
page2~
&+W  2.  During meetings, representatives will be restricted to discussing
&+WONLY issues of the mud.  Please refrain from bitching about each other,
&+Wthe other side of the race war, or any other personal issues.  Stick to
&+Wissues which affect the MUD balance, MUD fun, etc.
~
E
page3~
&+W  3.  The term of a rep will be for three r/l months.  At the end of the
&+Wthree months, we will hold new elections, and currently there are no
&+Wterm limits.
~
E
page4~
&+W  4.  Any representative who fails to make 2 meetings in a row will be
&+Wreplaced by the person who came in 4th place after them.  Any represen-
&+Wtative who misses 4 meetings (in a row or not) will also be replaced by
&+Wthe next in line.
~
E
page5~
&+W  5.  Cython and Tripod will retain full VETO power, yet will rely as well
&+Won the reps to maintain integrity and they will only use this power for
&+Wany truly stupid issues.
~
E
page6~
&+W   6.  The council gods (Jera, Dakta and Clavados) will be responsible for
&+Wmaintaining order for the regular meetings, and as well for passing on the
&+Wfinal decisions of the Council to the Immortals after the Monthly meeting.
&+WIn case of any ties in decision-making, they will be responsible for any
&+Wtie-breaking decisions.
~
E
page7~
&+W   7.  Using your avatar to scout the opposite side of racewars of your primary character, or
&+Wusing it to pass information to the other side of racewars will result in termination of your
&+Wavatar and possibly your primary character.

man statue~
&+B   Here is a preserved yet living version of a man, kept for some personal
&+Breason of Vareena's. He is tall, dark haired and built with welcoming arms.
&+BHe has a warm, contageous smile and holds his gaze in any direction that
&+Bone may move. Overwhelmingly beautiful, white wings are spread out from
&+Bbehind him. Each perfectly grown, downy feather is surrounded by its own
&+Bsoft glow. As there are hundreds of these, he stands as bright as a star.
&+BThere is something magical about this man. He seems to communicate a deep
&+Bknowing and healing love from within, without making a sound. There is a
&+Btiny &+bband&+B on the man's finger that hums and glows a faint blue aura.&N

&+LThe armor succeeded in its task, along with its sister items, a helm,
&+Land a mighty warhammer. However, as all great things progress, it was not meant
&+Lto be forever, so one fateful day, while laying waste to the &+MMindflayers&+L
&+Linside the caverns of &+rKhildarak&+L, they combined their mental energies,
&+Ltrapping &+wStrongstone&+L in the cavern, left to die to the ravages of age and
&+Ldisease. This armor glows with a fearsome light, and seems to have a strange power
&+Lto conform to the size of any body, from the tiniest goblin to the largest ogre.
&+LThis is truly a powerful set of platemail, and it makes its wearer a fearsome
&+Lopponent indeed in the throes of combat.

&+CThe ring is not of this world. The material used in its creation cannot be
&+cdetermined by any mortal. All history of this device has been lost in lore.
&+LThe circular band glows and pulses at irregular times and moments. A large and
&+Cmystical stone adorns the ring's upper circular position. The stone is likely
&+cnot of this world. Upon closer inspection of the stone, you see a strange
&+Lline of cypher that slowly morphs into the word, "Journey." It is apparent
&+Cthat this device of power was created for a very specific purpose. The ring
&+cis extremely light given the size of the stone.

&+BGENERAL INFORMATION&N
&+B-------------------&N
Barbarians are a primative human subrace, typically living sheltered,
supersticious lives within small clan or village settings. Most
barbarians tend to be extremely wary of outsiders, to the point of
parinoia and hostility, especially when witnessing displays of foreign
magic or religion. Many barbarian tribes have deeply ingrained
traditions of taboo, kindred with animal spirits, religious ceremonies,
and strong tribal unity, all of which can inhibit their ability to
travel with people who have different beliefs.
~

&+BRACIAL APPEARANCE&N
&+B-----------------&N
The following information is provided primarily for purposes of setting
character descriptions or for those interested in roleplaying.

As a human sub-race, barbarians reach maturity in their teenage years,
and can live to be around 100 years old. Their body builds tend to be
highly variable, with the common arctic peoples having bulky forms with
dark, windblown complexions and abnormal amount of hair. Eye color is
highly variable, with blue, brown and green being common. Hair is often
worn long, with black, brown, blonde and red being typical colors. When
compared to more 'civilized' humans, barbarians are often taller, with
males averaging around 7'0" and females 6'5". Similarly, their weights
are larger with 220lbs. being average for males and 180lbs. average for
females.

&+mGENERAL INFORMATION&N
&+m-------------------&N
Drow elves, also known as dark or night elves, are the most evil and
sinister of all the elven subraces. They are the antithesis of the good and
tranquil surface world elves, worshipping demonesses and evil elemental
gods in their underground cities. From this worship, drow tend to be
extremely devious and chaotic, making them even more feared by other races.
Millennia ago in a great war which split the elven races, the drow were
driven into the blackness of the Underdark, where they have developed their
own cruel society..building it on a hatred of their distant elven cousins.

Currently, the drow elves of Duris are found deep in the Underdark within
their stronghold city of Arachdrathos.

Similar to the other elven subraces, drow elves are a long lived race. Those
lucky enough to survive the chaos of the Underdark can live to be over 475
years old and are considered mature adults around the age of eighty. Drow
have a lithe, slim and graceful body build, with elongated features and
pointed ears. Their skin is usually jet black, an occasional albino being the
exception, and they normally sport white, silver or copper colored hair and
eyes of red, black, green or brown. Unlike most races, drow females are of
sturdier build, averaging 5'2" tall and 110 lbs, while males tend to be a
couple of inches shorter and 10-15 lbs lighter.

&+LGENERAL INFORMATION&N
&+L-------------------&N
Duergar dwarves, also know as grey dwarves, are a malevolent breed of dwarf
that lives deep underground, often in cities far removed from other dwarves.
Since duergar are often bested in struggles with other dwarves, particularly
deep dwarves with whom they directly compete for space and mining materials,
they often live in poor strongholds and desolate areas. Occasionally, a
duergar clan will find wealth in these obscure locales and thrive in their
production of stone and metal crafts in a manner similar to other dwarves.
However, duergar workmanship tends to be inferior to that of other dwarven
races, perhaps a handicap of their evil, deceitful nature.

Currently, duergar dwarves can be found deep in the Underdark in their
stronghold, Khildarak.

Duergar dwarves have a life expectancy of about 400 years and are considered
mature adults around forty years old. Duergar appear very emanciated, with
pasty-white skin, sunken eyes of a deep black or gray color and are often
bald or shaven. Duergar also keep beards, but don't tend to care for them
as much as surface dwarves. Males and females are of similar builds, with
average heights around 3'10" and weights around 100-120 lbs.

Gnomes are smaller cousins of the dwarfs who tend to be friendly and
heavily inclined towards magic. They generally live in hilly, wooded
regions which can offer underground homes, places where they may remain
unseen in order to pursue their joys of mining and craft undisturbed.
Gnomish society is very well organized and patterned after a clannish
system. Although gnomes are cousins of dwarves, they celebrate their hard
work with many more festivals and holidays, priding themselves on hard
work and joyous play. Gnomish people are also very inclined towards music
and the crafting of musical instruments, as well as woodcarving and
brewing.

Gnomes are a long lived race which can live to be 400 to 600 years old,
not even reaching adulthood until nearly 60 years of age. They are a small
race as well, with average height being just over three feet and the
average weight being around 80 pounds. Gnomish beings have dark tan or
woody brown colored skin which is reminescient of carved wood, and of
course their most striking feature is their uncommonly large noses, fully
twice the size of the average human or dwarf. Gnomes are highly
intelligent, hence their sucess with magic, however their joyous nature
makes them less wise in the ways of the world. They sport excellent manual
dexterity which assists them in their well respected wood carving and gem
cutting endevours.

&+GGENERAL INFORMATION&N
&+G-------------------&N
Half-elves are not, techincally speaking, a race but rather the offspring
of the union of an elf and human (half-elvesmating with half-elves will
produce half-elves though). Half-elves tend to have traits from both parents
and often face racism and severe psycological problems in either society.
Many half-elves travel back and forth between elven and human societies,
enjoying life as it comes to them.
~
E
page2 2~
&+GRACIAL APPEARANCE&N
&+G-----------------&N
Half-elves can live to be approximately 155 years old, reaching maturity in
the mid to late teenage years. This causes them some difficulty, as they are
longer lived that humans and shorter lived than elves, adding to their
feelings as an outcast race. Half-elves are generally slightly larger than
elves, due to their human heritage, but retain many of the elongated features
of their elven parents. However, most half-elves do not have pointed ears.
Their eyes and hair are highly variable in color, as per humans, with brown,
black, and red being common. Males average around 5'6" and 128 lbs, while
females tend to be slightly smaller at an average of 5'4" and 103 lbs.

&+Y-------------------&N
Halflings are a race of diminuative humanoids, which appear much as human
children do and live in a manner akin to that of humans. Although not
particularly industrious, halflings have an ingenuity that makes their lack-
luster efforts yield excellent results. Theit typical crafts tend towards the
ordinairy and the mundane, such as farming, banking, innskeeping, and the
merchant trade. halflings also take great pleasure in nature and prefer to live
in pastorial countrysides, with a mixture of cottages and underground burrows
for dwellings. Their most well known feature is a tendency towards mischecious
and good-natured playfulness.

&+YRACIAL APPEARANCE&N
&+Y-----------------&N
In general, halflings may be considered mature adults around the age of 20 and
may live to be over 150 years old in some rare cases. They tend to have a
rotund appearance, with ruddy complexions, making them appear much like human
children. Eye color is typically blue or hazel, and hair color is almost always
some shade of brown, from sandy to dark brown. Males and females are of
comparable heights and weights, being on average about 3'3" and 60 pounds.

Humans are the dominant race in the land of Duris, the most successful
race dominating the vast reaches of the world. Found in nearly every
corner of the land, humans are a varied and undefinable race. Human beings
have a broad range of talents and interests, making each one who decides
on a life of adventure a very unique personality. Bandits, nomads,
farmers, merchants, pirates, adventurers and even cavemen hunters are
examples of human occupations within their diverse societies.

Currently on Duris, the most concentrated populations of humans can be
found near the great city of Verzanan. However, humans are a rugged race
and can be found nearly anywhere on the continent of Elkenshaul.~

Human beings can live to be around 100 years old and they reach maturity
in the mid to late teenage years. Humans come in a variety of body builds
and skin tones, which is examplary of the diversity of the race. Eye color
is highly variable, with blue, brown and green being common. Similarly,
hair color is difficult to predict, with shades of brown, black, red and
blonde often seen. Males tend to be taller (average 5'10") and heavier
(average 170#) than females (average 5'7" and 130#), although there are
often extreme exceptions to these averages.

&+mGENERAL INFORMATION&N
&+m-------------------&N
Mind flayers, also known as Illithids, are a powerful and feared race of the
Underdark, taken to enslaving other races even those as powerful as Drow or
Kuo-Toa. They are extremely arrogant, viewing all other races as cattle to be
fed upon or enslaved. Mind flayers have no social or family structure, their
only concerns being eating, plotting to control the whole of the Underdark and
communication with the communiy through the Elder-Brain (a central telepathic
link between members of an illithid community). Illithids hate sunlight like
most Underdark races, and choose to live in underground cities upkept by their
many slaves.

On Duris, Illithids currently reside deep in the Underdark in the city of
Ixarkon.

&+mRACIAL APPEARANCE&N
&+m-----------------&N
Illithids begin life in a tadpole stage, reared in a pool with the elder brain,
after ten years they emerge as mature adults and can live to be approximately
125 years old. Mind flayers have a mauve-colored skin that glistens with slime.
>From their octopus-like heads sprout four tentacles which are used to attach
the creature to humanoid skulls and draw forth brain matter, upon which they
feed. Their hands have three fingers and a thumb, all with a reddish color.
their eyes are totally white, with no evident pupils and they have no
distinctive growths of hair. Illithids average about 6'0" in height, but only
around 100 pounds in weight, indicating the frailness of their body frame.
Illithids have no sexes, all are hemaphoditic.

&+LGENERAL INFORMATION&N
&+L-------------------&N
Dwarfs are a hardy, unyielding race who prefer living in beautiful mountain
fortresses built of carved stone. Within these cities they practice their crafts
of metallurgy, stone working, and mining to perfection. Most dwarven settlements
are organized into a clan system, usually specializing in one trade or skill.
Good-natured, despite their perpetual grumpiness, dwarves fight chaos and evil
with extraordinairy vigor, putting their finely crafted weapons and armor to
good use.
~
E
page2 2~
&+LRACIAL APPEARANCES&N
&+L------------------&N
Dwarves are considered mature adults around 50 and can live to be nearly 400
years old. They are a short, stout race with generally light brown or greyish
skill color, very similar to the earth and rock they work with. Their eyes
have a bright sheen to them and are often blue or brown. Dwarves wear their
hair long and it is usually colored brown, black or grey. Most dwarves also
maintain well groomed beards and mustaches, considering them a source of pride.
Average heights for dwarves are 4'6" (males) and 4'4 (females), while weights
average 170 lbs for males and 140 lbs for females.

&+yGENERAL INFORMATION&N
&+y-------------------&N
Ogres are considered an extension of the goblinoid races by many learned sages,
distant cousins to such vermin as kobolds, orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears
and trolls. They are commonly members of wandering scavenger bands, making a
living by abmushing, raiding and thievery. Ogre personalities tend to be
extremely violent, covetous and destructive. Seldom can one trust the nature
of an ogre, for they tend to argue over treasure, eat everything in sight, and
be generally disruptive to any group they join. Due to their ravenous natures,
ogres rarely are proficient in any trades or labors, preferring to steal what
they cannot make themselves.

Ogres are often found in the cave regions of the Faang Mountains on the island
of Azursel.
~
E
page2 2~
&+yRACIAL APPEARANCE&N
&+y-----------------&N
Most wandering ogres reach their teens before beginning their traditional roles
as bandits and maurauders and can live to be over 100 years old. Ogres tend to
be very large, dirty and brutish in appearance with hide colored a dirty yellow
and covered with darker bumps. Their teeth and nails can be orange or black and
are generally poorly kept. Ogre eyes are commonly dark purple with white pupils
and their hair is blackish-blue to dark green and usually greasy. Average
heights for ogres are 9'0" (males) and 8'10" (females) and average weights are
350 lbs (males) and 310 lbs (females).

&+GGENERAL INFORMATION&N
&+G-------------------&N
Trolls are a race distantly akin to the goblinoids and are typically found in
marshy caves, dense forests, subterranean areas and abandoned ruins, living in
small hunting packs. However variations of the common 'swamp troll' can be found
in nearly any climate, from arctic to desert. Irregardless of the type of troll,
the race is known for its ferocity, fearlessness and nearly perpetual hunger.
Trolls prefer to avoid daylight and hunt at night, although sunlight causes them
naught but irritation. Trolls appear quite ape-like when they move, walking with
hunched shoulders in a knuckle-dragging gait while they search out prey to
satisfy their ravenous appetites.
~
E
page2 2~
&+GRACIAL APPEARANCE&N
&+G-----------------&N
Trolls can live to be slightly over 100 years old, coming into adulthood
at about 15. Trolls appear very thin and frail, with a rubbery hide which
is colored in green, grey or a mottled green-grey. Their legs and arms are
long and ungainly, but quite strong. Troll eyes are typically sunken and
black, while their hair is a greenish-black to grey writhing mass. Average
heights are 9'0" (males) and 10'0" (females), with average weights being
220 lbs (males) and 250 lbs (females).

First things first.  The main thing to understand when using our version of
ansi color is:  you can SET things, or CLEAR ALL (back to white on black), but
you cannot just turn off bold, or blink.

There are 3 types of ansi control sequences:

&+<color> -  set foreground color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BOLD
             (bright/light) bit is also set (and will STAY set) until either
             a newline, or &<N> is done.
&-<color> -  set background color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BLINK
             bit will be set (same as for &+ above).
&=<bg><fg> - set both background <bg> and foreground <fg> color, exactly the
             same restrictions as for setting foreground and background
             separately.

w - white    l - black    r - red    b - blue    g - green
y - yellow   c - cyan     m - magenta
(+w is normal text, +W is bold text)

book standard god~
This book explains the rules governing standard god eq.

*These objects were created to be sure all god items were unusable by
 mortals, thus &=LRDO NOT&N make any of your god items non-transient
 or not opposed to all alignments. Having the items this way keeps mortals
 from ever abusing them in any fashion.

*You should not have any god items until you can be responsible for the
 commands to string and load the items. Otherwise, you distract other gods
 who may be trying to do serious work.

*Having these objects instead of separate god objects lessens the space
 required in the object files, freeing up space for more standard objects
 with better purposes. Also, these items can be changed whenever you like
 via string and setbit as opposed to a higher level god having to redo the
 object files.

*Gods should ONLY use these items, just in case they should be sac'd, drop
 items or any such mishaps. These items are specifically made unusable by
 mortals where as other loaded items are not.

Also see TIPS
~
E
tips~
These are tips for use of the standard god objects.

1.) If you use tintin or another client, set up aliases or macros to string
    your objects to save time. Dropping your items will and SHOULD destroy
    them.

2.) Object 1211 is the book of Duris ansi codes which describes how to use
    colors in your objects.

3.) Conform your objects to those you want to express your god's ideals.


4.) The standard god objects are vnums #1280 - #1299, insignia are secret (un-
    seeable by mortals) and allow detect good and evil as many gods like that.

Stringing commands:

&+Lstring o <keyword> name <new keyword>&N
