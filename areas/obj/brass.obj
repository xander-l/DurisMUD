githzerai stronghold shannanna parchment piece paper~
At 1st you will need to find the captain because he has the key to the magical door that hides the rift into their realm. He can be bribed for around 500 platinum pieces. Otherwise you will need to complete what other mundane task he needs.
Once you have entered the rift to their realms it will lead you to Limbo. Limbo can be a maze but I just headed east and find the air pocket. Once there looked ahead. Looking ahead will give you hints as to which direction to go next and eventually to the massive red and green Slaad blocking the exit up and out of Limbo.
After you defeat the Slaad take the relic he holds up and into the stronghold. The path is littered with creatures that protect the stronghold but you need to find the choosen one. Defeat him and move through the tunnels which can be a bit tricky and annoying. The stairs continue to a huge shadow monster guarding the second relic. Pick up the 2nd relic and move into the rift at the end of the stairs.
Now you are just outside the fortress of the githzerai. The watch leader guards the gates but does not hold the key. He holds the 3rd and last relic needed to trade for the fortress gate key. The spirit of Zerthimon will trade for the key and can be found wandering the black land mass.
After you have gained the key from the spirit he is of no more use so is best to slay him since you will need his heart as a sacrifice for final entrance.
Once inside you will be in the foyer with 3 directions to choose from. I prefer left to right as I am left handed. So the west past has 1 switch you must get to, then move on to the north path. On the north path there are 3 switches to pull, then move onto the last path to the east.
After you have headed east there is a fork you will want to stay west on. Find the statue and bow before it. It moves you to a tunnel with rooms of the old kings. Inside you will need to take the rings from their graves, 5 in all. Those goto the prophet for key. You will find 4 levers inside and suggest you pull each 1 on your way out of the tunnels.
Once you have gained the key from the prophet continue to the east path and find the mirror.
Stare into the mirror and move north, two west, and three north for the Vortex. Go down and finish that area and pull the final lever inside the orb. Return to the foyer for the final battle.
Head down from the foyer to Tayr-dryn and he requires the heartstone for access to his Throne Room. Ya will need to bleed on the altar to get it to move and unlock it with the shadow.

Good Luck!

P.S. You need to know these names at some point, Rrakkma, Raylen, Kraange, Tayr-dryn.

apocalypse castle shanaanaa parchment piece paper note notes~
Apocalypse Castle

Special Note: Its highly suggested that you have a conjurer who can prismatic cube, or two people who can make walls will surfice.

The Keeper at the entrance to the castle wants the skulls of the horsemen.

There is a portal you enter to get to the castle which puts you at the center of the Scorched Plains, and the 1st room is safe. Upon the plains is a blue slab that is four west and five south of the safe room. It will be hidden and needs to be pushed to move forward.

The signpost marks another safe room and east/southeast of it is a zombie who is looking for a old bracelet if you find it. North of the signpost is a deadly vampire who guards the center of town and access to the only portable room inside. The old bracelet is in the rocks just below the center of town.

There is many different items that can be collected but to move towards the end you will need to find 2 keys to the castle. These two keys are found on the warmaster west of center in the training center and one of the patrol leaders carries the other to the north.

Once you have collected the two keys head straight north to the castle from the center of town. The spectral knight holds the next key to the inner castle. You may have to provoke them to follow you.

Now that your in the castle find the Garden and the groundskeeper with the keys the four towers where each horsemen resides. It is guarded by wyrms and hydra's so watch your step. Take the keys and head to the towers which are on the east and west side.

Once inside and looking to slay the horsemen you should know that the horsemen do not chase but his dragon-horse does, so better to seperate them. Slay each of the four horsemen and just east of the garden is a secret path back to the keeper and the reward.

Good Luck!

P.S. Inside the castle you may find some unordinary visitors.

   Quelranor: Lightning Sword

   Mimir: Golden Amulet
   Drow Emissary: Tankard of Ale
   Alchemist: Clump of Fireweed

Jotunheim can be found off Astral Plane.

Once you have entered the cold mountainous area you want to find the Icy Waterfall to the east. After going up the waterfall to the north is the Thyrm castle but you will need the key from Loki to gain access to his throne room. To the south is the mages camp which you need to know their dieties name, Kostchtchie, to gain access here.

To the east are the walls of Utgard. On the west side is a secret entrance I always use. The password is silverwing. Head east through and pay no attention to the fake Loki but instead find the hidden area above him where he is truely hidden. Claim the key from him and return to the castle of Thyrm.

Now that you have the key to the throne area just kill his guards and jarls then deal with his high priest. The God Thyrm can freeze you if he is directly engaged with you but its only temperary so be careful! He is cocky and will not chase you but instead mock you.

Good Luck!

P.S. Explore all of the hills for the out of the ordinary creatures.

lair gibberling king shanaanaa parchment piece paper note notes~
The Lair of the Gibberling King

Hidden at the door to the entrance is its own key. If you can, move through the 1st area invisible, it will make it much easier. Regardless you will need to move south/southeast and find the high priest G'graz. He holds a key to a secret entrance in his room. Follow through that secret to and up the Waterfall.

Once at the top of the waterfall you enter a Grotto. Head four north and two west to find the troll corpse that marks the hidden entrance towards the kings room.

There are numberous ropers and elementals that wander the grotto so you may consider clearing many of them because they can become overwelming at times. From the hidden entrance in the grotto you will need to continue down. Before you move on however you will need to know the following:

All of creatures here will chase you if you attack them in any way so its best to use this to your advantage because they are a strong horde in numbers but are weak alone.

When standing at the boulder below the grotto you must push it out of your way.
The next few rooms are packed with the Blood Horde. I like to have my conjurer send a couple elementals to block for another person who can cast a quick spell, like magic missile, onto one of the Horde members and return before getting attacked. He is instructed to die and not to flee if he does get engaged as he could flee further inside and make it difficult to move on.

Continue this pattern through the remainder of the tunnels including the room with the dracolich Crymson.

Once you have defeated Crymson you will need to return to the Entrance of the Grotto to portal if needed.

Good Luck!

P.S. Assign each of the people who have a takedown skill onto different numbers of the horde to avoid them casting spells.

P.S.S. Roshen sometimes visits the Grotto and carries a wand of dismissal. Claim it and quest it with Crymson's essence to the elemental noble south of the boulder.

Mazzolin

Find the Throne Room of Mazzolin, it is north through the hallway and up the grad stairs. The king, queen, and warlord will not attack you so do not worry. There is a hidden entrance in the throne room behind the large map. To unlock it say, Mazzolin.

Head below the throne room and deal with the stormtroopers there. You will need a thief to pick the lock down into the sewers or someone large enough to bash the door.

When you enter the sewers you will come to a just a couple forks in the path. The 1st one you come to, stay south.
The 2nd one you come to, stay south.
The 3rd one you come to, stay east.
The 4th one you come to, stay south.

This path will take you directly to the end with a dragon who guards the rune stone.

The other paths are dead ends but may have hematite shards. The shards were pieces of a star that belong to Aeirayne. She is a Grey Elf who was captured and resides north of the stormtroopers. She will reward you if you return all five shards for the sleeves of zephyrs.

If you end up on the Blasted Plain of Rock find the pool of tar, not the pool of acid, and it will return you to the entrance of the hallway you began in.

Good Luck!

P.S. In the sewers are blugrul of various spellcasting abilities. They can overwelm you and need to be taken down so procede with caution.

P.S.S. The hematite orbs are hidden in area's that seem that there is no escape. Rub them to escape.

Shadamehr Keep

It can be found on the Ethereal Plane near the Void in Time inside the Dreggan Woods.

From the Void in Time you need to move east, two north, and 1 west to enter the Dreggan Woods.

From the Entrance to Dreggan Woods follow these directions as you can easily get lost in them:

Eight North
Two East
Five North
One West
Two East
Two North
Six East
Three North
Two East
Two North

This will get you to the Entrance to Shadamehr Keep. It is very vacant due to the beholder who holds the key to the formal hallway. Behind the door is a shadow dragons lair who guards the key for Merkus the death knights abode.

Merkus is protected by two banshee who follow him if he is chases his attacker but can be lured into chasing someone who can use a damage over time type spell against them.

If someone is huge or bigger they maybe have some success bashing Merkus but his abode is a specially designed room and has the same elements of the plane of fire.

Good Luck!

P.s. Try to disarm him if he is wielding, and search his vault for treasure.

Celestial Plane

There is access to Celestial Plane on both the Astral Plane and Ethereal Plane. You will need to find the portal blazing with brilliant divine energy that moves about the planes.

Things you need to know beforehand:
The creatures are color coded to help you recognize which ones you will need to slay. If you are a part of Good Races then you will want to slay the red and black creatures, and if you are part of Evil Races you will want to slay the blue and white creatures.

There is one portable room named Cosmic Storm.
There is a glowing portal that will send you to the Astral Plane.

These are the Directions from the different Landmarks found on the Plane:
FROM PORTAL: To Cosmic 2nw,To Tear n2wu, To Vortex d2en, To Stream 2n3end, To Rift de.
FROM COSMIC: to portal e2s, To Tear wsu, to vortex 2wds, To Stream 4end, To Rift 2e2sd
FROM TEAR: to portal d2es, to cosmic dne, to vortex wu, to rift s2wu
FROM VORTEX: to portal s2wu, to cosmic nu3e, to tear ed, to rift sw
FROM STREAM: to portal us3w2s, to cosmic us4w
FROM RIFT: to portal wu, to cosmic u2w2n

To begin you will need to find 1 of 2 white devils that has a hellish crystal. This crystal unlocks the door hidden in A Tear in Celestia which can be uncovered by entering the rift in the room. Continue Up into the rift with caution.
   The rift has many devils and at its end is Cerberus who holds the next key a sliver of anti-matter. After claiming the sliver move north and up to return to the grid.

Next you will want to move to the Vortex of Dark Matter which is west and up from the Tear room. By entering vortex it will uncover the door you will unlock with the sliver. Some of the rooms in this section are underwater and some are magic dead areas. Take your time moving down through this area as it can be difficult. You need to kill Saggitarius A* for a splintered life shard to unlock the next area. To leave this area you move 3 down and 1 up after slaying him to get to the grid.

Return to the Cosmic Storm which is east, north, up, 3 east after returning to grid. From there you need to reach the A Variance in the Life Stream. This is four east, north, and down from the Cosmic Storm.

Once at the Life Stream begin by entering lifestream to reveal the door you will use the shard to unlock with. In this area there are some creatures that are not aggressive and none of them will chase you so take your time moving through. At the end of the current is a group of creatures you can slay that protect a door to their south. Enter the room through the door and each person in your group will need to manually move down to get to the next section even though a exit does not exist.

You should now be in the Palace of the Titans. Here you will need to collect keys moving back and forth from one area and back to the same one. There are 4 towers on the outer wall and they will be opened in the following order, NW, SE, SW, and NE.

The key for the NW tower is on a titan all north from the room you entered from the Stream. Collect the key from the tower guardian and return to the door that the titan who had the key for the NW Tower was standing in front of. Unlock and move inside to slay Atlas. Up and West of Atlas is a guard post where 1 of the guards holds the next key for the SE tower. Collect that key and get the key from the SE tower guardian and return to Atlas' room.
After the SE tower take its key to the room Up, South, Up, East from Atlas' room and slay the statue and collect its key. Take the statue's key to the SW tower and slay its guardian.
Once you have collected the SW tower guardian's key return to Atlas' room and move Up, South, Up, and North. Destroy the titan magistrate, Metatron to the west, and Cronus to the north. Take the key and collect the NE tower guardian's key and return to Metatron's room to unlock the last door. Inside the room north of Metatron's is a statue you need to rub to return to the Celestia Wargrounds grid.

The last section is the Deep Blue Rift which is South, East, and Down after rubbing the statue. You need to enter the rift to reveal the hidden entrance and use the blue shard to unlock it. Continue down into the rift killing the different souls that are disguised as common creatures. You will find the creature Malevolence behind a door at its ends. He is not difficult but can transport those who are engaged on it back onto the Wargrounds grid. Once he is destroyed search for the final room.

Good Luck!

P.S. It is highly suggested that you clear as many of your opposing creatures off the wargrounds grid as you can.

The Sky city of Ultarium

What you need to know:
  This place will repopulate while you are still inside.
  Bring atleast 200 platinum.

Begin by finding the Heavens Plaza with its beautiful sparkling fountain.
From there you will need to search the room two south of it for a secret
entrance. Use the entrance and head into Grudat's Storeroom and purchase
the sunstone key. Then return to the Plaza.

The Gates of Appollyon Fortress is three south and far to the east from
the plaza. Use the key to obtain entrance to the fortress. The entry hall
has several agressive guards and dogs so use caution. Straight to your
east are the stairs to the next level but you will need to gain the key
from the lieutenant who resides in his room in the southeast corner of
the hall.

Upon claiming the second floor key you should still use caution moving
onto the second floor as it is packet with more guards. the bottom of the
third floor stairwell is just to your east. Once you have gained access
to the third story the number of guards are sparce, however Blaze the
council guardian is a very capable fighter. He is known for his whip
named "Cometstrike."

Above him is Plume Meteorhand the siegemaster who holds the key to the
councilors hallway. Deal with him and return to the guardians room where
Blaze stands. Use caution continuing east from here. There are some
attendants and councilors who can be a tough fight if they swarm you.
You will want to claim each soul from Ignor, Strata, Zeenium, and Omoona.

When you are ready to leave the council chambers you can stomp the pad on
the balcony.

Good Luck!

P.S. There are a few people who want the souls of those four. The most
popular is the Pandora Box. The creature can be found behind a statue
that is at the end of a mountain trail that is just south of the Gates
of Appollyon Fortress. You will need to touch the statue to gain access.

Arachdrathos Guilds (Drow)

Well how you begin this can be interesting and require some understanding
on the layout of the Drow's hometown but the actual guilds are located
in the web's below the town. Once you have gained access to the webs try
and get a feel for them. They do repeat and seem endless. For example, if
you move east or west continuously you will be moving up or down layers
of the web. There are intersections in the web that allow quicker access
up and down the web and act as short cuts when moving from one house to
the other. Inside the web are drow teachers which can be a challenge to
fight but are avoidable using the intersections.

Things you need to know:
   There are five houses you need to visit, and each have two switches
   that you must activate. There is an order to the houses as well which
   I will pass onto you but so you know the switches open up rooms inside
   the other houses that hold the switches for other houses and so forth.

   Also, there are traps in place in certain objects, like chests, that
   can put everything in the room to sleep. I have not found anything
   worthwhile inside so do as you will with them.

&+CThe first house you must find is the House Olipth. These are sorcerer and
&+Cconjurers who make residance here and will fight be defend it. They have
&+Cmade a series of keys to ensure the saftey of the switches so you must
&+Copen each door with the previous key to gain the next. Find and push the
&+Ctwo switches then move on to the next house.

&+rThe second house you visit is that of warriors and the Zochra Keep. It is
&+rguarded by two golems and once you enter past the golems you can not
&+rreturn the way you came. They too have several keys, many are false, but
&+ryou need to claim the right one to move forward toward the switches at
&+rthe top of the keep. You can leave the keep one of two ways, the easiest
&+ris all down at the Adamantine Stairs. The second is past the Warmaster
&+rand his trap room south of the Landing. Just east of the warmaster is an
&+ralcove with a pool. Enter it and return to the front gates of the house.

&+mNext is the House Ilith filled with priests. The high priest holds the
&+mkey to the tower on the west side with a switch and on the east side is
&+manother switch you must push. Here with a bit of stealth and magic you
&+mcan avoid many of the inhabitants.

&+gHouse of Slin holds the masters of assassins and his followers. His chef
&+ghides the key to the masters chambers and can be found on the west side
&+gof the Commons. To the east is a forgotten room in the recreation area
&+gwhich holds the next switch. After you pressed both move to the next house.

&+WHere can be the most difficult of the houses. Necromancers call this place
&+Whome in the house of Sa'Zarn. The drows inside do not move around but will
&+Wchase you if you make them angry. This could be used to your advantage.
&+WUp into the house are the two switches your looking for as well as the
&+Wthrone room of Zargenenon the vampire.
*SPECIAL NOTE* You should avoid at all costs going all down inside this
house as it leads to the Dungeons of Abominations and mostlikely certain
death. If you get stuck in the dungeons and survive the tentamorts your
only path to freedom rests further down.

&+yAfter you have visited all five houses your final destination is the House
&+yof Zarbonesti. It has two entrances an east and west which both lead to
&+ythe same end so it matters not which one you find first. Using some form
&+yof invisibility you can avoid some of the first few guards but you eventually
&+ywill need to find the Shrine of Lolth and kill the cleric with the key to
&+ythe door to the east and the final battle. After dispatching the arch cleric
&+ythere is a narrow tunnel where a shade hides and is renown for being the
&+ypossessor of the jewel of the spider queen.

Good Luck!

P.S. The Warmaster wears the platemail of might and can be challenging to gain.

P.S.S. There is a room you can cast Gate from near the web near the backdoor.

The Transparent Tower

Things you need to know:
  Inside the Tower are teleporter traps that are between rooms which send
you to different places within the Tower.
  Most of the creatures inside the Tower are undead so use apprioate spells.
  There is a librarian who is looking for 3 &+mpurple tokens&n and a &+Wscepter&n and
will trade you these for a key to the Storage Closet with a lot of gear.
However, to obtain the tokens you need you have to take the scepter hidden
by Aceralde to each of the three Lords of the Tower.
  When give a Lord the scepter they return it to you hidden with a token
as well so you can put all of your inventory into a container to search for
it so that you can give it to the next Lord.

Once you enter into the Tower you have a difficult time leaving as it
begins in a Maze with Strange Lights and Prisms. But if you are brave
enough to venture inside you will want to head to the south and find
a &+bstrange blue prism&n. To move forward you need to stare into the prism.

Now you have reached the Tranlucent grid where there may be some mists
that can be waiting for you. Depending on what abilities in your group
you have you can either try to wall quickly north, south, east, and
west, or immediately after you stare into the prism move up one room.
Either way you will want to avoid moving up into the Illithid above
and clear out some of the mists on the grid, just do not enter doors.
For now!

Next there is an &+Millithid&n and a &+Gmisty fog&n who stand guard of the next
passage just above. I prefer to seperate them since they are both
agressive and will chase you. I like to do this by sending a summoned
pet into them and have a quick spell caster use magic missile upon the
misty fog and then move back down to our group. He chases and we slay.
After that I like to lure the illithid away from his room because there
is a trapped room to the east of him. This way incase my members need
to flee and memorize they can do it without going into the trap.

Collect the key from the illithid and the nice visor made of misty on
the fog and go south of the Landing of Green Mist to the door east.
Use the key and slay the mist inside the room. This comfortable room
allows people to use portal spells to gain or leave as necessary. A key
is left by the mist found here and opens a door to Aceralde's Room.

Next is dealing with aceralde and his followers. His room is up above
the Landing of Green Mist. This is another place using a summoned pet
can be of use. It is a good idea to seperate aceralde's lich and vampire
followers from him and bringing them one at a time. Each of them can
be knocked down to prevent them from casting spells so use this to your
advantage. Aceralde can also be knocked down and sometimes has some
dracolich pets so deal with these how best fits for your group but he
will track you down if you do not kill him so be careful.

Once you have defeated aceralde collect his key and unlock his desk
that is east of his Sitting Room. There is a &+Wscepter&n hidden inside and
is sought after by three seperate Lords.

&+MTaking the scepter to Lisa is the easist and is on the east path from the
&+MLanding of Green Mist. At the end of Lady Lisa's path you are teleported
&+Mback to the Pillars grid below the Landing of Green Mist.

There are two doors on the east side of this grid which both lead to more
difficult places.

&+GThe Green door is the southern most of the two and is the least difficult
&+Gof the two. Lord Gullivier resides inside and is protected by shadowy
&+Gmonsters and a blue dragon. Once you have entered the Green Door and move
&+Gwest through the teleporter trap you end up in an open field that has a
&+Ggreen pedestal at its center. This pedestal can give you an escape from
&+Ghere if needed just by crying upon it. If your strength is strong you can
&+Gdefeat the shadowy monsters and find the hidden passage to the north. Past
&+Gthe blue dragon you will find the Lord and a teleporter back to the Pillar
&+Ggrid.

&+rThe Red Door leads to a small Plane of Avernus and is loaded with devils,
&+rblobs, and pit fiends. Only the blobs can be knocked down and are very
&+rdangerous. I highly suggest having a conjurer with you who can make walls.
&+rMove through here carefully, but once you have fought your way onto the Plane
&+ryou need to find the Lord who resides just north, east, and down. He  too
&+rwants the scepter orginating from Aceralde's desk. After you have turned the
&+rscepter over to Lord Devilish head as far east as you can to a door. The
&+rdoor requires a password, ILLUSION. Open and go through it. You will need
&+rto move back east which will teleport you back onto the Pillar grid.

&+mLastly you need to visit the librarian. There is a short cut teleporter
&+mand it is found two south of the center of the Pillar grid. Make your way
&+mdown to the librarian and complete the quest by given him the 3 tokens
&+mand the scepter. To leave the librarian just move north and read the book
&+mtitled &+Y"Light and Illusion&n."

The door given by the librarian goes to the door locked north at the Landing
of Green Mist. Defeat the two mists inside and find the secret door inside.
Speak the word REALITY to unlock it, and you will gain access to the closet
full of treasure.

Good Luck!

P.S. Many of the equipment is hidden so search, and find the belt west of
of the Landing of Green Mist behind the door.
