strange dark pool water~
   &+bWithin the vasts kingdom waters, this strange dark pool rests
&+bhere, looking extremely out of place.  Small ripples run across the
&+btop of the two-dimensional pool.
   &+bThe pool strangely leaves no shadow anywhere below it, and cannot
&+bbe felt with one's hands.  The dark water never seems to move or be
&+bdistrupted.  The tint of the waters are like a dark ale, and the pool
&+bis much too small for anyone to attempt to swim through or enter.

in the shape of sea horses with their tails joined together at the base.
Intricate symbols run down the length of the shaft hinting mysterious
powers bound to the item by Poseidon, king of the sea. Stories fortell of
great storms and giant waves caused by the gods terrible rage as he thrusts
the trident into the ocean floor or raises it to summon hurricane winds.

body, each having been fit into ideal positions for maximum comfort,
protection, and durability.   The scales seem to have a magical push when
near lightning and cold.
