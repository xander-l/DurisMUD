&+Y   Gone are the days that my forest will again see the true rays of the sun
&+Yor the calming beams of the moon.  Since Goldrym has grown in power and began
&+Yto try and change the ways of nature and use it to his advantage, all hell
&+Yhas broken lose.  His expirements have wreaked havok on the natural order of
&+Yevents in the wilderness.  Many of the species that once survived alongside
&+Yeach other are no longer peaceful.  I must find a way to put an end to the slow
&+Ydestruction of the High Moor, and travel to the ruins in hopes of defeating the
&+Ydefiler of my home and love...  Wish me well Yingin, I fear for my safety.
