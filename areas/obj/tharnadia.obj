&+Y                               The Holy Code of Honor
&+Y
&+Y     It is so written that the honor of every knight holds thee to thy course
&+Y       in life, protects thee in times of peril, and guides thee to restore
&+Y      peace and goodness to the world.  The laws of knighthood bind thee to
&+Y     thine gods, and lead thee to thy ultimate glory of the afterlife.  Read
&+Y                 well these laws, and make them a part of thy life:
&+Y
&+Y          1) Thou shalt never kill another adventurer in cold blood.
&+Y          2) Thou shalt not steal from another adventurer, and shall always
&+Y               return those goods lost by others to their rightful owner.
&+Y          3) Thou shalt not flee from battle if there is even the slightest
&+Y                   chance for victory, for thy bravery is thy honor.
&+Y          4) Thou shalt help the weak and poor, or anyone whom has less than
&+Y                  thee, for the meek are the warriors of the future.
&+Y          5) Thou shalt perform no deed of malice or greed, savagery or hate,
&+Y              or any other act of evil that might tarnish thy code of honor.
&+Y
&+Y      It is by these simple laws that we bind our faith, and fight together
&+Y     for the cause of good and peace.  Those that stray from it, are forever
&+Y                     damned from the holy light of the gods...
&+Y
&+Y                                 So speaks the code
&+Y .   .. ________________________________________________________________ ..   .

&+L                  few words, If we may, to those of you who are
&+L                  new to Tharnadia.  We welcome you to visit the

&+L                  where you will find most of our fine shops and
&+L                  our modern court system.  To the east you may
&+L                  want to check out the Great Bazaar, where those
&+L                  merchants from the surrounding providences,
&+L                  hawk their goods.  Surrounding the twin keeps
&+L                  you can find our docks and our park.  These
&+L                  places are both exquisite and we urge you to
&+L                  check them out.  A warning though, although
&+L                  we take great pains to keep vandalism and crime
&+L                  at bay, like any city, we have our trouble
&+L                  areas.  The southwest portion of town is one
&+L                  such place.  Please, for your own safety, steer
&+L                  clear of that area.  If you do wander there, it

large steel cuffs that bind its occupant's hands and feet.  A small winch
beneath the seat causes the victim's legs to be thrust apart up to two hundred
and seventy degrees.  A leather strap, on the head rest, allows for the seated
individual to be blindfolded.  Just in front of the winch, a water-suction
device is attached to a long clear tube and a funnel.  This instrument can
then be placed over the occupant's penis, while small static-electrodes are
placed within his flesh.  All in all this machine does not look to
pleasureable, but it is the brothel specialty.  A small pool of cum has
accumulated at the rack's base, having oozed from the hydro-suction pump.&n

                         &+RDon't Be a Fool, Close the Book.
                         &+R   Its Full of Nothing But
                         &+R            Lies!

   In the beginning there was nothing.  Just vast empty space, rolling away
into the darkness, yet never getting anywhere.  Finally, nothing got bored and
created something.  That something was, is, Duris.  But nothing was no good at
playing god, and made many mistakes when trying to make the mud stand.  Some
mud was evil, some mud was good, but all in all the mud was confused.  One day
good mud fought evil mud, and they both split into many different muds.  Duris
became overcrowded.  This is the story of one good mud named Kaynor.

   Kaynor was a mud of integrity, he was one of the first knights to use the
name Paladin.  This paladin mud walked far and near, fought many evil mud, and
amassed much shiny metal wealth.  He fell in love with a mud woman who called
herself Tharnadia.  They married, and went off to found a mudslide.  However,
the woman mud became sick, she began to dry out until finally she was just
dirt (and dirt unlike mud can't talk).  Kaynor became upset and spent all his
shiny metal building a city in honor of her.  This city was small for although
he had lots of shiny metal, it didn't go that far back then.  In time this
mud, too, became dirt that doesn't speak.  And they buried him incase he
decided he could speak (people fear talking dirt).  In time the city grew, and
they built a stronghold to lock away their prisoners.  This they called Caer
Tannud.  As more and more poeple came, a second keep was errected to house the
government.  This keep they named Caer Dauthe.  And so it was for four hundred
years, until Duris got angry.  He shook with all his might to be rid of the
mud that talks.  Many mud did indeed turn to dirt, but some mud survived.

   The city and its keeps, did too survive, although now the keeps were five
thousand feet above the city.  One of the keeps moved to an island mesa,
prefering the economically stable waterfront property, while the city decided
to drop twenty feet below its roads.  But the walking mud did not care, they
moved right back into the buildings, and built new roads.  And so it has been
for nearly three thousand years.  And walking mud still turns to static dirt,
except sometimes static dirt does indeed decide to talk.

&+g                          The Law of the Woodsman

&+g      * A ranger will protect the woods and all who reside there.
&+g      * A ranger must always fight for good, and never fall into the
&+g            dark ways of evil.
&+g      * A ranger should always help those in need, or any goodhearted
&+g            person who has less than you.
&+g      * A ranger shall know the ways of the world, travel far and wide
&+g            through distant lands, and learn them so as to be a learned
&+g            scout.
&+g      * A ranger shall always be welcome amongst creatures of the forest,
&+g           and will know the skills of woodland stealth and surprise.
&+g      * A ranger who carries extra food should always leave some in the
&+g           trees for other fellow rangers to find who may be hungry.
&+g           These secret places may be hollow trees, bushes, or small cabins.
&+g      * A ranger's greatest task is to destroy those evil beings in the
&+g           world who would seek to harm or destroy the woods and those
&+g           who live there.  This is sworn revenge of every ranger..
&+g      * And a warning; Those rangers who have fallen from the light of
&+g           goodness and purity, will be struck by the gods and lose all
&+g           of their ranger abilities, becoming a mere fighter, stripped
&+g           of honor.  Always stay within the light of goodness!

water fountain daedalian onyx~
&+L   This bi-level fountain was created shortly after the construction of the
&+LGreat Spanning Bridge, as a tribute to the people who kept the city of
&+WTharnadia&+L alive.  A magnificent &+Wglass orb&+L is supported, about five feet off
&+Lthe ground, by an onyx psuedotree.  The ebon trunk splits into four leafless
&+Lbranches, each in one of the cardinal points, which hold fast the globe.  The
&+Lglass sphere has four holes drilled into its base, evenly spaced between the
&+Lflanking branches, and its top has been completely cut off.  A strong stream
&+Lof &+Bwater&+L is forced up the center of the stone pillar, through the bottom of
&+Lthe glass and into the air, where it falls back into the clear bowl of the
&+Lupper fountain.  About half the orb stays full at any given time, as the rest
&+Lpours out the perferations in its base, cascading in small waterfalls down
&+Linto the lower fountain.  Statues sit facing the four winds.  An &+Wangel&+L gazes
&+Lto the east and west, while &+wgargoyles&+L peer to the north and south.&n

T - Tharnadia - Fun times in the big city!

W - Woodseer - Smaller than Tharnadia but the halflings are a lot of fun!  A lot of small strange creatures in the Jungle outside make some nice practice though, especially the elusive bullywugs if you can find them!

O - Twin Towers - A nice scenic get-a-way from city life.  Filled with small and friendly woodland creatures.

A - Ako - A woodland teaming with small woodland wildlife surrounding a sleepy little village.  Great place to visit in your early adventures!

V - Vella's Bordello - Now who couldn't find some fun here?!  Tip some of the women here a few gold coins and they will follow you anywhere!

Z - Turopolis - Use to be a great place to visit, but falling apart lately and inhabitted by slimes and other strange creatures.  The zoo in the northeast corner is still working though, and is DEFINATELY worth visiting.

B - Bridge - The river is very wide at this point, meaning this is the only available place to cross.  This large bridge spans east/west with horse stables lying through gates to the north and south along the way to speed travel.  Beware the kobolds that lie in wait of unwary adventurers!

D - The Tharnadian Docks - Once you save up some spare cash you can build the ship of your dreams and sail to distant lands.. or build a warship and sink other people doing that!

thick sharp sword~
This sword is one of thousands city armories make for its new recruits.  The speed needed to make such a large amount usually means little time is available to give them a sharp edge, but this one seems to have been redone, giving it a polished and sharp edge.

This incredibly tiny wolf pup is curled up and resting peacefully, and even when picked up isn't disturbed from his slumber.  It is no wonder that he was able to escape his master's room so easily, he could almost be confused for a rabbit because of his small size.  There is little doubt that he will one day grow into a large and powerful hunter however.

T - Tharnadia - Fun times in the big city!

W - Woodseer - Smaller than Tharnadia but the halflings are a lot of fun!  A lot of small strange creatures in the Jungle outside make some nice practice though, especially the elusive bullywugs if you can find them!

O - Twin Towers - A nice scenic get-a-way from city life.  Filled with small and friendly woodland creatures.

A - Ako - A woodland teaming with small woodland wildlife surrounding a sleepy little village.  Great place to visit in your early adventures!

V - Vella's Bordello - Now who couldn't find some fun here?!  Tip some of the women here a few gold coins and they will follow you anywhere!

Z - Turopolis - Use to be a great place to visit, but falling apart lately and inhabitted by slimes and other strange creatures.  The zoo in the northeast corner is still working though, and is DEFINATELY worth visiting.

B - Bridge - The river is very wide at this point, meaning this is the only available place to cross.  This large bridge spans east/west with horse stables lying through gates to the north and south along the way to speed travel.  Beware the kobolds that lie in wait of unwary adventurers!

D - The Tharnadian Docks - Once you save up some spare cash you can build the ship of your dreams and sail to distant lands.. or build a warship and sink other people doing that!
