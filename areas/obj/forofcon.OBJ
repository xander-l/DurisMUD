&+yThe journal is worn and the parchment old and brittle.  None the less it is

&+yjournal.
&n
&+wYear of the Stag, day 111
&+w   Gerik Desatysso the sorceror of Burnstone, contrcted my old companions
&+wof the Band of the Hand to accompany me on my quest to discover the true
&+wtomb of the ancients, the tomb of Mealdrun.  After months of study I feel
&+wconfident that my information will lead us to magic and treasure,
&n
&+yThe journal goes on at this point to describe the party that went with
&+yDesatuysso, Falon and his company.  It also describes in detail the troubles
&+ythe mage went through to get any information on this elusive tomb.
&n
&+wDay 119
&+w   Sather and Lyla seem to never get along.  It didn't help in the morning
&+wto find Lyla riffling through Sather backpack for components.  Our travel
&+wthrough the swamp has been difficult and wearing on everyone's nerve.
&n
&+yIt goes on to describe the tedious task of them trudging through a swamp
&+ywith each other to deal with.  The following passage gives something
&+yinteresting.
&n
&+wDay 123
&+w   We made camp at the foot of this flat-topped hill.  I knew we were close
&+wto our goal.  This might be the entrance to the tomb.
&+wWhen the light of day illuminated the hill the next morning we noticed
&+wthat the piles of rocks on the hill were arranged to give the entire hill
&+wthe resemblance of a grinning skull.
&n
&+yFor a while the journal continues with tales of different but obscure things.
&+yA triple entrance, a mammoth elephant, a four large gargoyle, riddles, and
&+ysecret passages, many of them.  Each tells a vague story of the tomb, but
&+yno clues as to what or where it is.  As each passage is read more injury
&+yand death comes to the party.  Sather loses a leg, and Grunthar a hand to
&+ya devil face.  Near the end of this tragedy a small clue reveals perhaps
&+ywhat one is looking for, a record from Mealdrun's own handwriting was found
&+yby Desatysso in his studies.
&n
&+wDay 128
&+w   Mealdrun was a hybrid of a human mother and a being of the lower planes.
&+wInstead of discarding the deformed child Mealdrun's mother loved him in a
&+wway only a mother could.  This idyllic existance ended when villagers,
&+wfrightened by the boys appearance, put a torch to the house and killed the
&+wboys mother.  He only survived due to his cambionic nature.  In the years
&+wthat followed Mealdrun barely survived to adulthood.  He took up sorcery
&+wand necromancy in his studies.  With the death of his mother and others
&+walways shunning him away any goodness that was given by his mother was soon
&+wlost and his quest toward lichdom began.  In his logs he mentions an amulet
&+wthat was forged with his magic.  The curious thing about it is a passage I
&+wfound withing his scriptures, "and so in the fullness of time I shall cast
&+wthe amulet out in to the lands of Men, that it may draw those of proper
&+wmettle.  Only those of the keenest luck and greatest skill will win through
&+wto me in my ultimate Fortress of Conclusion.  There they will rewarded for
&+wtheir persistence."
&+W   As you can probably imagine, this greatly intrigued me.  With some more
&+wresearch, a long arduous search I ultimately gained the amulet of the void
&+wthat I now gaze upon.  Such a simple key to decipher it, so devilishly
&+wclever it was.  For all those who follow me apply this key to the amulet:
&+wsubtract three then read, there are two exceptions, but not troublesome ones.
&+w   It all has led to this.  I regret nothing.  When my pen leaves this page,
&+wI shall step foward through the portal, leaving behind this log and the
&+wamulet for those with the bravery to follow me.
&n
&+yThat is the end of the journal, but one other entry was made as apparently
&+ya cleric named Sather was given the logs and the amulet before the mage
&+ywent to the fortress.
&n
&+cThe wizard is now gone.
&+che led me and mine to our doom.  he gives me this journal and this amulet
&+cas if it makes up for the &+Closs of everyone&n&+c and everything I hold dear.  I
&+cspit upon him.  I hope he finds nothing but death.  I stand now outside the
&+ctomb, looking at the lonely hill of one long undead, one left better off
&+cundisturbed.  I have cast the amulet in the tomb, sealing it so no other
&+cwill suffer.  My goddess has abandoned me, and I can find not a single
&+cshred of compassion for any that walk on two legs.  &+CLeast of all&n&+c I carry
&+cout the last wishes of he who I despise above all others: &+CDesatysso.&n

&n
&+w   The few notes of interest are as follows...
&n
&+y . Mealdrun's Tomb is only the first and least of his holdings.
&+y . Mealdrun's Tomb was sunk into the underdark for reasons unknown.
&+y . Mealdrun labors on another place to bring about a grand change.
&+y . Mealdrun long ago prepared a single route to access his true abode.
&+y . To travel this route one needs the &+LAmulet of the Void&n&+y.
&+y . The runes inscribed on the &+LAmulet of the Void&n&+y are in a forgotten
&+y     magical tongue.  If one could learn this lost language, one could
&+y     decipher the runes.

note~
&+wThe note found is a page torn from a journal.  A date at the top of the page
&+wputs this parchment at eighty-three years old.  Could there have been a group
&+wof brave adventurers before Desatysso's arrival some seventy-three years
&+wprior?  After the date an entry was made, most likely the last one.&n
&n
&n
&+y   I were foolish to think we could venture in here so unprepared.  Now
&+ywith all our resources spent and no treasure to be found we are cornered.
&+yThe mist of death follows us at every turn of this damned city.  It now
&+yapproaches to consume us, make us part of its own.  The priest can hold
&+yoff the horror for a while with his spells, this will give me time to complete
&+wmy repairs to the portal.
&+y   I write this in an attempt to thwart any others from coming here.  There
&+yis no gold, no treasure, and no life here.  Leave this forsaken place before
&+yyou also are consumed by its undeath.  I am finishing repairs on one of the
&+yportals in this Chamber of Days.  This will lead anyone back to the realm
&+yof man.  Touch the noon panel and return to your homes.  There is no time for
&+yme as I must maintain the portal for my associates and make sure it stays
&+Yopen for those that follow.
&+y   I beg for their forgiveness in my lack of insight traveling to this place.
&+yEach are heros and I hope, no pray, that Walkarr, Alena, and Delbious return
&+ysafely, may the gods bless them.
