skeleton~
   This &+Wskeleton&n appears to be from a &+Chuman,&n or some type of human-like being.
It lies half buried in &+ymud, &+Gmoss&n growing over part of it.  A close examination
reveals that part of the right leg is missing, and large &+Wteeth&n marks show that
it was a &+Clarge creature&n that bit it off in one bite.

carcass~
&+g   Something large has killed a big cat, but has eaten only part of it.  Most&n
&+gof the &+yu&+wnd&+yerbe&+wl&+yly&+g has been ripped out and is gone, but very little else of it&n
&+ghas been touched.  Apparently its neck was broken to kill it as there are few&n
&+gwounds on it, none of which should have been fatal.  But the head lies wrong,&n
&+gat an awkward angle.  The kill is not that old, as few &+Lflies&+g have found it to&n
&+gland on it, so the &+mpredator&+g that killed this &+mpredator&+g may not be far away.&n
