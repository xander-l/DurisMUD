   DISCLAIMER:: This tome has but a few commands and but a few bits of
advice that might help you adventurer! When something is in quotes such as
'look at book', then that is the expected command to be typed and entered.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~PAGE 1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Adventuring can be a lonely buisness in the beginning. Somtimes you may
feel like your alone in your fight. But there are others. 'who' will give
you a list of other adventurers like yourself, that are on your side of the
race war.
   The race war is the war of the Goodie races (human, elves, dwarves and
the like) against the Evil races (Trolls, Orcs, Drow and the like). It is
fought by adventurers like yourselves. Not every Troll or Orc you see will
be an adventurer however. Some are just inhabitants of the game and not
controlled by someone such as you. With experience you will be able to tell
but for now, its not that important.
   Some basic tools are 'look', 'examine', 'who', 'east/west/north/south',
'inventory', 'equipment', 'score' and 'attributes'. If you are unfamiliar
with any of these try them. Now would be a good time.
   'Wear', 'wield', 'get', and 'open' are other essential commands. Most
commands require arguments added to do what you want. Such as 'look at
book' or 'wear cloak' or 'open backpack' or 'get shoes from backpack'.
   'remove cloak' will remove an item you are wearing. 'kill rat' will
kill a rat if there is one in the room. If you have two cloaks in your
inventory and you want to put the second cloak in your backpack, then
something like 'put 2.cloak backpack' will do the trick.
   'READ PAGE2' for a secret.

   Alot of these commands have shortcuts to use them. Backpack can be
shortened to 'bp', east can be shortened to 'e' etc. Sometimes you can set
a shortcut that you want by using your Mud Client. The most common use of
this is for casting. If you are a caster, to cast a spell you have to type
cast 'magic missile' orc. But if you set up in your Mud Client an alias of
'mm' equaling cast 'magic missile', then to cast it at an orc you would
simply type 'mm orc' and your Mud Client would substitute mm with cast
'magic missile'.
   And that is about it for the scope of this book. To actually learn your
class we will take that on with on the game training. You will want to know
this next thing now though. How to communicate.
   You can communicate with anyone on the 'who' list by 'tell name
message' where name and message is substituted by a persons name and your
message. Type 'who' now! Find the 3rd or 4th person down the list and then
type 'tell (that persons name goes here) HI! I'm new.'. Depending on many
things you may get a response back or not. There are a few people with
GUIDE written beside their names and those will be able to help alot as
well.

   Sometimes you will want to group with others. To do so, you must
'consent' the group leader for him to group you. The leader would type
'group (name of person)' to group that person. Once in a group, you have a
new communication option of 'gsay' which is short for group say that only
those that are grouped with you can hear. You can type 'group' by itself
to see who are currently in your group.
   You will also want to follow someone eventually. This is as easy as
typing 'follow (name of person)' you want to follow. 'Con (mob name)' will
give you vague idea if that mob is too much for you to fight and win
against. Some animals like horses can be mounted by 'mount (mob name)'.
   If you walk around you may find you can eventually not move anymore.
This is because you only have a certain number of movement points and once
those are used up, it takes abit of time to regenrate those movement
points. 'skills' will show you the skills you have and what level those
skills are. 'help' and 'help (subject)' will give you alot of help in
game.
