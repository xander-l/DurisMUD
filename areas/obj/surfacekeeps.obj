freshly killed osquip remains~
   &+yThis small, fresh corpse is that of a recently-killed &+Yosquip&N&+y, a race of
&+ysubterranean rats known for their hairless bodies and two massive teeth that sit
&+yprotruding from their open, &+cdrool&N&+y-soaked mouths.
   &+yThis fresh corpse has a fair amount of meat on it, which can be quite tender
&+yand juicy.
