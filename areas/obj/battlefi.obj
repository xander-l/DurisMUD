&+C|&+L     where&+W cities&+L are created or destroyed using &+mma&+Lgi&+Lc, we sought out a      &+C|
&+C|&+L   solitude for our persons to practice and experiment in peace, untouched  &+C |
&+C|&+L    by the &+gpo&+Liso&+Gns&+L of the &+rinfadels&+L and brutes of this &+bworld&+L.  In time we     &+C|
&+C|&+L   found such a place.  How incredibly satisfying it was to create a stable  &+C|
&+C|&+L   environment for which to work from, for it was productive.  These times   &+C|
&+C|&+L   weren't meant to last it seems, as our&+W g&+Lo&+Wd&+Ls turned their backs to us, and &+C|
&+C|&+L   we were forced to fight the collective onslaught of the many whom we had  &+C|

&+C|&+L   on both sides, however, our fate had been sealed, a victory of this kind  &+C|
&+C|&+L   would not bestill my&+b brethren&+L.  It was decided to instead move all that   &+C|
&+C|&+L   we have construed through our &+Mmagic&+L and labor to another desolate region  &+C|
&+C|&+L   of this continent, and when the time was nigh, retake what is ours.  That&+C |

&+LThis helm looks to have seen better days, it's a wonder it's still wearable.
&+LWhy someone would want this to protect the skull is unreal, for it has so
&+Lmany dents it's unreal.  Or perhaps that's just a reason to wear it, perhaps
&+Lthere is some secret power unrevealed.

demon lord statue~
&+LThis statue is of pure granite, and a master piece of art.   There is no doubt
&+Lthat a power from antoher realm created this.  It rises ten feet hight, and is
&+Limmeasurable in width and diameter.  Its most noticible feature is its
&+L&+Rfierery&+L eyes.  Its powerful aura emminates throught the caverns, it seems
&+Lto become something majestic.  There is no question that it beholds some power,
&+Lbut how the power manifests itself is the real riddle.
