&+Land turning, your thoughts turn to a pit of hissing snakes.  Several
&+Ltentacles of solid vapor sprung from the cloud seem to probe their
&+Lsurroundings as if searching for something.  As a tentacle comes
&+Lwrithing in your direction, every fiber of your body screams for you to
&+Lflee, but alas, it is too late.  With lightning speed the tentacle
&+Llashes out, wraps itself around your chest.  You scream in pain and
&+Lterror as a chilling cold spreads throughout your body, numbing you to
&+Lthe core.  You cannot help but to stare into the center of the cloud,
&+Lwondering if it's not somehow alive.  As your thoughts flicker and die,
&+Lthe last thing that accompanies you on your way into oblivion is the
&+Lsound of cold laughter ringing in your ears...&n

staff blackened netheril~
  Shortly before the fall of the great Netherse empire, a powerful, but paranoid
mage was experimenting with a spell to embody his essence within inanimate
objects, so that he might use this ability to spy on his apprentice, which he
wrongfully believed was usurping his work as his own. He decided to attempt this
initial feat on his staff, which was a mundane simple walking staff he used to
hobble about his home. Ironically enough, when he attempted to cast the spell,
this was at the exact moment that the powerful wizard Karsus unleashed his spell
which brought about the doom of the Netherese empire, by bringing all magic to
a halt suddenly, and warping the weave itself by an unknown means. The side
affect of this, for our bumbling wizard, was that his spell not only embodied
his essence within the staff, but also fused his soul with the staff itself.
The mage remained sentient within the staff, even though his cries and screams
could not be heard by the mortal world. After many millenia of this
imprisonment, he began to go mad, and viewed his impromptu immortality as a
blessing, and began malevolently pursuing the search for power yet again. As he
did so, from within his prison of wood, it began to eminate his evil desires,
magically infusing it to transform from a simple walking staff, to one of the
most powerful artifacts in the realm today.

&+Lfeeble fantasies forever dashed. Pleas for mercy met with fatal &+wforlorn
&+Lfury.  Slayed, hacked, mangled, burned at the stake, all this for his
&+Lpleasure.  The ancient one, tormentor of &+Cso&+cul&+Cs &+Llost, lives taken
&+Land tossed.  Time shattered by the sadistic &+Bchill &+Lof death.&N
