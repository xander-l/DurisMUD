:  Deeds were known far and wide ... but yet she was not happy.  The   :
:  Greatest source of her sorrow was that she had no instrument to     :
:  match her matchless voice ... so her lifelong quest was to find a   :
:  maker who could possibly fashion a lute so pure and good that it    :
:  would never break, and one of sound tone and tune that would        :

:  It is said that after traveling far and wide (even farther and      :
:  wider than most bards go) she found a wizard.  The wizard agreed to :
:  make the instrument for her, aided by his arcane arts.  For, of     :
:  course, a price.  Amberyl, without a moment's hesitation, agreed    :
:  and departed for a year without even asking the price.              :
:                                                                      :
:  The mage withdrew for the year to create the lyre, and during that  :
:  year Amberyl roamed the land, longing for the instrument so deeply  :
:  that all known compositions by her that year are melancholy or      :
:  filled with sadness.                                                :

:  The mage smiled sadly.  'What price can one pay to allow such music :
:  in the realm of men?' he asked.  'It does not belong here.  It is   :
:  another world entirely.  One cannot possess such music and remain   :
:  here for long, so close to mortal sorrow and woe.  There is no      :
:  price for this.'  The mage held up a hand before Amberyl could      :
:  reply.  'There is, instead, a limit.  Every time you play the lyre  :
:  You will age ... the more you play the lyre the faster you will age :
:  until the winds of time claim you for their own.  The lute will not :
:  age the player after its first owner has succumed to time's ravages :
:  but the first owner must pay this price.'                           :
