	&+WMathilda, dear sister and master swordsmen.  The voyage from Menden-

	&+WTwo nights ago we stayed on the boat, even though we had already
	&+Wdocked on this realm.  Pelor calls me forth to destroy an undeath
	&+Win this realm, Barovia.  Thendrick feels a similar call to vanquish
	&+Wthe world of a dark plague that is forming.

	&+WMathilda and I were going to venture to the mansion of the
	&+wburgomaster to try and figure out what the disturbance would be,
	&+Wbut after speaking with some patrons at a local bar, the Weary
	&+WHorse Inn, Mathilda decided to join Thendrick to the church.  My
	&+Wbrother in arms has felt a calling to the church.  We have decided
	&+Wthat I will guard the horses and stand watch at the southern gates
	&+Wof Barovia.  Hopefully we will find answers to this looming evil
	&+Wpresence that plagues the hearts of Thendrick and I.  Godspeed
