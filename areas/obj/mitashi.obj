steel hammer warhammer~
Constructed of a heavy, solid wood topped with a steel head, this warhammer
is unwieldy enough to require two hands to use effectively for most.

iron jingasa hat~
This hat resembles the wide, round straw hat used by peasant farmers except
for this one is made of iron instead of straw.  It doesn't have guards
for the ears, cheeks, or neck.  It would provide excellent shade from the
sun, but no real protection to those areas.  Two simple straps made of cord
extend from the side of the hat, where the ears of a wearer would be,
and they can be tied to keep it on one's head.

kimono lotus flower cimson silk komono~
&+r   This kimono has been finely woven and embroidered with the care of a
&+rmaster craftsman, or woman. It has a fine pattern of lotus flowers and
&+rswans, interlocking and juxtaposed along the edges of the garmet. It
&+rseems to have a rather thin braided silk belt, which indicates that this
&+ris a female's garmet. The quality of this garmet seems to imply only a
&+rnoble woman could afford such a luxury.&n

katana sword retribution~
This magical sword is called 'Retribution', and it is one of the seven
great swords of the Jade Empire.  Created by the mad master smith Kunji
Pishida during the chaotic years when the Empire was first formed, the
seven swords were given to the seven Lords who unified the lands, ending
the decades of civil war and infighting between the Clans.

Since that time, the seven swords have been given out to the six leaders
of the most powerful clans, while the seventh and most powerful sword
had been hidden away.  'Retribution' is that seventh weapon.
