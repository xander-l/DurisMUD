adamantine plates by some inventive craftsman.  Due to the reenforced plates
the &+Wribcage&n looks like it could survive a battle with ease, unlike its
past owner.

chainmail blood horde suit~
This &+Yplate&+Wmail&n was first designed to give the &+rBlood &+LHorde&n more maneuverability
and movement so they could hit targets further from their base of operations.
Crafted from light weight &+madamatium&n and enspelled, this armor served the &+rBlood&n
&+LHorde&n as their main defense.  Spikes jut out of the armor to alow for more
damage in hand to hand fighting for the more bloodthirsty.&n
