&+W   The pages yellow with age, and smeared with black dust, some of its&n
&+Wcontent is still somewhat legible...&n

        This is the fourth night of the month of Storms.  This day marks the
     twelvth year since those damned templars cast us here.  They sought
     every corner of the lands for us and found us nonetheless.  Damn Samael,
     my brother the big sellout.  He had always been jealous of me.  I was
     stronger, more beautiful, and more adept in the ways of war than he.
     At least they granted that me and my wife could die together.
     I have three children now, and I have just today explained to them why
     they are here.  Those Templars had gone around seeking for human
     aberrates and throwing them down into their carved throat of steel hooks.
     Little do they know.  Some of us had survived the initial fall, and with
     time had managed to carve out a path from the tunnel westwards.  Thank
     Derran again for his talents, he had denoted that there was a natural
     cavern to the west with his dwarven senses.  I was luckier than he,
     the tunnel was already built when I was cast down the tunnel.  I lay
     there, drenched in blood, waiting to catch my wife with whom I was
     to die.  A sentinel used to lay there, whispering that we move westwards
     and down through the waters.  I wonder if he is still there?  Well,
     Derran is down below with the outcasts now, they are all humans with
     natural handicaps, paralyses, mental defects.  The unpure as you will.
     Most have grown to be great scholars with time, they have learnt how
     to automate wood to complete their daily tasks.  Their youngen are
     crazy though, this confined time wears down on you, my sole comfort
     being that I will one day rise with my kin and slay the altruistic
     bastards above.  They have just yesturday painted a stupid pentagram
     on my front door.  I'll have to wash it off later I guess.  For now,
     my wife wants me to go look for my youngest son, he is late for supper.
     Rumors have it that some undead are romaing about on the plateau.  Bah,
     I'll hunt them later.  My wife has only scryed one in the center
     waterfall anyways.  What's a wet zombie going to do!


&+W...the rest is none more than someone's lost memories now.&n

sword sharpness~
&+c   This giant two-handed sword must be one of the most magnificently crafted
&+cblades in existence.  Legends have it that the gods had forged this blade
&+cthemselves for thousands of years on end.  It was thrown to the earth from
&+cthe heavens above, and  had torn a great fissure across the worlds on its
&+cjourney to these lands.  The legends also say that this blade is so sharp,
&+cwhen properly focused, it could even cut a man's soul in half.  It is made
&+cof an odd white metal, that is harder than most anything one could have
&+cever seen, and it emits a low resonant hum as it is wielded about the air.
&+cIts thick hilt must be close to three feet long, and the blade, itself close
&+cto nine inches wide, but have another six feet in length.  Polished to a
&+cmirror's shine, the whole sword gleams wildly in the sunlight.  The edge of
&+cthe sword is extremely sharp however, and caution is advised.  A series of
&+Ggreen &+gglo&+Gwi&+gng&+c runes are etched across the width of the blade, perhaps four&n
&+cor so inches from the tip of the gargantuan weapon.&n

   This transparent belt is rather cold to the touch, it has a series of

adamantite turn within it.  It has a faint blue aura about it, that surely
reveals its paranormal nature.  It is named after its inventor, the last
thing he made before leaving this world.
