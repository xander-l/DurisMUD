daganar cloak stealth~
The story of Daganar is an old, often told tale.  Daganar was a petty thief
who lacked the skills of the halflings and gnomes of nearby provinces.  The
tall, clumsy human was not the most adept of pickpockets until he stumbled
upon a cloak in the mansion of a wealthy collector.  Daganar was soon known
as the purple streak since he now wore this ugly cloak wherever he went.  Soon,
Daganar's skills in the thieving arts were much more cultivated.  The cloak,
it is believed, allowed the fledgling thief to move without detection and to
disappear at will.  Daganar was unable to sneak off with the treasure of a
sleeping great wyrm, however, when unbeknownst to him, his magical cloak had
become snagged on a sharp rock on the cavern wall and slipped off his back.
The clumsy rogue never stood a chance.  It is unknown what happened to his
cloak after Daganar's demise.
