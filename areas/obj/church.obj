&+W        My Lord,&n
&+W           The mission on which you entrusted me has&n
&+W        met with failure.  I am no closer to learning&n
&+W        the true nature of the church than before I &n
&+W        departed.  However there is another matter I&n
&+W        must discuss with you.  The bearer of this &n
&+W        note was among those whom rescued me, and  &n
&+W        thus is deserving of some manner of reward.&n


&+W                                Your servant always&n
&+W                                Relxis       &n
&+W                                Royal Paladin&n
