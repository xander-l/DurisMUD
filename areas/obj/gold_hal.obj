&+Wthe knuckle area seems about four inches thick, while the palm side is
&+Wmade of only cured leather, to ensure maximum maneuvurability for the
&+Whands, and allows much better grip. These gauntlets were made from pure
&+Wsteel melted with a strange white substance to make the hard metal seem
&+Wbright. Very finely made, and very beautiful these gauntlets are indeed
&+Wlustrous and costly.
