chap1~
        &+rCHAPTER ONE: TUROLOPOLIS

        &+wThis tongue-twister of a town was founded in the year 62 by a
gentleman named Willem of Turol (Turol, of course, being the ancient
order of antipaladins to which Willem belonged). Willem had not yet
reached his thirtieth year, but had already acquired a great deal of
power, both within the order of Turol and in the environs around
Tharnadia. However, he found the growth of his dominion at a standstill
due to Tharnadia's long-standing ban on the slavery of sentient life.
Angered at these impositions, Willem set out to found his own city,
where he could possess people as well as things, and exercise his will
over them.
        Thus, over the relatively short span of eight decades did
Turolopolis grow into an impressively vast city. Indeed it was one of
the marvels of Duris in that its slave population greatly outnumbered
the freemen in the city. Even in the dark ages of long ago, no city
dared such a perilous position. Only the dark magic of Willem prevented
an uprising, and those few revolts that grew from infancy were cut down
by Willem's mighty guard, the Crimson Watch.
~
E
chap2~
                &+WCHAPTER TWO: THE RING OF GLORY

        &+wIt was in the year 141 that the Ring of Glory, an accomplished
and well-respected guild based out of Woodseer, decided to take action
and free the slaves of Turolopolis. The six senior members of the Ring
formed ranks during the dead of the Month of Everfreeze, and set off.
An eyewitness to their arrival says that the fighting between the Ring
and the Crimson Watch was 'fiercer, more ferocious... than anything I
have seen before. Tiamat herself would have wilted beneath such an
onslaught.' The Ring of Glory, led by Kalmidor Spellforge, defeated
over forty Watchmen and provided enough time for over three hundred
slaves to make good their escape. However, in the end they were over-
whelmed and defeated. It is said, although I could not ascertain the
truth of this, that they were not immediately killed, that Willem had
something else in mind for them.
        This incident had two important effects outside of Turolopolis.
First, the Ring of Glory found itself without a vital core. Its six
most vital members had disappeared, and the guild disbanded soon
thereafter, drifting off to other guilds. Secondly, the already-frosty
relations between Turolopolis and Tharnadia degenerated even further,
and an outright war threatened.

chap3~
                &+rCHAPTER THREE: THE HOLOCAUST

        &+wAs Tharnadia was gearing up for a massive invasion of the city of
Turolopolis, the death of thousands was averted... by the death of thou-
sands. The following is a report by Volhar, a merchant who at that time
ran a wagon train from Myranthea to Turolopolis.

        &+c"Well, we was about a dozen leagues from the city gates, when
  ol' Kath pointed to a cloud that was fornimg up over the city. It
  wasn't like no cloud I'd seen before, either- it was a dark red
  color, like blood after it's been sitting awhile, almost black. I
  called to the wagons to halt, and we watched as this bright rain
  started fallin' out of the cloud. Even from that far I could see
  the little buildings go down like they was made of straw. I tell
  you, we were on our way back to Myranthea faster'n an Elf's arrow!
  I dunno what that cloud was, and I hope I never do."

        &+wThe author has conducted an extensive investigation of the
aforementioned cloud and has been unable to determine its origin. The
Board of Nobles in Tharnadia has disavowed any complicity, but one
cannot rule out the possibility that a team of sorcerors created such
a rain of fire and unleashed it on Turolopolis. It seems more likely,
however, that the gods themselves tired of Willem and his atrocities
and put an end to them in a most striking way.

be quite well protected from blows to the head, but it does look quite
unwieldy.

weight, were it not for the powerful enchantments that surround the clay-
more. It remains balanced in the wielder's hands in almost any circumstance
and can even be hurled at an enemy. The blade has a simple straight edge on
one side, and a series of jagged hooks on the other.

The crimson color of the skull is enough to brand this remain as belonging
