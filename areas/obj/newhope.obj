&+y   This set of stocks is big enough and sturdy enough to hold even the largest&n

&+yeven stronger, and consists of three pieces.  This center piece is permanently&n
&+ymounted to the stand that is firmly planted into the ground.  Along the top of&n
&+ythe center piece, six large semi-circles have been carved out at evenly spaced&n
&+yintervals where the necks of those being punished to rest. A small semi-circle&n
&+ywhere a wrist would be placed is on each side of the large semi-circle.  Along&n
&+ythe bottom of this center piece, semi-circles have been carved which match the&n
&+yones for the wrists, only these are for the ankles.  Each section of the stock&n
&+yhas its own individual top and bottom pieces.  Each one has semi-circles which&n
&+yline up with those on the top of the center piece.  When this top piece is set&n
&+yagainst the center piece it keeps the prisoner secure by trapping his head and&n
&+yhis hands without hope of escape.  The bottom piece clamps his ankles in place&n
&+yso that he cannot even defend himself, much less escape.  Those who can see an&n
&+yaura of magic see that this stock is heavily enspelled, ensuring that whatever&n
&+ythe size of the prisoner, the stocks will shrink or grow to fit him. All along&n
&+ythe length of the stock is &+rbl&+Roo&+rd,&+y both &+Rfresh&+y and &+rdried&+y to stains, from all the&n
&+yprisoners that have been slowly carved up by the denizens of the town who like&n

&+y   The vu&+rlt&+yure carved from this piece of pine looks as though it is about to&n
&+yturn its head and attack the holder with its beak.  Its beady black eyes are&n
&+yso dark because of the depth the carver has placed them.  Irregular blotches&n
&+yhave been stained darker than the normal pine color, giving the vu&+rlt&+yure more&n
&+ydepth, and the look of a semi-molting bird.&n

carved wood numchucks~

&+ycarving is not deep, but just enough to afford an extra bit of grip.  A darker&n
&+ycolor outlines the scales as though blood was used to stain the outlines.  The&n
&+ynumc&+rh&+yuc&+rk&+ys have been made by attaching the hard wood to a fine chain which is a&n

&+r   The &+gtroll&+r janitor is never without this &+wmo&+yp,&+r as it is his job to make sure&n
&+rthat no slippery substances - such as blood - are left on the floor where the&n
&+blord&+r of the &+Ldark keep&+r might slip on them.  He takes his job seriously and had&n
&+rthis extra-sturdy &+wmo&+yp&+r made so that it will not wear out soon.  The handle has&n
&+rbeen carved from &+yoak&+r while the mophead is specially woven long &+wcotton strands&n
&+rthat have been attached to the handle in loops.  These strands absorb a great&n
&+rdeal of liquid and greatly aid the &+gtroll&+r in his quest to keep the floors dry.&n

&+rcarved and smoothed &+mdragonscale&+r that has been fitted together in such a way&n
&+rthat there seem to be no seams.  It sits up on a dias of pure black marble,&n
&+rand the steps carved into this block of marble are steep, fit for giants or&n
&+bogres&+r to use rather than smaller people.  The base of this &+mthrone&+r is solid,&n
&+rwith no legs but rather a square block that sits directly upon the dias. It&n
&+rhas a tall back, over the top of which is hung a huge &+mdragon's head,&+r set in&n
&+rsuch a way that the nose is pointing down toward the seat.  The eyes in the&n
&+rhead are set so that they seem to be peering out angrily at whatever stands&n
&+rin this room, and those who have come to &+bHammerhead's&+r court have the uneasy&n
&+rfeeling that this head will be able to see through any lies they might even&n
&+rconsider telling.  The two arms are set solidly on the base, and are shaped&n
&+rto fit &+bHammerhead's&+r arms perfectly.  This &+mthrone&+r was made for the &+blord,&+r and&n

horn parasaurolophus~
&+r   The long top crest of a &+mp&+Marasauro&+ml&+Mo&+mph&+Mus&+r has been taken and cleaned out.  It&n
&+ris naturally hollow and has a wonderful mellow sound when it is used.  Only on&n
&+rthe lower end was any work required, and that was just so that it would not be&n
&+runcomfortable on the mouth when it is being used.  The bone is naturally mauve&n
&+rin color, and polishing has brought out some dark bands on the bone.&n

&+rbut has an intricate carving on the top and a mitral pin attached to the back&n
&+rso that it can be used as a badge.  The carving on the top is a crossed sword&n
&+rand bone, with a raven's head above and a single dark eye below the crossing.&n
&+rPaint has been used to bring out the individual components, creating a unique&n

&+rare outlined in black and have light gray spots on them.  The &+bmas&+Lk&+r is light,&n
&+rso light that the wearer would probably forget they even had it on.  The one&n
&+rlooking at the wearer is easily distracted from the words that the wearer is&n
