longsword massive sword dusk dawn~
&+LA full length of this massive &+clongsword&+L is covered with &+rred&+L and &+bblue&+L veins.
&+LThe whole sword delicately pulsates with &+mstrong &+Menchantment &+mmagic.
&+LIt is believed that in combat it can call upon the powers of night and the sun,
&+Lalthough how much if it is a leged, and how much is truth, is not sure.
