        word and shall keep my part of the bargain.  The Hunters
        are in transit between the orcish caves and Myrabolus, the
        city is not nearly as heavily guarded as usual as most of
        those balance keeping idiots are being distracted once
        again by Maverick.  If you wish to continue ahead with
        your plan against the city of balance you will do so with
        out my assistance, for I have learned, the treasure within
        the city palace is not nearly as amazing as you have
        dreamt it to me.  Too much trouble for too little.  I
        have another plan though.  Why be content with Myrabolus
        when we can have at the major cities on the surface,
        the fortesses and castles all have one major weakness,
        and it is a weakness exploited by the air.

        my plan and hijack it.  The sky will be mine, and you
        can have what you want with Myrabolus and our deal
        will be completed.  If you wish to meet me here I have
        found a portal from the Pits of Cerberus that come
        to Home.  This is where I will be.  I imagine the guards
        of the Home wouldn't appreciate your kind knocking
