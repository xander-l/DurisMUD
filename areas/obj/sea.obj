statue~
     The statue depicts a large ship as it sinks into murky waters. From it
a silvery beam leads to a figure that was the first ancestor of the aquatic
elves. History tells that once a large vessel full of elves was sailing the
seas, seeking a new land, away from the vileness and cruelty that they
saw in their homeland. A powerful storm beset them as they were well into
their voyage. A mighty beam of lightning struck their ship, and split it in
two. As their goddess had planned when she sent them on their perilous
voyage, the elves, though struggling for air, began to drown. As the drowning
elves took water to their lungs, gills formed on their necks. From then on
would they make their home in the sea, free from the persecution of others.

statuette floating~
The statuette floats gracefully, an aura surrounding it that does not allow
anything but the glance of the eye. The image is of a woman's hands, a
glowing ball cupped delicately in them. It seems as though it is almost
beckoning that the orb be taken from it. Coarse blue sleeves fall away from
the hands, and that is where the image ends. Though one can walk completely
around it, the image remains always the same as if there were no other
dimension to it than the one visible.
