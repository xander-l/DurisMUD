history~
&+L   "In ages past, a great wizard know as Llevron Dor grew tired of the
&+Lplaces of men. Taking himself, his servants, and his pets, he sought across
&+Lthe great ocean for a land where he could be alone.  After many days of
&+Lwandering the sea, he found a rich land untouched by the hand of man.  Using
&+Lhis magic, Llevron Dor set about building a haven for himself and his people
&+Ldeep in the wilderness.  And, he remained there for many years, happy.
&+L
&+L   "However, the decendents of the servants he brought with him grew restless
&+Lwith the seclusion.  They wished to travel back to civilization, to mingle
&+Lwith thier own kind.  Slowly, a few at a time, the servants went out, looking
&+Lfor a way to return to the land of men.  One explorer, Celicus, found the
&+Loriginal route that brought them to the wilderness so long ago.  The news of
&+Lpassage home grew fast, and, almost overnight, the servants were all but gone,
&+Lonly a few loyal servants remained behind.  Llevron Dor soon found that the
&+Loperation of his home was too much for his remaining servants, and set about
&+Lto find a solution.  He observed the wolf; cunning, strong, intelligent,
&+Lagile, and most of all, loyal to thier pack.  He thought the wolf would make
&+Lan ideal servant, so began to experiment with wolves, changing thier form,
&+Lincreasing thier intelligence, and lengthening thier lifespan.  His first
&+Lsuccess he named Lionel.  Lionel was a quick learner, eager to please, and
&+Ltruly devoted to Llevron.  And from Lionel, Llevron created an new race of
&+Lbeings.. the Wolfen.
&+L
&+L   "All was well in the beginning, the Wolfen turned to Lionel as thier
&+Lleader, and Lionel turned to Llevron as his god.  They worked hard, trained
&+Lquickly, and soon were running all operations of the haven.  The humans who
&+Lwere former servants, now became supervisors over the wolfen.  And it is in
&+Lthis, that was the downfall of Llevron.  Having been servants so long,
&+Lsuddenly thrust into positions of superiority, and supervising beings that
&+Lthey did not consider to be 'real', they abused thier positions, and thier
&+Lwolfen subordinates.  The wolfen people appealed to Lionel, begging him to do
&+Lsomething.  Lionel approached Llevron with the tales cruelty, but Llevron
&+Lonly nodded, and wanted to get back to his experiments.  This infuriated
&+LLionel.  Slowly, he began to organize the Wolfen, training those who could
&+Lunderstand some of the baser concepts of magic, having those who were best
&+Lsuited as warriors to practice at night with sticks.  Soon, they were ready
&+Lto fight back.  Leading his people, Lionel razed the houses in Haven, easily
&+Lcrushing the few human guards that watched over the town.  People fled to the
&+Lcastle for safety, and the night ended in a stand-off.. a siege.  Llevron,
&+Lbeing a peaceful man, met with Lionel, trying to vie for peace.  The terms
&+Lwere simple: all humans must leave the wilderness in a tenday, or there
&+Lwould be no humans left alive on the continent in a fortnight.  Llevron,
&+Loutraged, refused the terms, and vowed to see every last wolfen dead.
&+L
&+L   "Llevron returned to the palace, and locked himself in his personal tower.
&+LMany days later, he emerged with nine swords.  Eight he cradled in his arms,
&+Lthe last he left hanging from his side.  He gave these swords of power to his
&+Lmost trusted assistants, and instructed them in thier use.  The next day, the
&+Lgreatest battle the land had ever seen broke out.  Powerful magics were
&+Lunleashed, and thousands of wolfen were swept away in mass destruction.  But,
&+Leven with that much raw power, the sheer number of wolfen soon turned the tide
&+Lof the battle.  Llevron Dor was slain as he tried to complete a circle of
&+Lteleportation, his personal bodyguards being ripped to shreds around him.
&+L
&+L   "Life for the Wolfen, after the death of the humans, was good. The found
&+Lnew magic in Llevron Dor's tower, and began to rebuild Haven.  But, Lionel was
&+Lconcerned.  He saw Haven as a symbol of the humans, and the wolfen needed to
&+Lhave something of thier own. So, by royal decree, the Wolfen were commanded to
&+Lleave Haven and build thier own lives outside of its walls.  No wolfen was
&+Lto return within, and all record and memory of its existence was to be
&+Lforgotten.  As the last wolfen left, Lionel cast a mighty spell that rendered
&+Lthe city immaterial and invisible.  And the Wolfen went out to seek thier
&+Lfortune in the world..."

&+Land a last note along the bottom the page:

&+wof the *#*#* with him.  With the destruction of the portal, we have nothing
