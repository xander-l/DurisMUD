page1~
Roused by a surreal scream,
Torn from troubled sleep,
&+rBloodlust&N filled my dreams.
For love lost I weep.
T'was love too true for me to keep.
I &+Lmurdered love&N while lover slept,
Then woke to find her &+Wdead&N; and wept.

&+rCrimson&N guilt upon my face,
And on the sheets once white.
The dream hath caused this vile disgrace,
And ended &+mlove&N that night.
Its wake a tearful &+rbloody&N sight.
Washed away with lovers &+rblood&N,
Last part of me that was good.

Awake I wished to leave,
This &+Lcursed lust&N behind.
But now I just cannot believe,
I could have been so blind.
For true &+mlove&N is so hard to find.
&+mLove&N and&+L guilt&N made me a fool,
Who knew that fate could be so &+rcruel&N.
~
E
page2~
I knelt beside my mortal wife,
And thought my &+rfate&N unjust.
I know now that what took her life,
Was my immortal lust.
Aided by her naive trust.
The only thing worse than the pain,
Is knowing that&+L I&N am to blame.

I &+Mkissed&N her softly and I wept,
For loss of &+mlove&N divine.
I drained her &+rblood&N as I slept,
In dreaming it was&+r wine&N.
Drank the &+mlove&N that once was mine.
I recalled the dream with scorn,
And knew then why the&+r wine&N was warm.

Then rising from the bed,
Made cold by tragedy.
Not just her that now is&+L dead&N,
But also part of me.
The only part beknown to thee.
I knew then that what I had tried,
&+LK&+ri&+Ll&+rl&+Le&+rd&N off all &+Wgoodness&N left inside.
~
E
page3~
&NMy deeds shall neither save nor &+Ldamn&N,
So I'll have peace and kill.
No matter how much &+rblood&N i spill,
My lovers &+Ldeath &Nhas damned my &+Wsoul&N.
Now all their lives to make mine whole.
