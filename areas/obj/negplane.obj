It essentially makes cobra venom seem like fruit juice, black death taste
like some condiment youd spread on your toast, and tiamats poison be equivelent

victim, for as long as a full hour from the slightest touch.  Fortunately it
is extremely scarce, and mortal assassins have only gotten their hands on the
wicked stuff 2 or 3 times in all history.
And luckily for you, this appears to be a magical vial containing

Sanguine Blessing was created by the ancient smiths of Waturdeep, far before
the cataclysm, and the great war of the Gods.  As the planes were torn
assunder, Sanguine Blessing eventually found its way into the hands of a young
assassin by the name of Zylerian, who one day grew to be the greatest assassin
the world had ever known.  Some experts have speculated that the blade itself
was somehow responsible to Zylerian's sucess in the face of amazingly impossible
odds, but said experts are no longer among the living, as Zylerian never lets
anyone doubt his skill and live.

Similar in effect to boots of elvenkind, boots of stealth are an extremely

The boots work differently than boots of elvenkind however.  Boots of elvenkind
magically do not make sound, while boots of stealth give the user some general
heightened dexterity, along with a keen understand of stealth.

It is said that this type of boot are particularly valued by the more adept
members of the Order of Dire Stalkers.  Also, boots of stealth are valued by
many because due to their other unique enchantment -- one size fits all.
