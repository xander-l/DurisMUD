This fine weapon has been treated with some sort of purple-black dye to keep it
from reflecting light in the darkness.  It is clearly the sort of weapon that
one carries when they wish to remain unnoticed in the darkness and is often
used by the jungle scouts of Woodseer as well as for other darker purposes.

orchid flower star~
This beautiful flower is quite rare, and would be valuable if there was anyway
to keep it alive.  It is one of the many epiphytic flowers of the jungle,
surviving off the nutrients of other plants.  It sinks its narrow roots through
the bark of trees and drains nutrients from them to feed itself.  The long,
thin petals extend outward from the center making it look much like a star.

and sealed the sides together at both the level of the skin and the scales on
the outside of the skin to insure that there are no weak points in the armor.
The pale, iridescent feathers that lined the couatl's wings have been used to
decorate the armor as well.

The knobby end of this huge thigh bone has several sharpened ridges to make it
a more powerful weapon.  Despite its size, it is relatively light and easy to
wield.  Layers of some sort of polish add to its white sheen, making it stand
out in the darkness of the jungle.

carefully detailed.  Artistic sanding as also created slightly different
textures to give the tiger 'stripes' of a sort without resorting to paint or
different inlays of wood.

when it is tapped softly.  A thin head of razor-sharp stone and carefully
carved tail end show that it is meant to be thrown rather than used in one-on-

the dragon's hands is a large, twisted staff with a crystal of some sort at its
head.

encompass the staff and make it disappear, only to fade back into view a few
moments later.  Strange runes and inscriptions have been made all along the
length of the staff but they are completely uninterpretable, as if they were
written in a language never known or spoken in the vast world of Duris.
