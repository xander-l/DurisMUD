&+W  Broken and battered this warrior lies in a heap missing both of his &+rlegs&+W.&N
&+WWhere legs once were, scorched, acid burned stumps now lie.  Although he is&N
&+Wa sight of pity, his eyes still seem defiant.  He looks at you with newfound&N
&+Whope.  In his hand his grip tightens around a &+Ymedallion&+W which he obviously&N
&+Wholds dear.  Looking off to the east his eyes have a faraway look in them.&N
&+WOn his broken breastplate a sigil of Tharnadia.  It is obvious that the
&+Wman needs &+Yassistance&+W.&N

&+Lwhen invaders or outside come to their plane they must be dealt with.  Any&N
&+Lthat survive are forced here where the imp's keep the prison loosely working.&N
&+LNone of the demon's would have the patience for such organization, but the&N
&+Limps provide that service to avoid further torture.&N

&+r  Having been captured during interplanar travel, this demon now runs this&N

&+ramount of that, even though he wishes no contact with others.&N

&+WU&+Lz&+W stands &+Lhere &+Wdeep &+Lin &+Wthought &+Labout &+Wbeing &+Ltrapped.&N
~
&+L  Having been drawn here inexplicably, Uz is not happy one bit.  She is a&N
&+Wgoddess and has better things to do than be trapped in a layer of the abyss.&N
&+WHer skin glows strangely and as she walks about she leaves light trails.&N
&+LShe is encased in an odd globe of energy.  Her brow furrows with frustration as&N
&+Lanother demon snaps at a follower of Lokpan walking by.  Her black and white&N
&+Wrobe decorates her in a very tight form fitting way.  Voluptuous, she would&N
&+Wbe quite a mortal delight if not for her notorious temper.  She looks up
&+Lat any who enter and tries to deem whether they can be useful to her in her
&+cquest&+L to leave, or not.&N

&+Mthe pink elephant carrying luggage&N~
&+MLooking a bit confused, this pink elephant has his bags packed.&N
~
&+M  This pink elephant appears to have been randomly summoned here from another&N
&+Mdimension.  Although Zooox and his followers have a tendency to do such things&N
&+Mto unwitting creatures, it's not clear how this elephant would take such&N
&+Mand explanation.  He had obviously packed a trunk, and was ready to go&N
&+Mtraveling, so he's rather upset.&N

&+M  A clone of the might Zooox, this being is a bit of a weaker copy.  Although&N
&+Mthe original Zooox is still trapped and reduced in power in Mount Banishment,&N
&+Mthis clone lives on in his spirit.  He created a machine downstairs which has&N
&+Mbeen truly irritating to not only the denizens of the abyss, but to all the&N
&+Massorted beings who were unlucky enough to be sucked into portals.  His eyes&N
&+Mseem glazed over, and one wonders if there is any true life behind those eyes,&N
&+Mor if he is but a puppet himself.&N

&+L&+GJ&+gu&+Wb&+ri&+Wl&+ge&+gx&+L in the midst of the &+Rblood war&+L.  None of it seems to make sense, and&N
&+Lthe pit-fiend must be reporting back to somebody on this.  Such creatures are&N

&+L  This hezrou is here following his prince's orders.  While most demons are&N
&+Lnot orderly, they do have a measure of respect for force.  Jubilex is very&N
&+Lgood at using that to get his minions to do as he wishes.  It is a well known&N
&+Lfact that to upset Jubilex, is to be digested by him for a thousand years at&N
&+Lhis leisure.  Very few of these hezrou would ever risk such a fate by&N
&+Ldisappointing him.&N

lolth spider demon queen~
&+man a&+Mc&+mo&+Ml&+my&+Mt&+me of the Spider &+rDemon &+mQueen, L&+Mo&+ml&+Mt&+mh&n~
&+mL&+Mo&+ml&+Mt&+mh&+L, the enormous &+mSpider &+rDemon&+L Queen looks irritated that she must speak to &+GJ&+gu&+Wb&+ri&+Wl&+ge&+Gx&+L.&n
~
&+m  Standing here is Lolth the Demon Queen.  Her many legs move independently with deadly strokes as they move across the ground.  Two human arms wield blades as her beautiful head sits atop a fully spider body.  Her enormous size is impressive, but the red of her eyes as they peer at you is even more so. It is easy to understand how the Drow can be so afeared and enamoured of the demoness all at once.  &N

&+rGr&+Laz'&+rzt&+L, the &nD&+Lar&Nk&+L Prince~
&+rG&+Lr&+baz'&+rz&+Lt, the &ND&+Lar&Nk&+L Prince is here disgusted at having to speak to &+GJ&+gu&+Wb&+ri&+Wl&+ge&+gx&+L.&N
~
&+r  Graz'zt has been dropped here preening as usual.  The difference however&N
&+Lis that it looks as though he is taking out his revenge for having been&N
&+Ldisturbed on anybody that he can get a hold of.  His dark eyes pierce the&N
&+Lcorners of the room and his handsome face is distorted by small horns&N
&+Lwhich still peak out from behind his frock of blond hair.  A dark look&N
&+rcrosses his face as he contemplates what to destroy next here.&N

~
&+m  A horde of driders is here hungering for blood.  They follow their goddess Lolth&n
&+Linto and out of the planes of existence.  They have been recognized as elite among&N
&+Ltheir kind and were provided the honor of escorting their queen.  Many of their &N
&+Lbretheren died in the tournament just to be considered for this position by the &n
&+mspider queen, and none will allow that charge to be harmed.&n

pair dangerous lamias lamia~
&+La &+ypair&+L of dangerous &+rLa&+Rmi&+ras&n~
&+LSerenely looking for a mortal to devour, these &+rLa&+Rmi&+ras&+L serve their master.&n
~
&+r  These Lamias bare their fangs but keep in check at the Dark Prince's command.&N
&+rThey are constantly at his back and call.  To mere mortals their charms are
&+Rnumerous and fangs sink into mortal necks willingly and easily.  For the Dark&n
&+RPrince however, they are his playthings who worship the ground he inhabits and&n
&+Rdo his bidding.  These in particular won the right to his service by destroying&n
&+rmany of his enemies and by showing extreme loyalty.  How that loyalty was displayed&n
&+ris up for speculation.&n
