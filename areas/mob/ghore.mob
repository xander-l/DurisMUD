acquired and needs to sell.

battle as some of his counterparts, but on the other hand, he doesn't seem like
much of a fighter either.  His life has been one of making people happy, and
fighting just doesn't seem like something he would enjoy.

~
Having dispatched the former chieftain some 700 years ago, the Bloodeye bloodline
has been in control of the Swamp Troll nation ever since.  Each of the reigning
Trolls has been a born leader and an extraordinary physical specimen.  It is
widely rumored that the Bloodeye clan has intermingled blood with another race
leaving them with powers beyond normal Trolls.  Rumors such as this are likely
to the gossip killed, or branded as an outsider, however.  The current chieftain
has a nasty disposition and has been known to outright kill visitors to his
throne upon a bad day.  His size and overall looks are very typical for a Troll,
except for a strange aura of crimson that encircles his eyes.

this troll is the one to see; at least in this town.  His eyes speak of a grave
life, but he grunts and smiles at each new student that comes to see him.
Akol emanates an aura of respect. You know it is best to listen and learn.
