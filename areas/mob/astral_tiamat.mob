juiblex demon prince~
Juiblex~
Juiblex, the Faceless Lord, Prince of Demons, is traveling here in astral form.
~
There is no question that this is the most disgusting and loathsome of all
demons.  Juiblex is foul and nausiating in the extreme.  His dripping form
can lash forward in melee to cause terrible dammage.  He has no set form, but
usually take the form of a cone-like heap, striated in disgusting blackish
greens, foul browns and yellows, and sticky translucent grays and ambers.
From this mass protrude several glaring red eyes.
