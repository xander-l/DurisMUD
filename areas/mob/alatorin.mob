&+Ldeep, paled eyes can be seen scanning the channeling area, he
&+Ldiligently guards the small gateway.  Dressed in a long billowing
&+Lblack robe and immersed in shadow, Od&+re&+Lth spends his endless

&+LMes&N&+yha&Ndan &+Lthe &+Crecruiter &+Lstands here, speaking to his &N&+rlegion.
~
   &+LMeshadan is a half-breed shield/mountain dwarf.  His mother was of the
&+Lpurest blood &+Yshield dwarf &+Lnobility, born under a family that had seen
&+Lthe fourth most kings (6) in the underlying kingdoms through the centuries.
&+LNevertheless, the seed that grew into Meshadan was that of a renegade duergar
&+Lnamed &N&+rGraddakk&+L.  They loved each other on a bountiful night in their
&+Lyouth and so began the legacy of Meshadan.  The half-breed first started his
&+Ladventurer as a wealth-hungry miner, tapping the lands of all the precious
&+Lmetals they could squeeze out.  After years of familiarizing himself with
&+Lthe terrain, he became very good at outwitting his opponents in such familiar
&+Lgrounds.  Meshadan was also a very convincing speaker and seemed to grab
&+Lthe instant appeal of both dwarven bloodlines.  It was not long until he
&+Ldeveloped a great following which then manifested into a small army.  Taark
&+LShanat took notice of Meshadan's influence in a dwarven card game known as
&+L'Ta Druen' when Taark, already at an old age at the time, challenged Meshadan
&+Lto a duel.  Meshadan's men actually outnumbered the humbled guards who threw
&+Ldown their steins and exited the tavern.  Today, however, Meshadan serves
&+Lfor Taark Shanat.

&+mLaduguer appears as a tall, gaunt duergar with a thick mithril statue
&+mteture.  He is bald and frowning in an aura of evil, glooming, and
&+munforgiving.  He is supremely &+Ylawful &N&+mabove all else, but despises
&n&+mthe other dwarven deities for being lazy, indolent, and feckless.
&+mThis statue sits as a symbol to some of the harshest and most secluded,
&+mevil blood enemies of the shield dwarves, stored in this deep below.

&+La great dwarven halberd, keeping everyone away from the beasts within this prison

&+ronly as lore, his &+Lblack duergarish skin&N&+r and &+Ybright
&+Yblonde beard&n&+r that any &+YKimordril dwarf&N&+r would tip his stein
