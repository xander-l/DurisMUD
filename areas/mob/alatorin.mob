&+Ldeep, paled eyes can be seen scanning the channeling area, he
&+Ldiligently guards the small gateway.  Dressed in a long billowing
&+Lblack robe and immersed in shadow, Od&+re&+Lth spends his endless
&+Llife guarding this ancient dark secret of the Alatorin mystic ward.

&+ma mithril statue of Laduguer&N~
&+mA huge golem-sized mithril statue of the duergar god Laduguer stands here, arms crossed.
~
   &+mThis massive statue is that of Laduguer, the great duergar dwarven god
&+mof strict and unforgiving evil judgment.  Although this seems to simply
&+mbe a mithril idol of the duergar god, it certainly is an imposing figure.
&+mLaduguer appears as a tall, gaunt duergar with a thick mithril statue
&+mteture.  He is bald and frowning in an aura of evil, glooming, and
&+munforgiving.  He is supremely &+Ylawful &+mabove all else, but despises
&+mthe other dwarven deities for being lazy, indolent, and feckless.
&+mThis statue sits as a symbol to some of the harshest and most secluded,
&+mevil blood enemies of the shield dwarves, stored in this deep below.

~
   &+mThis ancient &+Mmithril &+Mgolem &+mstands in the shape of an
&+ma dwarven king - only much much larger.  A long forked beard of
&+Mmithril &+mhangs below its stoic face, cascading onto a huge
&+mbreastplate.  Large shoulder guards eclipse the horned helmet
&+mof this royal warrior.  This golem wields no weapons, but has
&+mhuge, mighty arms.  It stands motionless before the center &+Bdias&+m.

&+WA hooded half-breed named &+LM&Nar&+Wg &+LD&+Y'&+Lg&Nh&+Wor floats here on a cloud of &+Lblack smoke&+W.
~
   &+WMarg D'ghor, revered amongst the troglodyte white-faced tribe
&+Was the all-knowing father, is a unique and powerful figure.
&+WAlthough his body posesses the traits of the neighboring trogs,
&+Whis posture and intellect suggest that his lifestyle is much
&+Wmore then the primitive ritualistic ways of his kin.  Marg D'ghor
&+Wwears a long, hooded white robe, for instance.  Clothing of any
&+Wtype is extremely uncharacteristic for his race.  He is also
&+Wseen grasping a staff used for invokation, rather then as a blunt
&+Wweapon like his kin may do.  It is no wonder that Marg D'ghor is
&+Wreverred with such 'graces' among the other troglodytes, as he
&+Wclearly has an otherwordly intellect and presence.

muscular trog troglodyte blood monger bloodmonger~
&+ya muscular t&+Gr&+yo&+Gg&+yl&+Go&+yd&+Gy&+yt&+Ge &+rblood&+Rmonger&N~
&+yA muscular t&+Gr&+yo&+Gg&+yl&+Go&+yd&+Gy&+yt&+Ge &+rblood&+Rmonger &+yseeks the thrill of his next &+rkill&+y.
~
   &+yThis tough, muscle-bound troglodyte has random blood
&+ysplattered dried onto his greenish-brown hide.  Perhaps
&+yblood from the dwarves inhabiting the civilized portions
&+yof these mountains, it is also likely that much of it is
&+yfrom his own race as well.  A keen look of hatred and
&+ybloodlust fills the eyes of this supremely-violent trog.

small young trog~
&+ga small t&+Gr&+go&+Gg&N~
&+gA small, youthful t&+Gr&+go&+Gg &+gcautiously prowls here&+L, wary of his elders.
~
   &+gThis young troglodyte wanders through the tunnels with
&+ga strong caution about everything surrounding him.  It is
&+gnot uncommon for the troglodyte elders to get particularly
&+gabusive towards the young living in the tunnels, and this
&+gimmature troglodyte appears to have been taught one or two
&+glessons.

~
   &+WThis massive white troglodyte is of greatly abnormal size.
&+WIt has pale-white skin and huge red eyes to match its monstrous
&+Wbody.  At least two times bigger than a normal common troglodyte,
&+Wthis beast towers over its cousins in comparison.  It stands with
&+Wa large hunchback, leaning over to duck under the lower parts of
&+Wof the tunnel ceilings as well as sharp stalagmites.

~
   &+yThis muscular, mature troglodyte has several wounds across
&+yits strong body which it currently favors while moving about
&+ywithin these tunnels beneath Shanatar.  It is armored slightly
&+ymore then the frequently-naked trogs, wearing bits of leather
&+yarmor; occasionally seen with straps of metal strapped about.

borik mountain dwarf~
&+YBorik&N~
&nAn incapacitated mountain dwarf named &+YBorik &Nlays here, favoring a &+rwound&N.
~
   &+YBorik, a mountain dwarf native to the realm of &+WWinterhaven&+Y,
&+Ywas one of a few &Nnon-sh&+Wie&Nld &+Ydwarves employed by the &+cAlatorin
&+Ymilitary.  Having come to &+cAlatorin&+Y at a very young age, he
&+Ygraduated from the &+WHammer&+Yhelm academy and went on to train
&+Ywith the Royal &+CBright&+cAxe &+Yguard.  It was in the presence of
&+Ythe king that he would rise to great prosperity, being the
&+Yonly dwarf of &Nnon-sh&+Wie&Nld&+Y dwarven blood to serve in the royal
&+Yguard.  Now, however, he has been captured by the &+ytr&+Yo&+yg&+Ylo&+yd&+Yyt&+yes
&+Yand currently lays within a prison cave stripped of his weapons
&+Yand armor; wearing only stains of &+rblood&+Y and the &+yfilth&+Y around
&+Yhim.

&+LLurking in the shadows, a &+rs&+Lte&+ra&+Llt&+rh&+Ly sh&Nie&+Lld &+mdwarf &+Lrogue creeps through here.
~
   &+LThis shield dwarf is dressed in all black, moving about
&+Lthese tunnels undetected with great stealth.  He appears to
&+Lbe very confident in his movements; maneuvering with a
&+Lplanned precision.  His face is concealed by a tight black
&+Lmask from which he pears out of a thin slit in the material.
&+LHe is very agile and able, and does not really seem like one
&+Lfor conversation.  Perhaps his motives surround riches and
&+Lfortune, or perhaps just his carnal instincts for blood.

&+gA tall, &+ybrawny &+gt&+yr&+go&+yg&+gl&+yo&+gd&+yy&+gt&+ye &+gsentinel stands here, eyeing any who approach the staircase.
~
&+y   This large, slimy green troglodyte is well-muscled and is
&+yan obvious choice for his position - guard of the bone stair-
&+ycase.  He has a devious look in his black eyes, and carries a
&+ybone spear in his scaly claws.

~
   &+gThis massive troglodyte stands easily three-times the size
&+gof his subordinates.  His right arm is extraordinarily muscu-
&+glar and his head bares two massive horns - the most identify-
&+gable mutations of this troglodyte.  Whether he is cursed, de-
&+gformed by a strange magic, or naturally this way is a mystery
&+gand a common source of argument amongst his people and those
&+gadventurers unfortunate enough to cross paths with him.
&+gKereghaktis is utterly covered in slabs of muscle; many of
&+gwhich have been deeply scarred from years and years of battle
&+gand combat.  He has huge yellow and green teeth and awfully-
&+grank halitosis.

~
   &+mMargon Gortat'Nyk, &+Lwhose last name literally translates to
&+L'Big Horn' &+Lis an utterly massive mino&+rtaur&+L, known for his
&+Lcarefree lust for the rare troglodyte females, which are nearly
&+Lhalf his size.  &+mMargon Gortat'Nyk &+Lhas a long black beard
&+Lthat sits upon his massive, furry black chest.  His huge, shiny
&+Lblack horns jut out and upward just a bit, ending in polished
&+Lsharp tips.  &+mMargon Gortat'Nyk's &+Labormal size for a mino&+rtaur
&+Lhave caused him to be feared and loathed by his own people.  He
&+Lstill seems to enjoy the finer things in life, regardless of what
&+Lvile creatures he might enjoy them with.

   &+WBasillion is rather tall for a drow elf, standing nearly six
&+Wfeet in height.  He has a lean, yet muscular build.  At least a
&+Wfew hundred years old, the background behind this drow is quite
&+Wa mystery, as he is not known for any affiliation with any of
&+Wthe houses of Arachdrathos, nor does he wear any of their colors.

   &+rThis cockatrice, native to the Shanatar mountains, has been
&+rcaptured by the troglodytes and chained to a boulder in the

&+rthis vicious mountain bird is still just as deadly as it would
&+rbe in flight.

&+gin constant rotation amongst the troglodytes.
