&+ga halfling scout&N~
&+gA halfling scout patrols the jungle watching for signs of attack.&N
~
This sturdy halfling watches the jungle carefully.  His job is to watch
everything that is happening in the jungle so that Woodseer can be warned well
in advance of any sort of attack by the more violent denizens of the jungle.
He wears well-worn armor and carries a small crossbow as well as a short
sword.

~
Her eyes are bright and cheerful as she surveys her surroundings.  Rather than
notice the damp, humid air or the stench of decay that stains the air, she
focuses on the beautiful epiphytic orchids and bromeliards and other even
stranger flowers in the jungle.  Despite her apparent obliviousness to her
threatening surroundings one gets the impression that she is quite able to
protect herself.

The worried look in his face seems to extend to every line in his body.  He
clearly has none of the necessary skills to survive in the deep jungle and
will likely die quite soon if nobody helps him.  His dark brown eyes appear to
plead for help, and he can be heard mumbling prayers to several different gods
as he attempts to find a way out of the jungle.

High pitched bird-like laughter fills the air as this ridiculous drunkard

in the jungle, few creatures bother to eat bullywugs poisonous flesh so most of
the jungle creatures will only attack them if they are attacked first.

Several long scars run down his once handsome face and a black leather

from Woodseer but he hasn't stopped working, or planning for the day when he
will overthrow Ctenmir and become master of all the halfling thieves.

&+yA large jungle squirrel chitters about.&N
~
This large squirrel is almost identical to all other squirrels with the
exception that it is a bit larger and seems to move more quickly.  There are
dark spots along its brown skin that look almost green rather than black,
setting it apart from most other squirrels in the world.

&+bA large azurian eats bark as it marches across the jungle floor.&N
~
This massive creature has a deep-blue hide that blends in well with the
strange darkness of the jungle.  It appears to be an odd combination of the
body of a buffalo, and sturdy legs of a lion.  It has large clawed paws to
defend itself with, but its large flat teeth show that it is anything but a
carnivore.  It strips bark and even some of the epiphytic flowers off the
jungle trees and eats them, as well as any insects that might be within.

This small cat has delicate features and small claws.  It is only able to hunt
the smaller animals of the jungle, such as frogs, salamanders and insects, but
has been named as a sign of luck, both good and bad.  Its dark fur and red
eyes give it a sinister appearance, but its delicate features and small size
make it difficult to fear.

speed.  It is dangerous due to the strange whip-like appendages it has
immediately over its eyes.  These strange organs bear a poison that has been
known to paralyze even the largest animals.

birds that will feed on almost any other animal in the canopy, especially
monkeys.

perfected for their tasks as this one.  Massive talons and a long, sharp beak
are its weapons and darkness is its ally.  Massive brown eyes allow it to see
in the vague light of the night-time sky and its dark body allows it to fly
through the night like a ghost, snatching up any monkeys or lizards that are
to far out in the open.

jungle predator has been able to develop an immunity.  Just a touch of its skin
can kill even an ogre in seconds.  Brave hunters sometimes try to collect these
creatures to use its poison, the poison doesn't last long when separated from
the frog so it is generally left alone.

keen senses allow it to detect even the smallest movements in the water and
it is willing to attack even the largest creatures in the jungle.

black piranha fish~
&+La black piranha&N~
&+LA black piranha moves through the water eating fallen fruit.&N
~
This large fish is closely related to the dreaded red piranha, at least in
terms of shape.  However, it uses its powerful jaws to crush fruit that falls
into the river instead of to tear flesh from helpless victims.  If angered,
those same jaws can be put to its defense, but this is generally a harmless
fish, though fairly good to eat.

This small alligator has earned a reputation as one of the fiercest predators
in the jungle.  Its short legs are extremely powerful, able to drive it at
incredible speeds.  Fortunately, it also seems to enjoy spending time basking
in the sun.  Long red stripes run down the length of its body, distinguishing
it from its somewhat larger cousins.

propel it through the water at astounding speeds.  This creature may not be the
most fearsome in the jungle, but it is certainly one of the largest and most
dangerous floating in the rivers.

Reiwiggy is a small bullywug, not much bigger than a halfling really, but he
is extremely stout.  His widely spaced, bulbous eyes seem never to blink as
he works on his creations.  It is quite clear that he doesn't like dealing
with any non-bullywugs, though one would suppose it couldn't hurt to ask.
His skin is a mottled brown and green like the majority of bullywugs, and his
hands have been stained purple somehow by the different treatments he uses on
his hides.

This squat bullywug has broad shoulders and muscular arms, but really
doesn't seem as imposing as a number of the guards.  The major difference
is the intelligence that can be seen in his eyes.  His eyes are clear and
piercing, analyzing everything around him.  This bullywug is clearly one
that will think before acting, and will probably negotiate rather than start a
war.

be almost as tall as a human if he stood up straight, instead he stands
hunched in on himself, doing his best to remain smaller than his chief and
to stay out of his way.

somewhat in between.  It may be that their sexual characteristics become more

moisture.  Dark eyes swivel in their sockets as the young adult begins to

bullywug uiiggie~
&+CUiiggie&N~
&+CUiiggie sells his fish to anyone willing to buy.&N
~
Uiiggie is one of the more civilized bullywugs, he wears fine clothing and
does his best to deal with anyone that enters his shop.  A sneer crosses his
frog-like face every time he has to deal with a non-bullywug, but remains
polite and civil, and more than willing to make a deal.  His mottled green
and gray skin is kept damp by a wet cloth shirt that he keeps damp through
constant additions of water with a skin hanging at his side.

&+gA hunched bully&+Lwug&+g shaman concentrates on his work.&N
~
This shaman is the most senior and respected shaman in the entire village.
Even the chief makes certain he doesn't anger him.  He stands hunched over,
little bigger than a halfling, and murmurs his spells in an almost inaudible
chant.  Large gray blotches show where his skin has become over-dried, but he
seems to ignore them, unworried about his appearance.  Bullywug villagers are
in awe of him, not only because of his power, but also of his ability to deal
evenly and fairly with everyone he meets.

This young bullywug has been taken in by the village shaman to be taught all

every bow it receives from other villagers.  Long brown patches cover its dark
green skin from the shoulders all the way down its back.

the moisture in the air.  His pale blue eyes have a hint of malice in them,
a faint suggestion that he is trying to start a fight.

doesn't look as though she has ever seen any violence.  Her drunken stupor
has prevented her from noticing the dangerous, leering glances she has begun
to receive.

that has enough money to buy a drink.

fellow tribesman as they greet him.  Easily as tall as a barbarian, his muscles
aren't quite the same as the other lizardman, perhaps because he spends most of
his time painting in the caves rather than hunting or fishing for food.

Agile fingers skillfully cut and stitch pieces of thick hide together to make
different pieces of armor.  His size would make one think such intricate work
would be difficult, but he is completely at ease with his skins and all the
different compounds he treats them with.

Broad shoulders and a heavy build show that this lizardman would be quite a foe
even without his magical spells.  Dark, deep-blue eyes focus intently on his
work, blocking out all other interactions.  He works away on potions and
elixirs to help his tribesmen in their battles.  Lizardmen come to him when
they are sick or injured almost as often as they go to the tribal priests.
They always come to him when they need potions though, often bearing fine
gifts.

of his way, she gently steps around the many vials and jars filled with a
number of mysterious items.

massive body, and its head is framed by long, thin crystal spikes.  The crystal
of its body armor doesn't appear to be true crystal though, it is some strange
stuff that is tougher than the hardest metal, and yet somehow seems flexible
and light.  The creature moves with an astounding agility and speed for
something of its size.

its defense, and happily repairing and supplying weapons and armor.  Rumor has
it that he lives here for the opportunity to work with different metals and
substances, even dragon scale and other strange substances.  His age is written
in deep soot-filled wrinkles on his face, it may be true that he is only here
seeking a challenge to his great skill at the forge.

in even his long lifetime.  He is slightly taller and more muscular than his
grey elf cousins, but otherwise it would be impossible to tell the difference.
