humanoid ghostly ethereal swimmer ghost~
&+Ban ethereal swimmer&n~
&+BA ghostly humanoid, barely visible, swims through the ether.&n
~
&n   Approximately nine feet in height and vaguely human in appearance, this
ethereal swimmer moves about the plane like a fish through water.  This
being is covered in a thin, translucent skin and the swimmer's internal
organs are plainly visible underneath.  It looks aquatic in nature, with
webbed hands and feet and fins protruding from its back.  It has no eyes
that you can see, no teeth or tongue in its mouth, and doesn't seem to
acknowledge the presense of any non-ethereal creatures.

~
   A mutated combination of ogre and demon, this unnatural beast roams the
ethereal plains, looking like some horrible nightmare that's come to life.
Burning red eyes, hot with rage and battle lust, peer out over the barren
landscape of the Ethereal Plane.

&+GAshahel&n~
&+GAshahel&+L, the cursed guardian, &+Gstands at attention here.&n
~
   This man that stands before you was once a proud &+Ggith&+Wyanki&n warrior, one of
the best of the servants of &+GGith&n.  As his powers increased, so did his
vanity, and soon he believed himself strong enough to overthrow the &+GQueen&n
of the &+GGith&+Wyanki&n people.  The legends of the &+Ggith&+Wyanki&n people say that he
signed an unholy pact with &+RAramus&n, the &+rD&+yr&+ge&+wa&+cm&+re&+ya&+gt&+we&+cr&n, Lord of the &+BEthereal&n
&+BPlane&n.  &+GAshahel&n never intended to keep his side of the bargain, seeking
to trick the immortal Lord of &+rD&+yr&+ge&+wa&+cm&+rs&n... but &+RAramus&n learned of these plans
and destroyed the spirit of the mighty warrior, cursing him to live in the
eerie &+Bworld of dreams&n forever.

Looking like an odd combination of man and platypus, this thought-eater
roams the mists of the ethereal plane.  His odd form obviously makes it
easier for him to travel in the ocean of multi-colored fog.  He searches
the area for prey such as the ethereal swimmers or other natives to the
ethereal plane.

~
About the same height and build as a normal human boy of ten or so, this
bladeling is a warped creation of the ether.  Stringy, solid bunches of
muscle are covered with a sickly grey skin.  No eyes, nose, or mouth is
present on its face, nor does the creature have any hair on its body.
Sharp blade-like spines cover its body, giving the nightmarish creature
its name.

Potent killers because of their high intelligence, ravager assassins

indicating ownership.  Ravagers are mean-spirited beasts, standing
anywhere from 4 to 8 feet in height, a thick collection of muscle and
teeth with thought of only war and destruction.

expression as he grips his halberd tightly and moves to attack.

at the wind as it blows playfully and carefree through the garden.  He
glances over at you, and for a millisecond, a feeling of &+Lsheer horror&n passes
through you.  Odd.  It is only a squirrel after all.

Splashing in the bubbling stream is a small duckling, probably only a few
weeks old.  Occassionally he lets out a loud quack at the little waterbugs
that swim across the surface of the water.  At other times, he dives into
the water chasing the bright, silvery minnows that populate the stream.
Every once in a while, he looks directly into your eyes, staring straight
into the depths of your soul and bringing your worst nightmares to the
surface... then he's back to quacking happily at the bugs and fish and you
stand wondering what the heck just happened.

how to get home, her angelic face has become wet with tears.  She looks up
when you enter, a bright ray of hope dawning on her face, her smile seeming
to light up the already pleasant forest.  Apparently you aren't what she was
hoping for, because she looks back down at the ground and starts to softly
cry again.

is now only an ugly bump.  He stomps around in a small circular path as he
rants, doing small loops but never leaving the colored stone circle.

pair of gold-rimmed spectacles are balanced precariously on his nose.
It's amazing they haven't fallen off yet, as he occassionlly whips his
head around at a new victim to shout at.

Horribly disfigured and mutated, this twisted hulk is covered with patches
of burnt hair, sickly pink skin, and bony spikes that jut out like
razor-sharp spines.  Fiendish red eyes glow in malicious hatred of all
living things, and the beasts fangs drip with a poisonous salivy.

&+cof a true Neogi. The creature itself appears as a cross between a wolf&N
&+cspider and a moray eel. The short, furry eight limbed body is topped by&N
&+ca lithe, bare, fleshy neck with a serpentine head, its mouth filled&N
&+cwith needle-sharp teeth. The ends of its limbs are tipped with small&N
&+cclaws. The fur of the neogi is a light tan, but dyed a variety of&N
&+ccolors to signify power, rank, accomplishments, and warnings to other&N
&+cNeogi. The older a neogi grows. the more colorful its hide becomes.&N
&+cEven in its translucent state the power of this neogi is truly &N
&+cimmense and it appears it is looking for new slaves. Those that won't&N
&+cbecome slaves willingly, are destroyed.&N

&n   Approximately nine feet in height and vaguely human in appearance, this
ethereal swimmer moves about the plane like a fish through water.  This
being is covered in a thin, translucent skin and the swimmer's internal
organs are plainly visible underneath.  It looks aquatic in nature, with
webbed hands and feet and fins protruding from its back.  It has no eyes
that you can see, no teeth or tongue in its mouth, and doesn't seem to
acknowledge the presense of any non-ethereal creatures.

signed an unholy pact with &+RAramus&n, the &+rD&+yr&+ge&+wa&+cm&+re&+ya&+gt&+we&+cr&n, Lord of the &+BEthereal&n

to trick the immortal Lord of &+rD&+yr&+ge&+wa&+cm&+rs&n... but &+RAramus&n learned of these plans
and destroyed the spirit of the mighty warrior, cursing him to live in the
eerie &+Bworld of dreams&n forever.

obviously deep within a battle rage and yearns only for the blood of his
opponents.

&+bA playful, fl&+Wu&+yff&+Wy&n &+ybunny hops through the woods.&n
~
Cuddly and cute almost to the point of being annoying, this fluffy rabbit
frolics through the trees, without a care in the world.  From time to time
though, you think you can see him look up at you with a &+rdeep, evil red
&+rgaze&n.  Nahhhh, it's only a rabbit.  Must be your imagination.

&+yA&n &+Yplayful&n &+ysquirrel frolics amongst the&n &+Rfl&+Yow&+Ger&+Cs&n.
~
Happy and carefree, this squirrel runs, leaps, and pounces on the flowers in
an endless happy and carefree game.  He chitters at the butterflies that
intrude on his playground, chitters at the birds in the trees, and chitters
at the wind as it blows playfully and carefree through the garden.  He
glances over at you, and for a millisecond, a feeling of &+Lsheer horror&n passes
through you.  Odd.  It is only a squirrel after all.

duckling duck fuzzy~
&+Ya fuzzy duckling&n~
&+YA fuzzy duckling splashes in the stream, playfully.&n
~
Splashing in the bubbling stream is a small duckling, probably only a few
weeks old.  Occassionally he lets out a loud quack at the little waterbugs
that swim across the surface of the water.  At other times, he dives into
the water chasing the bright, silvery minnows that populate the stream.
Every once in a while, he looks directly into your eyes, staring straight
into the depths of your soul and bringing your worst nightmares to the
surface... then he's back to quacking happily at the bugs and fish and you
stand wondering what the heck just happened.

&+CA young girl sits crying here, lost and alone.&n
~
A young human girl of about eight years of age, this poor thing sits cold
and lonely in the peaceful serenity of the garden.  Lost and with no idea of
how to get home, her angelic face has become wet with tears.  She looks up
when you enter, a bright ray of hope dawning on her face, her smile seeming
to light up the already pleasant forest.  Apparently you aren't what she was
hoping for, because she looks back down at the ground and starts to softly
cry again.

Thrashing about in a mindless rage, this ancient white oak tree whips its
branches around in a berserk manner.  Possessed by some demonic spirit of
the forest, it now hungers for the blood of any living being that tries to
pass north.

Possessed by some demonic spirit of the forest, this large jodani wood tree
has apparently moved to attempt to block passage north.  Its branches whip
around like a living tornado, mindless thrashing at the ground, other trees,
and anything foolish enough to be on the path.

No longer the young, crying human girl of eight years, a transformation has
taken place and before you now stands a towering being of pure, animalistic
fury.  Humanoid in appearance, with a perfectly formed naked body that glows
with power, this demoness is seductively beautiful as she attacks.
Lightning crackles from the her fingertips, and her four arms move in
impossibly quick physical attacks.

A well-built man in his sixties, Jeremiah stands in the cathedral's center
circle shouting at the top of his lungs at the other assembled clerics.
His face is bright red as he rages on about sin, heathen gods, and the
superiority of his religion.  His white robes flutter about him wildly as
he makes expansive gestures with his hands to punctuate his tirade.

rage.  She raves and rants at the other clerics in the circle, ignoring
the fact that none of them seem to be paying any attention to her speech.
Her hair is a brilliant purple color, obviously dyed.  Her lips match her
hair color, and her short black robe, covered in glittering sequence,
barely seems to cover her lithe frame.

A sickly looking goblin sputters and shouts at a group of clerics standing
in the middle of the cathedral.  The left side of his face looks like it
was struck with a heavy, blunt object and the skull actually dented in.
His left eye has been filmed over, and where his left ear should be there
is now only an ugly bump.  He stomps around in a small circular path as he
rants, doing small loops but never leaving the colored stone circle.

An withered, ancient dwarf parades around the center circle, gesturing
wildly as he rambles on about the differences between good and evil, the
power of the dwarven gods, and the future damnation of all non-dwarves.  A
pair of gold-rimmed spectacles are balanced precariously on his nose.
It's amazing they haven't fallen off yet, as he occassionlly whips his
head around at a new victim to shout at.

&+ccolors to signify power, rank, accomplishments, and warnings to other&N
&+cNeogi. The older a neogi grows. the more colorful its hide becomes.&N
&+cEven in its translucent state the power of this neogi is truly &N
&+cimmense and it appears it is looking for new slaves. Those that won't&N
&+cbecome slaves willingly, are destroyed.&N
