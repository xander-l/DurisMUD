Despite his friendly grin, the jailer looks tough and immovable.  Like all the
halfling guards he takes great pride in his work, and the fact that HE is the
one trusted with the only key to the jail door.

This jovial halfling keeps a close watch on everything that goes on in his
area.  Any disruptions to the peace, or violent acts will be met with
swift action.  Like most of the halfling guards this one has the eye-within-a-
sunburst tattoo that is rumored to give them the ability to see even invisible
and sneaking thieves.  This guard may not be as burly as some of his friends
but it is certain that one swift cry will bring many more.

Money makes halflings somewhat jovial, and this one seems permanently happy.
The tip of his nose appears to have been cut off at some time in the past, but
rather than detering from his appearance, it makes his smile seem larger and
happier, and somehow more trustworthy.  Every customer is treated with respect
and a smile making all who keep their money here satisfied that they are doing
the best thing.

Most halflings have a certain 'cuteness' about them but this halfling woman is
beautiful by any standard.  Her small features and broad smile make her one of
the friendliest halflings around.  In fact, her beauty is such that it is a
surprise to see her wearing the white tunic of the cathedral guards.  Her wood
cudgel looks to have seen a great deal of use at some time in the distant past
but it is obvious that layers of polish now cover the old gouges and dents in
the wood.

handsome if it weren't for the ugly sneer on his face.  It would almost seem
that the sneer is meant to cover up admiration for the beautiful cathedral the
halflings have constructed here.  Elves love to see buildings constructed in
harmony with nature, they just hate to see lesser races do such a good job of
it.

many years outside in the wind and sun, none of which have been able to slow
her down.  Despite the serene smile on her face, her eyes bear a haunting,
lonely quality.

and then looks down at his own grubby work clothes, obviously feeling out-of-
place here.  An ax is clung over his shoulder, seemingly forgotten as he looks
at everything around him.

everyone that visits here is intent on either praying to their god or looking
all the different statues in the beautiful cathedral.  Straw colored hair
frames her rather plain features.  Her silk dress does a good job of high-
lighting her more beautiful qualities and downplaying her more plain features.

the wood and buildings he sees in a glance, and almost ignoring everything
else.  His features seem soft and friendly but his hands are marked with
callouses and scars from his work.  When he actually notices someone looking
at him he smiles a greeting in their direction but is otherwise quite silent
and introspective for a halfling.

small halfling saw a number of battles before losing his sight.  Despite the
loss of his vision he is still able to carve beautiful animals by touch alone.
Though he can no longer see, within his own home he moves gracefully and
without any of the hesitations that one might expect.

Halflings welcome anyone of good intentions into their beautiful town, and this

customer that walks in he sings in a clear voice that can be heard through
all of the talking at the bar.  There is a sadness in his eyes, and it is
obvious that he is used to playing some sort of instrument as he sings
because his hands strum at empty air.  Why he has decided not to play his
instrument today is a mystery for he certainly seems to miss it.

up in his own private thoughts and completely ignores everything that is going
on around him.  It is hard to imagine anything that would make a halfing so
pensive and withdrawn, but it seems best to just leave him to his ale.

halfling sleeping drunk patron~
a sleepy drunk~
A bar patron snores off his drink beneath one of the tables.
~
It is sad to see that some people just don't know when to stop drinking.  This
poor fellow has had far more to drink than he should have and has lost the
battle against the sleep the alcohol has dragged him into.  What is even more
surprising is that the bartender hasn't thrown him out.

Clearly, this gentleman needs to sit down and start drinking water instead of
ale.  Exactly what or who gave him the idea he should attempt to sing is
criminal.  It is quite fortunate that people in the area are also drunk enough
to think his vain attempts are funny, otherwise he may have been hurt by now.

plain to see that he is quite well-liked, and that his fish sell quite well.

It is interesting to note that, despite his grouchiness, this food vendor does
extremely good business.  He is happy to sell meals to anyone that wishes to
purchase them, but makes it clear that they should be eaten elsewhere.  This
might be due to his age, it is easy to understand that he might not want to
have to clean up after people once they leave, but the food he sells could
easily be served in a fine, expensive restaurant.

most experienced of mages, once they have proven their worth, leaving the
instruction of the junior mages to the librarians and instructors downstairs.
Rumors that she has taken to summoning demons in order to learn more about
the inner workings of magical spells have frightened all but the heartiest of
mages away from her private chambers.

about him and allow his bonds to weaken so that he may go free.  The look on
his face is one of agony, here he is on the material plane, yet unable to
create the havoc that he truely desires.  When Azoum asks him anything he
responds promptly, hoping that quick answers will lead her to free him.  When
he is noticed by anyone else in the tower he bares his fangs and flaps his
small vestigal wings to frighten them away, there is no real fear from him
though.  It is obviously just another tactic to get freed, he hopes that enough
rumors and fear will force Azoum to send him back.  Until he is freed he has
no choice but to serve his summoner, though nobody said he had to be happy about
it.

Her feathers are speckled with brown and white spots to make her more difficult
to see among the reeds.  Her poor young ducklings are such a bright fuzzy
&+Wwhite&N that they are easy prey for the turtles and large fish that are
waiting for her to stop paying attention to her young.

&+LA halfling logger is here harvesting&+r jodani wood.&N
~
Callouses line his hands where he holds onto his ax and grips the saws used to
cut the wood from the trees.  His work is very important to him, he works
cautiously and carefully with the other loggers that make up a small team that
harvests wood from the beautiful jodani trees.  Sap from the fresh wood gives
him a fresh woodsy smell on top of the sweat from the hard work he has been
doing.

of anything it meets.  This inquisitive squirrel doesn't even fear the loggers

A young bounty-hunter is here practicing.
~
Barely finished with his youth, this young halfling has the bright look of
somebody very new to the work of bounty-hunting.  His bright blue eyes have
a youthful innocence that will soon depart, if he survives long that is.  Hair
the color of the wooden spear he holds has been tied back behind his head to
keep it out of his way.

An elderly bounty-hunter is here to train the younger ones.
~
The lines on his face combined with the gray streaks in his hair and scars
along his arms mark him as someone that has seen a great deal of fighting and
still survived to an old age.  He laughs at the younger bounty-hunters, knowing
that sometime soon they won't have such a bright outlook on life.  Something
about having to hunt down and deal with criminals tends to make anybody a
cynic.

she watches the others practice, it is clear that though one of only a few
halfling woman to ever take up bounty-hunting, she is one of the finest bounty-
hunters that money can buy.

skin, though darkened somewhat by the sun, is still paler than most of the

to see his deeply set pale green eyes.  In fact, the color of his eyes alone
detracts from the ferocious appearance that he wants to portray.

just not as often as people with more money.  He saves these trips for special
occasions.  Even though he has been here before his green eyes are wide open
as he gawks at the finery of the restaurant, astonished at the money that must
have gone into its creation.

the farmer's wife~
&+yThe wife of a simple farmer smiles with pleasure as she looks around.&N
~
Though she may be a simple farmer's wife, she is one of the most beautiful
halfling women in all of Woodseer.  Her beauty glows from both outside and in
and her twinkling green eyes seem to glow when she speaks.  When she speaks,
everyone in the room pauses to listen because her voice, if anything, surpasses
her physical beauty.  She smiles at her husband, and glows when he returns her
smile.  Part of her beauty must come from the deep satisfaction she has with
her life, which is made more clear with everything she says and does.

A halfling logger is relaxing with a few drinks.
~
This simple woodcutter must be one of those that treks into the jungle to bring
back the rare and valuable woods.  He looks extremely tough, yet has a patience
about him that is difficult to fathom.  Clearly, whatever he does, he has
enough money to drink at the most expensive bar in town.

eat some of the fine food that is served here.  Not only must he have great
skill to afford such fine clothing, but he also has excellent taste.  His
blue silk shirt matches his eyes perfectly and plays a fine counterpart to his
raven black hair.

This stately elven woman is obviously a merchant that is used to traveling.
Unlike many elves she shows no disdain for the other races around her, and she
seems quite interested in tasting halfling high cuisine.  Her eyes are almost
golden and her hair is thin and pale, and, though short, she is still taller
than the halflings that surround her.

appears that she is deeply contemplating something, though what that might
be is difficult to say.  Her rosy cheeks have been pleasantly colored by the
sun and wind, and her light brown hair slowly curls its way past her shoulders,
bouncing with every step she takes.

heavily ordered specials here is the turtle soup, a spicy flavorful concoction
that is well loved throughout the city.  The soup tastes excellent, but the
maitre d' winces everytime another bowl is ordered.  Thin worry lines are form
on his brow with every order, whatever is worrying him has something to do with
the turtle soup.

This tremendous elemental has been summoned and placed here to help guard

adjusted to its new watery home and seems content with its guardianship.
However, it is hard to believe that it is truely satisfied with its existence
here so it would be unwise to disturb it.  The water that flows over it from
above and in the pool here that surrounds it seem to feed it and give it
strength.

This guard was clearly chosen for his size and ability to intimidate.  Burly
arms seem to sprout from his body and dark curly hair falls to his shoulders.
For some reason his curly hair makes him look larger, it seems to be a mark
of the gate guards for all of them have long curly hair.  The classic tattoo
of the Woodseer guards marks his forehead, showing that he too is able to find
the criminals that try to use magic to sneak by.  His grim green eyes survey
everything that goes by, it is hard to believe that such a vigilant guard
would even need magical assistance to help keep watch.

This handsome halfling is one of several employed by Ctenmir to assist the
customers.  He wears a smile that seems etched into his smooth face.  Despite
his pleasant looks and large smile, there is something sinister about his
dark eyes and the way he carefully examines every customer.  He is of an
average build, but he has a smooth even gait that is closer to the stride of
a cat than a halfling.

He is much smaller than most of the other halfling guards, for that matter,
he is smaller than most halflings.  Several scars on his left cheek make his
green eyes look dark and mysterious.  It is clear from his attire that he is
not a warrior, magic is his weapon, and his strength.  He, like many of the
halfling guards, has devoted his life to the protection of Woodseer, and will
travel anywhere and fight any battles he feels are necessary to that end.  The
tattoos that all of the guards possess are clearly shown on his forehead and,
though they may be marred by a scar through them, they certainly retain their
power.

appears to be one of those people that can travel anywhere, through any type
of conditions, and still look beautiful.  Her golden hair has been pulled back
into a tight pony tail to keep from blocking her view of the world.  Though
she wears a constant smile, it is clear that she is more than capable of doing
anything she is required to do.

He stands here healing people in exchange for tithes to his god.  His kindness
may be a bit of a show though, he refuses to heal anyone that doesn't pay the
proper tithe.  Despite the huge amounts of money he takes in, he is dressed in
the simplest of robes, looking poorer than many beggars.  Clear blue eyes
survey visitors to the cathedral searching out those in need of his aid.

famous as Jarus or Gael, it is clear that he is easily as much a warrior as
either of them.  Dust from his many deliveries seems to cling to him, acting
as more a sign of his dedication than lack of cleanliness.  Constantly ready
to take and deliver messages, he has saved many merchants from ruin with his
quick deliveries.

remain clean despite all her dirty work.  Flecks of yellow and brown are
scattered through her pale green eyes, eyes which seem to absorb every
detail around her.  She gives every customer a smile, but pays special
attention to those that clearly care for their animals well.

laid over its back making it clear that someone uses this beast as a
mount.

around.  Adventurers have been known to go to bed on what they thought was a

darkness that seems light when compared to the darkness that seems to seep out
of it from within.

that provide such fine lumber to the craftsmen of Woodseer.  Confidently
walking through the jungle with his hands on his axe, he has been left alone by
creatures that would otherwise threaten most people foolish enough to be here.

one would guess that there has had to be some sort of magic involved in its

that dot the area outside its dark pupils.  The way it slowly paces back and
forth watching everything around it would almost seem to indicate that this
creature is extremely intelligent.  There is a strange jewelled collar around
its neck, but it is hard to imagine anyone actually being able to tame such a
tremendous beast.  Perhaps there is something more to this creature than meets
the eye.

tattoos that enable him to find any sneaky criminals that try to stalk

Smiling calmly at all that pass by, this halfling guard has obviously seen a

the strange tattoo on his forehead is supposed to allow him to see both
invisible and sneaking thieves as well as helping detect whether or not any

halflings have constructed here.  Elves love to see buildings constructed in
harmony with nature, they just hate to see lesser races do such a good job of
it.

everyone that visits here is intent on either praying to their god or looking

Halflings welcome anyone of good intentions into their beautiful town, and this

customer that walks in he sings in a clear voice that can be heard through
all of the talking at the bar.  There is a sadness in his eyes, and it is
obvious that he is used to playing some sort of instrument as he sings
because his hands strum at empty air.  Why he has decided not to play his
instrument today is a mystery for he certainly seems to miss it.

Clearly, this gentleman needs to sit down and start drinking water instead of
ale.  Exactly what or who gave him the idea he should attempt to sing is
criminal.  It is quite fortunate that people in the area are also drunk enough
to think his vain attempts are funny, otherwise he may have been hurt by now.

This small halfling has made his living selling the fish that are caught in
the lake and the river.  It is hard to tell whether it is the fish that have
created the strong aroma or if it is the vendor himself due to his constant
exposure to them.  He smiles happily at everyone that comes by, and it is
plain to see that he is quite well-liked, and that his fish sell quite well.

It is interesting to note that, despite his grouchiness, this food vendor does
extremely good business.  He is happy to sell meals to anyone that wishes to
purchase them, but makes it clear that they should be eaten elsewhere.  This
might be due to his age, it is easy to understand that he might not want to
have to clean up after people once they leave, but the food he sells could
easily be served in a fine, expensive restaurant.

most experienced of mages, once they have proven their worth, leaving the
instruction of the junior mages to the librarians and instructors downstairs.
Rumors that she has taken to summoning demons in order to learn more about
the inner workings of magical spells have frightened all but the heartiest of
mages away from her private chambers.

about him and allow his bonds to weaken so that he may go free.  The look on
his face is one of agony, here he is on the material plane, yet unable to
create the havoc that he truely desires.  When Azoum asks him anything he
responds promptly, hoping that quick answers will lead her to free him.  When
he is noticed by anyone else in the tower he bares his fangs and flaps his
small vestigal wings to frighten them away, there is no real fear from him
though.  It is obviously just another tactic to get freed, he hopes that enough
rumors and fear will force Azoum to send him back.  Until he is freed he has
no choice but to serve his summoner, though nobody said he had to be happy about
it.

very sharp, nasty looking teeth.  This is the type of fish caught for sport,
it looks far to bony to be worth the fight for the food.  It ponders
everything that wanders into its part of the lake with intelligent and wary
eyes.  This fish does NOT want to be caught.

Odd markings along his forearm would seem to indicate some sort of affiliation
with a guild of some sort.

This elegant woman is obviously fairly old, but still extremely beautiful.  She
sits peacefully mending a few socks while humming softly to herself.  Her soft
brown hair has long streaks of white that somehow seem to highlight her high
cheekbones making her look elegant rather than old.  Still beautiful now, she
was certainly quite a wonder in her younger days.

A dark hood covers this ones face and long robes conceal his body, but he walks
with a purpose that cannot be denied.  His robes, though concealing, by their
design and make are also revealing, they show that he can only be a mage.
Mages like this are both feared and respected, and are often quite cautious
when they travel.

Gray streaks run through this kind-looking halfling woman's hair and thin lines
beside her eyes crinkle when she smiles.  She has been one of Woodseer's
council members for quite some time and is quite happy she is going to retire
soon, but until that time she intends to serve her people well.

the halfling councilor~
A plainly dressed member of the Woodseer high council stares out his windows.
~
A smile seems permanently attached to his face, a face whose primary feature
is a large nose that is twisted to one side.  Dark green eyes are framed by
bushy black eyebrows and a black mane that stretches down past his shoulders.
This halfling has clearly seen his share of battles and parties, and seems
equally ready for either.

Pale blond hair frames an equally pale face.  It is surprising to see such a
pale fisherman, long days in the sun should add some color to his skin.  It is
possible that he is one of those that feels it is best to fish in the early
morning hours just before the sun has risen, but even then he should still
have to spend some time in the sun.

A wealthy human merchant walks through town.

The sneer on his face shows that this human is obviously used to the larger
stone buildings seen in the major human cities.  Oddly enough, halflings from
Woodseer wear the same sneer when they see large stone buildings, they believe
"real" buildings are built of wood.  He would be handsome, for a human, if
he didn't have a sneer twisting the left side of his face into an almost
brutal grimace.

This purpled robed wonder must have a bottomless gut, and a strong resistance
to alcohol.  Most halflings would be dead by now with the quantity he has been
drinking.  At this bar, you can drink as long as you want, if you have the
money.  It is clear that this gentleman has plenty of money, he even has REAL
gold painted on his fingernails.  Despite all he has been drinking he is thin
and scrawny, and would have a difficult time beating up an alley cat.

halfling women in all of Woodseer.  Her beauty glows from both outside and in
and her twinkling green eyes seem to glow when she speaks.  When she speaks,
everyone in the room pauses to listen because her voice, if anything, surpasses
her physical beauty.  She smiles at her husband, and glows when he returns her
smile.  Part of her beauty must come from the deep satisfaction she has with
her life, which is made more clear with everything she says and does.

However, it is hard to believe that it is truely satisfied with its existance
here so it would be unwise to disturb it.  The water that flows over it from

For some reason his curly hair makes him look larger, it seems to be a mark
of the gate guards for all of them have long curly hair.  The classic tattoo
of the Woodseer guards marks his forehead, showing that he too is able to find
the criminals that try to use magic to sneak by.  His grim green eyes survey
everything that goes by, it is hard to believe that such a vigilant guard
would even need magical assistance to help keep watch.

he is smaller than most halflings.  Several scars on his left cheek make his

not a warrior, magic is his weapon, and his strength.  He, like many of the
halfling guards, has devoted his life to the protection of Woodseer, and will
travel anywhere and fight any battles he feels are necessary to that end.  The
tattoos that all of the guards possess are clearly shown on his forehead and,
though they may be marred by a scar through them, they certainly retain their
power.

may be a bit of a show though, he refuses to heal anyone that doesn't pay the
proper tithe.  Despite the huge amounts of money he takes in, he is dressed in

halfling gate gateguard guard burly~
&+Ra burly guardian&N~
&+RA burly halfling stands here guarding the gate from invasion.&N
~
This guard was clearly chosen for his size and ability to intimidate.  Burly
arms seem to sprout from his body and dark curly hair falls to his shoulders.
For some reason his curly hair makes him look larger, it seems to be a mark
of the gate guards for all of them have long curly hair.  The classic tattoo
of the Woodseer guards marks his forehead, showing that he too is able to find
the criminals that try to use magic to sneak by.  His grim green eyes survey
everything that goes by, it is hard to believe that such a vigilant guard
would even need magical assistance to help keep watch.

~
The lieutenant watches everything around him with a confident air.   His
confidence is bourne of the many battles he has fought in the defense of
Woodseer and his adventuring in the nearby jungle.  His alligatorskin armor is
a sign of his status among the guards.  Such armor is expensive, the Woodseer
Council must value his service a great deal.

mark the length of his forearms.  Nothing would phase this skilled warrior and
the strange tattoo on his forehead is supposed to allow him to see both
invisible and sneaking thieves as well as helping detect whether or not any
particular individual has any evil intentions.

is also responsible for keeping the path along the cliffs clear of jungle
growth.  The happy smile on his face shows that he is quite content with his

watching every quivering leaf to make certain that none of the jungle
denizens have again decided to attack Woodseer or any of the merchant
caravans that come to visit it.  He seems to have the strange ability to
blend in with his surroundings, probably by the way he stands so perfectly
still as he keeps watch.

&+ga bullywug scout&n~
&+gA bullywug scout watches for invaders.&N
~
This odd frog-like creature's &+Lgray&n and &+ggreen&n mottled body blends in
well with the surrounding jungle making it easy for it to hide.  This amphibian
humanoid has huge bulbous eyes that enable it to see even in the smallest
amount of light. Though as small as a halfling, it has a ferocious look about
it that dares anything to be foolish enough to challenge it.

bullywug sentinel~
&+ga &+ybullywug &+gsentinel&n~
&+yAn ugly brown and &+ggreen&N &+ybullywug sentinel stands watch.&N
~
This bullywugs brown and green skin helps it hide amongst the jungle foliage
but certainly adds nothing to its looks.  Perhaps he is handsome by the
standards of his frog-like kind, but anyone else would fine his ugly skin and
strange &+Yyellow&N bulbous eyes to be quite repulsive.  His skin glistens with
the moisture of the jungle, which is good, for this amphibian needs to stay
warm and wet.

black cat huge jakar~
&+La jakar&N~
&+LA huge black cat prowls here, defending its territory.&N
~
This cat is far larger than any cat ever seen.  In fact, it is so large that
one would guess that there has had to be some sort of magic involved in its
growth.  Its eyes are an odd &+gemerald green&n with thin &+Ygolden&N flecks
that dot the area outside its dark pupils.  The way it slowly paces back and
forth watching everything around it would almost seem to indicate that this
creature is extremely intelligent.  There is a strange jewelled collar around
its neck, but it is hard to imagine anyone actually being able to tame such a
tremendous beast.  Perhaps there is something more to this creature than meets
the eye.

the kenku adventurer~
&+yA kenku adventurer wanders the forest seeking fame and fortune.&N
~
This odd looking bird-man looks extremely well-prepared for any contingency.
His oddly shaped armor has been designed to allow him the limited flight of his
kind as well as protect him from harm.  His sharp beak and closely held dagger
help threaten anything that might attempt to harm him.  The best protection
though are his mottled brown feathers which help him fade into the shadows and
hide in the event of real danger.

halfling sentinel~
&+La halfling sentinel&N~
&+LA halfling sentinel keeps a close watch on the mountains&N
~
Dark grey clothing helps him blend into the shadows of the plain stone
that surrounds him.  This halfling has a grim determination about him,
showing that no matter how irrelevant this trail may be, he will defend
it with his life, insuring that nobody prevents traders from making it
to Woodseer.  He is marked with the tattos of the halfing guards,
tattoos that enable him to find any sneaky criminals that try to stalk
through the shadows unseen.

goat mountain~
a small mountain goat~
A small mountain goat wanders here searching for food.
~
Clearly not one of the largest of mountain goats, this small creature
seems content to prance nimbly through the mountains looking for food.
Despite its small size, mountain trails are often narrow enough that it
can certainly be a nuisance.

eagle golden brown~
&+yan eagle&N~
&+yA golden-brown eagle soars through the mountains.
~
This tremendous creature has sharp talons and a nasty-looking beak, and
looks more than capable of using them.  Exactly what it is hunting, or
even if it is hunting is unclear.  What is obvious though, is that
nobody in their right mind wants to attack or anger it.
