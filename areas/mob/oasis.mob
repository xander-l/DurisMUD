   This Mountain Dwarf appears to be incredibly strong.  Decades of pounding
away with a massive smithy's hammer have increased both his stamina and his
strength. Care should be taken before trifling with a man of his stature.  His
dark eyes reflect the sparks which fly off his hammer with every strike upon
the enormous anvil.  The hammer which he wields with ease in his right hand
looks heavy enough to be a struggle for even a Barbarian.

and is certainly not a man to be underestimated, for he not only knows weapons;
he knows how to use them.

drought or a food shortage.  The troubles which seem to be bothering the mayor
on this day, however, seem to be far more critical.

with he holds in his right hand.  Many scuff marks in the floor of his house
suggest that the captain tends to stand that way quite often.

~
   The females of the mantis species are far more rare, and grow to about ten
times the size of the average male mantis.  It is unknown what classifies the
queen of the hive, but perhaps size is a factor.  This beast is dragon sized,
and inspires the same amount of awe.  The queen of the hive has a deep green
tint to her skin.  She lets out a spine-tingling shreak upon approach.  It's
hard to discern if she is screaming in anger or delight at the sight of food.
The enormous beast lunges forward to attack, with all four limbs poised to
rend flesh from their limbs.
