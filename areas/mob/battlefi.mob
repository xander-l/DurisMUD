&+LA vicious and ferocious leader, this minotaur moved up the ranks in this army
&+Lincredibly fast.  Her task now is to mop up the battlefield of any remaining
&+Lopposition that might have survived, of course, this means spearing almost every

&+Lto her task, and will not stop until it is finished, however, she seems to be
&+Lsearching the cadavers, looking for something...

A patrolling &+Lguard&n protects the camp.

&+LThis massive beast of a minotaur glances about the immediate area as if
&+Lexpecting the unexpected. Being caught unaware could mean the death of his
&+Lcomrades, and a vicious flogging by his peers. Soldiers die often in this
&+Lrealm, however, only the strong manage to survive multiple battles, as this
&+Lminotaur has. His battle scars along his body are blantly evident.

&+yA &+rballista&+y prepares to launch its missiles.
~
&+yThis ballista is manned by a couple of halfling engineers.  Their objective is
&+ysimple, to destroy the parapet to the south and the evil soldiers within it.
&+yFrom the make of this ballista, it seems well adequate for the task, for it
&+ywas made by the dwarven hand, alongside the gnome ingenuity.  Perhaps the
&+ymissiles that it projects were created by their human counter parts.
&+yRegardless of who built it, it is deadly none the less.  The halfling soldiers
&+ywithin it are very well guarded against a frontal conflict, for they are
&+yburrowed into the heart of the machine and are not visible to the naked eye.
&+yA little peep hole allows them visual contact with the scenario.  Atop of the
&+yballista is where the projectiles are loaded, anything from small trees to
&+yburning spears can be launched from this pad.  It would utterly destroy a
&+ybuilding, and obliterate any being from the face of this planet.

&+yThis ballista is manned by a couple of halfling engineers.  Their objective is

&+yFrom the make of this ballista, it seems well adequate for the task, for it
&+ywas made by the dwarven hand, alongside the gnome ingenuity.  Perhaps the
&+ymissiles that it projects were created by their human counter parts.
&+yRegardless of who built it, it is deadly none the less.  The halfling soldiers
&+ywithin it are very well guarded against a frontal conflict, for they are
&+yburrowed into the heart of the machine and are not visible to the naked eye.
&+yA little peep hole allows them visual contact with the scenario.  Atop of the
&+yballista is where the projectiles are loaded, anything from small trees to
&+yburning spears can be launched from this pad.  It would utterly destroy a
&+ybuilding, and obliterate any being from the face of this planet.

dragon shadow xillianith~
&+rXillianith&n~
&+rXillianith&+R the &+Lshadow &+rdragon&+R roars vehemently!
~
&+rThis summoned dragon awaits its master's command. Its black scales gives
&+rrise to the name 'shadow dragon'. This monster of a dragon could engulf an
&+rentire army in flames if it wanted. Its mass is greater than any living
&+rdragon on the mortal realm, and its power is unrivaled.

&+La zombie of a &+ysmall halfling&n~
&+LA zombie of a &+ysmall halfling&+L lays here.
~
&+LHaving been deprived of his eternal sleep, this wretched soul has to wander
&+Lthe mortal planes forever in his ragged state.  Only if its soul is cast into
&+Loblivion can it rest forever in peace.  Its limbs look ready to fall off at
&+Lany given moment, its moans never cease.  Its charcoal colored skin readily
&+Ldrop to the ground, for its flesh rots steadily.  Its eyes glow an odd color
&+Ggreen&+L, indeed, it is scary.

snake small~
&+ga small snake~
&+gA small snake slithers away.
~
&+gThis tiny reptile slithers deeper into the forest.  It becomes easily startled
&+gwhen it detects an outside presence within the forest.  Its scales are rather
&+gslimy and moist, for the sunlight has never reached them.  The sounds it
&+gcreates as it rattles the fallen leaves and bushes is unnerving.

&+RA many one eyed beast swirls its tentacles here.
~
&+RThis fantastic beast has about fifty eyes. It hovers just off the ground, for
&+Rit is magi in nature. The tentacles that hang beneath him stir gentle as they
&+Rsearch for something to thrash.

disgruntled sleeping soldier~
&+La disgruntled so&+cl&+Cd&+ci&+Ler&n~
&+LA sleeping soldier sits here.&n
~
&+LThis soldier looks to have had a long day, and simply wants to relax and sleep.
&+LScars along his back hint that he has seen action, and the dents in his armor,
&+Llying off to the side, also attest to that.  It is easy to irrate a sleeping
&+Lsoldier, so the unspoken rule in these barracks is simple, keep your mouth
&+Lshut or we'll cut your damn tongue out.
