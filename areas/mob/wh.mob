   Celarno's simple purple robes, and humble oak-hewn staff disguise the
fact that she's an ethermancer of eminent power quite well.  Ever the
perfectionist, she works on her experiments -- attempting to channel the
elements to develop some sort of new spell.  To finance her studies, she
has agreed to teach new ethermancers in the Tower and help them develop
their own powers.  She will help you, as well.

   This ancient minotaur has seen hundreds of battles and it shows.
Deep scars run across his face and arms, and one of his horns has broken
off.  He wears nothing else outside of simple brown cloth robes and a
bone necklace with shamanic charms attached to each segment.  He is
sitting on a straw mat, meditating, with a blank expression on his face.
Despite his rough appearance, one feels at peace standing in the room
with him.  Duule has taught many would-be shamans how to enhance their
powers, and he will be happy to help you enhance yours.
