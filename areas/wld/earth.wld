&+yApproaching a Large Mountain&n~
&+m   Tall trees tower overhead. Their branches full of brown and green foliage.
&+mThe thick limbs and trunks blocking all views skyward. Small thorny vines and
&+mbrush rise forth from the earth, grasping and clawing at all that pass through
&+mthe area. The small bushy shrubs creating a thin wall that would appear to be
&+mblocking one from travelling closer to the mountain that lies just ahead. A
&+mfew of the large trees have been uprotted from the ground as though a
&+mlumbering giant made its way through the area a short time ago. On the ground
&+mare small brown pebbles. The rocks obviously out of place in the otherwise
&+mfoliage covered floor of this dense jungle.&n

&+yAt the Base of a Large Mountain&n~
&+g   The jungle abrubtly ends at this massive mountain of jagged rock that&n
&+gextends from the ground to the sky like the walls of a fortress separating&n
&+gthis portion of the jungle from what may lie on the otherside. The&n
&+gmountains are an eerie black color of porous rock formed during the volcanic&n
&+geruptions that created this tropical island centuries ago. An almost&n
&+gdeafening high-pitched whistling sound is created as the wind blows through&n
&+gthe mountains. A &+Lbl&+wa&+Lck &+ghaze is visible midway up the mountain, formed as the&n
&+gwind picks up thick gray volcanic ash creating a veil of darkness that&n
&+gobscurres the mou&+ynta&+gins peak. A ravine is visible to the east and appears&n
&+gto twist its way up the mountain.&n

&+yAt the Base of a Large Mountain&n~
&+g   The peaks of large mountains are barely visible beyond the branches and
&+glimbs that comprise the jungle ceiling. Stretching toward the north, and
&+gonly visible as the fierce wind blows the jungle canopy, stands a jagged
&+gmountain range. Tall trees tower skyward. Their branches and limbs stretching
&+goverhead to block out the sun and stars. Imprinted on a few of the trees
&+gabout the height of a human, are intricate runes. At first glance one would
&+gassume the runes were crafted by wood &+cElves &+gdue to their intricate designs and
&+gsharp, precise angles. An unseen force radiates from within the center of the
&+grunes, throbbing at ones soul, almost forcing their eyes to trace the
&+gintricately carved patterns.&n

&+yAt the Base of a Large Mountain&n~
&+g   Rising forth from the ground and blocking the area that lies directly to
&+gthe north is a large and jagged mountain range. The center mountain rises
&+guntil the peaks meet the &+Bsk&+Cyl&+Bin&+Ce&+g. From the outer edges of the monstrous
&+gcenter peak the other smaller mountains taper off to the east and west. The
&+gsupporting mountains standing firm as though supporting the main peak. To the
&+geast and west the jagged peaks take the shape of a crescent moon. From this
&+gdistance one would assume that the precision of the peaks are not natural
&+gbut rather formed by some magic.&n

&+LOn a Steep Mountain Path&n~
&+y   Weaving its way through the mountain range is a wide ravine. The caps of
&+ythe peaks are still covered with &+Wsnow &+yleading one to believe the ravine was
&+yformed centuries ago as the ice caps melted. The torrential streams cutting
&+ythrough the mountain like a hot forge forming this deep ravine. The walls
&+ythat border the ravine are shear and upon inspection one would notice no
&+yvisible cracks or crevices that would allow them to be scaled. A few puddles
&+yof water lie stagnate in the small depressions in the ground. A thin film of
&+ygreen algae grows along the edges of the water.&n

&+LTravelling through a Ravine&n~
&+y   Slicing up and down the mountain like a ravenous snake, this wide ravine
&+yappears to be the safest path to reach the top of the mountain. Sheer walls
&+yrise up along both sides of the ravine. The walls are comprised of a smooth
&+yrock and have the appearance of wet granite. There are no visible cracks or
&+yholds on the sides by which one could scale the walls. The top peaks of the
&+yadjoining mountains are barely visible beyond the ridge ahead. The closest
&+ypeak appears to be shaped like a crescent moon. Visible to the east is a
&+ynarrow ledge that appears to to lead along a path around the mountains side.&n

&+yFrom this vantage point one has a clear view of the jungle that surrounds
&+ythe mountain ridge. Barely visible through the thick foliage is the hacked
&+ytrail leading to the base of the mountain directly in front of the ravine
&+yjust traveled. Peering out over the ledge one makes certain that their hands
&+yare firmly grasping the side of the mountain, for one slip of footing would
&+ymean certain death.&n

&+LStanding Before a Large Stone Door&n~
&+y   A large stone door stands to the north. It would appear that the doors are
&+ynot hinged to the mountain, but rather a part of the mountain itself. Small
&+ysemi-circular grooves are visible along the ground. As the massive doors are
&+yopened, they slide along the grooves. Large iron circles are bolted into the
&+ydoors about mid-height. The thick bands of &+ciron &+yused as grips to pull the
&+ydoors ajar along the grooves on the ground. Judging by the size of the bands,
&+yand height of the doors, it would take a golem or giant to open these massive
&+yslabs of stone. Barely visible along the outer edges of the doors are sets of
&+yintricately carved runes. The runes, although chiseled into the stone,
&+yappear to be written as though on paper. The intricate shapes and precise
&+yangles leaving one with the impression that a great runesmaster etched this
&+yward centuries ago to protect those dwelling within the Temple of the Earth.&n

&+LApproaching a Large Stone Door&n~
&+y   To the north one can make out what appears to be a large stone door. The
&+yactual size of the door, at least from this distance, appears to stand as tall
&+yas a stone giant. Thick rings are visible from this distance and one would
&+yassume that it would take the strength og a giant to move the door. To the
&+yeast the ledge extends from the mountain side. If one were to walk to the
&+yledge they would have a clear unobstructed view of the jungle below. A few
&+yclouds flow past the area. The white vapor temporarily obstructing ones view.
&+yAs the wind shifts and carries the vapor away, the view becomes clear again.&n

&+LEntryway to the Temple of the Earth&n~
&+y   This large circular entryway leads from the entrance to the south, to
&+ydeeper within the Temple of the Earth. The temple and its priests once
&+yprovided guidance to all inhabitants of Duris on harnessing earth based
&+yspells. However, after years of watching bloodshed and never ending wars, as
&+ymortals abused the powers of the earth for their own gains, the priests vowed
&+yto live in seclusion, shunning all those not of their sect. As one glances
&+yabout their surroundings they stand in awe of this massive entryway. The
&+yfloor, comprised of sheer slabs of granite, is slightly slanted leading one
&+ydeeper into the mountain. The ceiling is arched and would appear to provide
&+yenough room for a giant or earthen &+Lgolem &+yto move freely about. Metal brackets
&+yare mounted into the walls of the entryway. The brackets would appear to
&+yprovide a place for one to hang torches, although now a small ball of faerie
&+yfire &+Willuminates &+ythe room.&n

&+ywith each gust of wind, the light is reflected off the mithril. The reflected
&+ylight casting an eerie array of shadows along the floor and further into this
&+ydwelling. Rows of stone pews line the far side of the room. The pews all

&+LA Guard's Cave&n~
&+y   This shallow cave serves as a guard shack for those priests that have
&+yvowed to keep the Temple of the Earth safe from outsiders. The cave, although
&+yshallow, is extremely wide. The first thing one notices upon entering the cave
&+yis that there are little comforts indicating the dwellers have forsaken the
&+ycreature comforts enjoyed by most races on Duris. A few pieces of wood
&+ystacked in the corner of the cave, and a small mound of ash, indicate that at
&+yleast the occupants have not forgotten how to start a fire. Dried leaves and
&+ytwigs are woven into mats that lie atop the rocky floor. The mats, with
&+ynumerous protruding twigs, would be uncomfortable for most races, however the
&+yzealots that guard the temple gain their power from their gods and have
&+ytranscended mortal bounds.&n

&+LCrossing a Narrow Stone Bridge&n~
&+y   The mountain walls separate away from the mountain ledge. As one examines
&+ytheir position they realize they are standing on a narrow stone bridge. The
&+ybridge formed by a stone arch beneath. Should too much weight be placed on
&+yits center, the thin rock would appear to break, sending one directly to their
&+ydeath. As there are no mountain walls to provide protection from the elements,
&+ythe winds gathers force, howling furiously at all that trespass through the
&+yarea. The screaming pitch as the wind travels between and through the rocks is
&+yboth thundering and deafining. The only recourse being to crouch and crawl
&+ylike an infant across the remainder of the bridge.&n

&+LA Connecting Passageway&n~
&+y   Leading from chamber to chamber, this hall would appear to have once been a
&+ylava tube. Centuries ago, as lava rose forth from within the hellish bowels of
&+yDuris, the molten rock cut through the weaker stones on its way to the
&+ysurface. Often pooling in chambers before cooling, the intense heat generated
&+yby the large pools of lava often forced narrow streams of lava into adjoining
&+ychambers. The walls of the hall are of a porous rock. Small holes are visible
&+yalong its surface. A thin grit of sand, almost like dust,  has collected on
&+ythe otherwise spotless floor. The sand having fallen from within the small
&+yholes on the wall. Unlike the other chambers where brackets are mounted along
&+ythe wall holding torches or some other form of light, a single ball of &+Mf&+ma&+Me&+mr&+Mi&+me
&+Mf&+mi&+Mr&+me &+yfloats at the center of the ceiling. The magical enchantment casting an
&+yeeire glow along this corridor. The light providing enough illumination by
&+ywhich one can travel, although what lies just ahead remains blanketed in

&+ychamber is richly decorated with intricately carved statues as well as great
&+yspiraling columns. The columns stretching from the floor to the ceiling which
&+ystands at least a hundred feet in the air. The ceiling, the center being the
&+yhighest spot, is shaped like an arch. Intricate runes are etched on each of
&+ythe columns that run the length of the chamber. Each rune is different as a
&+ystrenge hued colored glow radiates from the columns. Small diamonds set into
&+ythe walls collect the light from the runes and focuses it onto a single
&+ystatue that stands at the far end of the chamber. The light collects at the
&+ystatues eyes giving it an horrific demeanor.&n

&+yleave one to believe that those priests that travel this corridor know
&+yevery turn of the passageway or that they wish their presence to go

&+Lpurpose being to keep unwanted travelers from reaching whatever may lie in

&+Lstepping. The cavern walls slope inward narrowing the path being walked. At
&+Lsome points the path becomes so narrow that it would be difficult for two
&+Lpersons to walk abreast. One quickly realizes that the cavern is guiding any
&+Lwho are unfamiliar with its layout to a position where they can not defend
&+Lthemselves. The fog intensifies as one continues down this path.&n

&+LMoving through a &+WM&+wi&+Ws&+wt&+Wy &+LCatacomb&n~
&+L   Suspended high in the air is what appears to be stone slabs erected to form
&+La path by which one could travel. The narrow slabs stretch from the caverns
&+Labove to each of the hundreds of stalagmites. Barely visible in the darkness
&+Labove are openings within the stalagmites which would allow travelers to pass
&+Lthrough on their way to another section of this great chasm. Visible along the
&+Lcavern floor, covered with a small amount of dust, are large &+Wc&+wl&+Wa&+ww &+Lmarks. Upon
&+Lcloser inspection one would notice that at each point where the claws entered
&+Lthe stone, the slabs of granite are shattered at that exact point. The
&+Lexamination would lead one to believe that a large beast lurks in the darkness
&+Land that the paths above are the safest way to travel this chasm.&+n

&+WA Discolored Section of the Cavern&n~
&+L   The cavern continues to the east and south. A strange gritty sand partially
&+Lcovers the ground. Small splotches of blood can be seen on the ground. The
&+Lsmall droplets lead toward the wall that stands to the north and then
&+Ldisappear beneath it. Thick cobwebs stretch from the ceiling to the top
&+Lportions of the cavern walls. Small black dots are bundled tightly beneath
&+Llayers of webbing. Indented in the sand are large footprints. The clawed
&+Lmarkings giving indication that a large beast recently travered this spot.
&+LThe wall to the north stands out as one surveys this spot in the cavern. The
&+Lsurface has been smoothed and a large section appears to be a slightly
&+Ldifferent color than the surrounding stone.&n

&+rThe Bottom of a Great Spire&n~
&+L   Rising from the floor of this rocky cavern is a great stone spire. The
&+Lspire standing firmer than any castle tower imaginable on the surface world.
&+LThe spire in contrast to the other rocky formations in the outside caverns
&+Ltakes the appearance of dark granite. Inside the rock has been smoothed by
&+Lmagical means and now takes on a mirror like reflective property. Any light
&+Lcast in the area is reflected from the walls and ceiling. The reflected light
&+Lfully illuminates the room. A set of stone stairs in the back wall lead up to

&+Lgranite slates. The diamonds sparkle creating a rainbow effect as the light
&+Lreflects off the walls and floor. Mounted on the side wall is a thick mithril
&+Lbracket. Sitting inside the bracket is a thick wooden torch. The torch burns
&+Lbrightly, its &+Rfl&+Yam&+Res &+Lflickering along the granite walls. Just above the torch
&+Lone notices soot has collected on the granite wall. The soot continues up the
&+Lwall for some distance. As one traces the line with their eyes they notice
&+Lsmall holes in the granite ceiling. The holes allowing the smoke from the
&+Lflame to rise up and out of the large spire.&n

&+WA Lair Littered with Bones&n~
&+L   This small cave opens up to four distinct caverns. The ground is not rocky
&+Llike other portions of the chasm just traveled, but rather it is filled with
&+La soft gritty sand. The sand is a brownish color with splotches of dark red. A
&+Lgreen algae grows along the walls feeding on the moisture held within the
&+Lrocks. The algae emits a soft reddish hue as it absorbs the rocks moisture.
&+LThe illumination is barely enough for one to see the cavern in its entirety,
&+Lbut it does provide enough light by which to gauge the surroundings for at
&+Lleast a couple of paces to the front. As one walks around this cave they
&+Lnotice fragmets of &+Wbone &+Llying atop the brown sand. In those areas where the
&+Lsand has taken a dark red color, whole skeletal torsos are visible. One
&+Lquickly realizes that the sands discoloration is due to the &+rblood &+Land gore
&+Lleft as some unknown horror fed on this unfortunate being.&n

&+Ljudge exactly where the bones start and where the wall begins. The center of
&+Lthe cave is cleared of debris allowing the beast that occupies this lair ample
&+Lroom by which to move. The dried &+Rg&+ro&+Rr&+re &+Lfrom its victims litters the sandy
&+Lfloor. The gore and body matter having turned a pale black color. A petrid
&+Lstench rises from the ground and mixes with the moist air that circulates
&+Labout the cavern. The stench seemingly sticks to ones body as the moisture
&+Lcovers any who enter the room. Noticeable in the sandy depressions of the
&+Lcaverns floor is a dark red liquid. The liquid obviously blood from a recent
&+Lkill that now drains to the very center of the room.&n

&+LA Large &+yStone &+LLair&n~
&+L   The floor of this massive cavern is covered in sand. The brown &+ysand &+Lwould
&+Lappear as though it came from near an ocean, however there are chunks of rock
&+Lscattered about the room. The rocks appear to have been eaten and the dust
&+Lspit out to create the covering on the floor that is now visible. A large
&+Lslab of stone with a flat surface sits in the center of the lair. A large
&+Lround stone, hollowed in its center and shaped like a bowl, sits near the
&+Lslab. Piled about the slab are the rotting carcasses of seemingly every race
&+Lon Duris. They are piled atop each other as though discarded after serving
&+Ltheir purpose. Sitting atop the flat slab is the remains of an &+celf&+L. Its center
&+Ltorso ripped apart exposing its entrails, which have been stretched out and
&+Lnow hang to the sandy floor. Pools of blood collect at the base of the slab.
&+LThe &+rblood &+Lmixing with the sand to create a thick syrup of gore and flesh.&n

&+ycast by numerous torches burning from metal brackets along the wall. Small
&+yalcoves are carved into the wall. Small stone idols sit securely within the

&+rBefore a Series of Catacombs&n~
&+L   The path one now walks twists and turns through a desolate cavern. Along
&+Lboth sides of the path sheer walls of stone rise up from the ground to the
&+Lceiling. As one glances at the contour of the walls they notice thin ledges.
&+LThe ledges extend slightly from the mouths of large caves. A sense of awe
&+Lovercomes one as they realize there are literally hundreds of caves filling
&+Lthis cavern. Small indentions in the stone wall provide one the ability to
&+Lscale to the next ledge that rests just slightly over their head. Small
&+Lbrackets are mounted into the walls. The scorched rock just behind the
&+Lbrackets would indicate that at one time the cavern was well lit, however now
&+Lit is silenced in darkness. The path twists and turns through the cavern. The
&+Lconstant weaving pattern making it difficult to make out what may lie just
&+Lahead in the darkness. One thing is for certain and that is not alone in this
&+Lvast cavern. For ever so often, small pebbles fall from the ledges above. The
&+Lpebbles followed by a thin trail of dust indicating something stalks the
&+Ldarkness.&n

&+yit now has a glossy shine. Two torches on either side of the walkway cast a
&+ybright light along the corridor. The torchlight grows bighter as it reflects
&+yfrom the shiny surface of the walls. A small basin stands atop a single pillar
&+yof rock. Water pours forth from a small hole within the wall filling a large
&+ystone bowl that sits along the floor. Small holes within the floor allow
&+ywhatever amount of water that falls to the floor to drain safely away.&n

&+LTravelling through a Well Carved Passageway&n~
&+y   One quickly realizes that the Temple of the Earth is a naturally formed
&+ylava tube. Formed centries ago as Duris breathed its first life onto the
&+ysurface world, deep within her bowels an unspoken and unknown magic was
&+yreleased. Dwelling here through the centuries, this magic has manifested
&+yitself into the most rightous of priests. Now, keeping true to the formations
&+yof the temple, only minor changes have been allowed to the surrounding rock
&+yand stalagmites. This wide tube appears large enough to allow two large Pechs
&+yto walk abreast. Hanging directly in the center of the ceiling is a small ball
&+yof faerie fire. The magical enchantment providing enough light by which to
&+ynavigate the twists and turns of the tunnel, but also leaving some areas
&+yconcealed in shadows.&n

&+LA Secret Chamber within the Temple&n~
&+y   This small chamber appears to be nothing more than a place for one of the
&+yhigh priests to meditate in seclusion. A richly embroidered tapestry hangs
&+yfrom the wall. The tapestry imbued with a magical aura. The colors change and
&+yshift with a rippling effect. The process repeated over and over. A single
&+ytable and chair sits in the room. Numerous books and manuscripts are stacked
&+yneatly atop the table. A single candle sits in a clay holder. At the very tip
&+yof the candle hovers a small ball of faerie fire. The magical enchantment
&+ycasting a dim glow about the room. As one glances at the numerous books and
&+ymanuscripts they realize that this is the chamber of &+CLithibar&+y, grand
&+yillusionist and protector of the abandoned temple.&n

&+y   Created by Lithibar, the high protector, the chasm of illusions stands just
&+ybeyond the doors to the north. This large chamber is one of the last rooms
&+ybefore actually entering the chasm. Large spires run the length of the
&+ychamber.  The spires taking the shape of intricately carved columns. As one
&+ystares at the columns they notice green vines twisting and turning their way
&+yup the large stone structures. The &+gvines &+ycontinue stretching across the great
&+yceiling. They meet in the center in a final embrace before retracting from whence
&+ythey came. The process lasting no more than a few seconds, and leaves one
&+ywondering if the activity actually took place, or was a mere illusion. To
&+ythe north stands a large double door.&n

&+L   A narrow stone bridge leads over an immense crevice. As one peers down into
&+Lthe darkness just below their feet, they realize they are gazing down into the
&+Luntold depths of &+yDuris&+L. A thin &+rred stream &+Lis visible snaking its away
&+Lalong at the bottom of the crevice. The heat rising from this natural rock
&+Lformation would indicate that the core of the realms lies hundreds of feet
&+Lbelow. Jagged rocks protrude from the side of the rocky cliffs like
&+Loutstretched claws. If one should happen to fall, and escaped being impaled by
&+Lthe twisted rocks, they would have little hope of suviving the molten lava
&+Lthat awaits any unfortunate enough to land at the bottom of the chasm.&n

&+Ldead end. It is difficult to determine exactly how the passageway turns out
&+Ldue to the constant twists in direction. The only way to be sure is to walk
&+Lits length. Large rock formations border both sides of the path. The
&+Lformations shaped as though a sculpture crafted them from a wad of clay. In
&+Lsome areas one must climb under the formations for their tops have tumbled

&+Lbeen crafted from pure mithril. The metal bars cast a dim glow about the
&+Lcavern. As one examines the cage they realize that its size would prevent it
&+Lfrom capturing any of the humoind races since they could easily slip in and
&+Lout of the spaces between the bars. Thick spikes at the base of the cage have
&+Lfully imbedded themselves in the stone floor. That, coupled with the enormous
&+Lsize of the cage leads one to believe that a much larger prey is at large.&n

&+yStanding Before an &+cIron &+yCage&n~
&+L   The passageway abrubtly ends here. A thick cage extends from the ceiling
&+Lto the floor. The cage completely covers the entrance to the cavern just to
&+Lthe west. The bars of the cage appear to be mithril. The metal casting a dim
&+Lglow about the cavern. As one looks about their immediate surroundings it
&+Lappears as though the cage was dropped from the ceiling in an attempt to
&+Lcapture something. Thick spikes at the base of the cage are fully imbedded in
&+Lthe stone floor. The size of the cage would lead one to believe that the
&+Lintent was not to capture a humanoid, but rather something much larger.&n

&+rA Narrow Passageway&n~
&+L   This wide passageway twists and turns its way through the cavern. A small
&+Lamount of water covers the floor. The rocky floor of this passageway is
&+Lslightly inclines, forcing the water to un off into the cavern just to the
&+Least. As one gazes further up the passageway they can see the point where
&+Lthe water has reached and has stopped rising. Engraved on the walls to this
&+Lpassageway are cryptic runes. A small amount of energy can be seen running
&+Lthrough the runes. The energy vibrates upon completion bathing the room in a
&+Lpleasant glow of warmth. Once the cycle is complete a new pulse of energy
&+Lmakes its way through the engravings.&n

&+rBefore a Blocked Passageway&n~
&+L   Thick iron bars block further passage to the north. The bars appear to be
&+Lof a high grade mithril for the slightest amount of light is amplified and
&+Lreflected giving the appearance that the bars are imbued with a magical spell.
&+LUpon further inspection one notices that thick &+rspikes &+Lprotrude from the
&+Lopposite side of the bars. Sharp barbs run the length of the spikes and
&+Lappear to have been coated with a black poison. The thickness of the bars and
&+Lthe manner in which the spikes point to deeper within the cavern leave one
&+Lfeeling as though they are approaching an unknown &+revil&+L. Whomever built these
&+Lbars was not worried about protecting a treasure, or keeping wanderers out of
&+Lthe area, but rather keeping something confined to within the cavern in which
&+Lone now faces. Glowing &+Lstalagmites within the tunnel cast a dim light
about the area.&n

&+rA &+BW&+Cat&+Ber &+rFilled Cavern&n~
&+L   Tall stalagmites rise from the ground in large columns. The base of these
&+Lancient and strange rock formations are as large as a wagons wheel. The
&+Lcolumns taper to thin, sharp points as the stalagmites reach the rocky ceiling
&+Labove. As one gazes about this cavern and at the numerous rock formations they
&+Lfeel as though having been swallowed by some great beast. The strange rock
&+Lformations resembling teeth that are devouring all whom enter the cavern. A
&+Lthin film of algae grows along the rocky floor and spreads up to about half
&+Lthe height of the cavern walls. The algae feeding and thriving off the
&+Lmoisture that falls from the cavern ceiling. Small indentions are visible
&+Lalong the floors in those areas where the water constantly falls. The small
&+Lpuddles as the water fills up the natural indentions, spills over onto the
&+Lfloor itself with each new droplet striking the already stagnate water. The
&+Lcavern path remains drenched and slippery as ones footing is constantly being
&+Ltested. One false step could send one tumbling toward the nearest stalagcite,
&+Lpossibly impaling them on the thick and pointed rock formations.&n

&+rA &+BW&+Cat&+Ber &+rFilled Cavern&n~
&+L   This small cave opens up to two distinct caverns. The ground is covered in
&+La small amount of water. The water running in from the cave to the east as
&+Lwell as dripping from the ceiling above. Those portions of the chamber not
&+Lflooded are covered with a soft gritty sand. The sand is a brownish color with
&+Lsplotches of dark red. A green algae grows along the walls feeding on the
&+Lmoisture held within the rocks as well as the water that drips slowly from the
&+Lceiling. The algae emits a soft reddish hue as it absorbs the rocks moisture.
&+LThe illumination is barely enough for one to see the cavern in its entirety,
&+Lbut it does provide enough light by which to gauge the surroundings for at
&+Lleast a couple of paces to the front. As one walks around this cave they
&+Lnotice fragmets of bone lying atop the brown sand. In those areas where the
&+Lsand has taken a dark red color, whole skeletal torsos are visible. One
&+Lquickly realizes that the sands discoloration is due to the blood and gore
&+Lleft as some unknown horror fed on this being that wandered unsuspectingly
&+Linto the lair of the &+CHydra&+L.&n

&+rA Water Filled Cavern&n~
&+L   This small cave opens up from the main chamber to the west. Barely visible
&+Lat the back of the room is a small opening. The opening sits at the point
&+Lwhere the cave walls meet the floor. Rushing in from this opening is &+Bwa&+Cte&+Br&n
&+Lfrom a stream within the rocks. The sound barely audible from the wind that
&+Lwhistles past ones ears. A few rocks jut from the ground creating a current
&+Lthat tugs at ones foot. The skeletal remains of duergar and elves, having been
&+Lswept in by the current, lie wedged against one of the larger rocks. The
&+Lskeletal remains forming a gruesome dam that causes the water to stagnate at
&+Lthat point before flowing out of the alcove and into the larger chamber.&n

&+rWalking Over a &+yStone &+rBridge&n~
&+L   A narrow stone walkway stands suspended above the water by just a daggers
&+Llength. As one walks to the center of the stone bridge and gazes about, they
&+Lnotice that small cave-like structures branch off from this central cavern.
&+LThe water remains constant and would appear to have flooded all the chambers
&+Lwithin sight. Luckily, the water is but a few depths deep and can easily be
&+Ltrodded through. In certain areas it is obvious that a slight current exists
&+Las small patches of green mold swiftly float into one of the four chambers.
&+LThe current created as the water flows over deep cracks and holes within the
&+Lcavern floor. An uneasy feeling overcomes one as they realize that one unlucky
&+Lstep could send them falling into the deepest and darkest depths of the
&+Lunderdark.&n

&+Lappears to be receding to the caverns in the south. As the water recedes a
&+Lgrisly sight is left to behold. Ro&+rtt&+Led torsos liter the cavern floor. The
&+Lsalty water having mumified what little flesh remained on the bodies. The
&+Lrotted corpses now sit upright as though beckoning one to leave the lair
&+Limmediately. The corpses have taken on a pale gray color due to the salt
&+Lwater preserving their molded flesh. A petrid stench wafts in the air. The
&+Lonly reprise coming as the wind in the cavern shifts blowing the stench
&+Lin another direction. The short lived wind dies out quickly and ones senses
&+Lare overwhelmed as the stench of &+Wd&+we&+Wc&+wa&+Wy &+Lquickly fills the lair.&n

&+Lrise up in revolt to that in which they now stand. Mummified corpses litter
&+Lthe room. The mangled torsos thrown about like small dolls. The thin amount
&+Lof water that covers the floor has turned a pungent reddish brown. The blood
&+Lhaving been so thick in the room that the rocks along the floor are now red as
&+Lwell. Small black beetles scitter across the gore soaked water. The beetles
&+Lfeasting on whatever pieces of flesh are still visible on the skeletal
&+Lremains of the hapless victims.&n

&+Lguided by long tentacles that protrude from their foreheads. Growing along
&+Lthe rocky wall just a few inches above the water line is a thick green mold.
&+LSmall brown roots are visible growing from the mold and dangling like small

&+yVisible in the center of the door is what appears to be clawed marks. The
&+ymarks extend outward as though some great beast attempted to dislodge the
&+ydoor from the otherside. An iron slab hangs to about the center of the door.
&+yA runed inscription has been intricately etched into the slab. Mounted on the

&+Lwall and it appears as though the passageway simply lead one to the caverns
&+Ledge and a dead end. Running from the ceiling to the floor is a narrow crack
&+Lin the rock. As one peers through the crack they notice that walking through
&+Lone would soon come to an immense cavern. The crack is barely wide enough to
&+Lallow one to walk straight and instead any who pass through must turn to their
&+Lsides in order to pass. Thick stalagmites extend from the ceiling. The rocky
&+Lformations giving the appearance that one is entering the mouth of some beast.
&+LThe different colored rocks visible deeper within the crevice cast a purplish
&+Lhue throughout the area. The eerie color adding to the feeling that all is not
&+Las it seems within this immense cavern of rock and sand.&n

&+Ltransformed this small cave into a command post. A large slab of granite sits
&+Lin the middle of the room. The surface has been chiseled flat and is now used
&+Las a makeshift table. Large stones have been rolled into the room. A large
&+Lsection was chiseled out of the stones to create makeshift chairs. Mounted
&+Lalong the walls are weapon racks. Swords and battle-axes of various sizes
&+Lrest in thier specific grooves, waiting to be brought to bear on any who
&+Lshould trespass through this section of the tunnel. A large map is sketched

&+Lmassive lair. Water stands about a foot deep over the main portions of the
&+Lfloor. Large stones jut forth from the floor and it appears that the only way
&+Lto keep out of the water would be to jump from stone to stone. A heavy stench
&+Llingers in the air. The smell enough to make even the vilest of creatures
&+Ldrop to their knees and gag for floating atop the &+Bw&+Cat&+Ber &+Lare hundreds of
&+Lcorpses. A majority of the corpses are decapitated. The jugulars spilling
&+Lforth their life force, turning the water a deep crimson color. The gruesome
&+Lsight of the headless corpses floating about is in no comparison to the
&+Lheads that float nearby. The skin stretched tight across their cheekbones, the
&+Leyes having taken on a milky white color. The faces frozen to their last
&+Lexpression...that of complete and utter &+rhorror&+L.&n

&+mThe Entrance to an Abandoned Temple&n~
&+L   Seemingly cut from the walls of this great cavern, one now stands before a
&+Llarge temple. Tall spires of stone flank the entranceway to a large granite
&+Ldoor. The spires that flank the door rise from the cavern floor twisting their
&+Lway to the ceiling high above. A platform is visible extending from the spires
&+Land stretching to the center of the cavern. Standing at this position the
&+Lplatforms appear to be a walkway that at one point would allow guards or
&+Larchers to defend any who try to invade the temple. Thick mithril rings are
&+Lbolted into each of the granite doors. Wrapped around each of the rings is a
&+Llarge chain. The chain extends from the doors and rises to the ceiling where
&+Lit connects to a large &+ywheel&+L. The chains loop around the wheel and travel the
&+Lwall where they are connected to a gold lever that is barely visible on the
&+Lside wall. One would assume that pulling the lever would initiate a locking
&+Lmechanism that opens the door.&n

&+mInside an Abandoned Temple&n~
&+L   Once a great hall that served as a gathering place for those races of
&+LDuris that worshipped the stone gods, this hall is now littered in rubble.
&+LTremors from deep within the underdark have caused sections of the temple to
&+Lcollapse. From those sections that still stand, it is easy for one to tell
&+Lthat this hall was once lavishly decorated. Along both sides of the room stood
&+Llarge statues. A few of the statues still stands while others have toppled to
&+Lthe ground. The ones that fell lie scattered along the floor as their stone
&+Lmoldings shattered on impact. Those statues that still remain depict large
&+Lstone golems wielding huge clubs. The warrior golems are in various stages of
&+La battle stance and stand ready to guard the temple should the proper
&+Lincantation be spoken. Torn tapestries hang from narrow poles that are mounted
&+Lin the walls. The tapestries appear to have once been flags, maybe to give
&+Lhonor to specific races, but are now nothing more than dust covered rags.&n

&+mA Small Chamber Within the Temple&n~
&+L   Opening up from the side passage is this small alcove. Large stone benches
&+Lrun along both sides of the room. The benches all face the northern section
&+Lof the room. Standing at the north side of the room is a large stone statue.
&+LIt's outstretched hands cradling a large round sphere. It's head is uplifted
&+Las though gazing into the heavens. The figure is draped in what appears to be
&+La robe. The &+yrock &+Lwhich was chiseled thin to replicate fabric has been chipped
&+Land cracked and now gives the statues a rundown appearance. The walls that
&+Lborder this room were once decorated with lavish carvings. The carvings now
&+Lcracked and worn and it is difficult to make out what meaning they once
&+Lrepresented. A few &+Wr&+wu&+Wn&+we&+Ws &+Lcan be seen engraved on the side wall nearest the
&+Lstatue. The lettering appears to be nothing more than a long forgotten
&+rscripture&+L.&n

&+mA Hallway Within the Temple&n~
&+L   Piles of rubble litter the floor making it difficult for one to move
&+Lfurther into the temple. The large rocks and other debris appear to have been
&+Lstacked to the side of the hall. Footprints barely covered by the settling
&+Ldust can be seen in the center of the hall indicating that something was
&+Lrecently in the area. Small metal brackets are visible along the walls. The
&+Lscorched stone directly behind the brackets would indicate that at one time
&+Ltorches burned along the walls illuminating the passageway.&n

&+LA &+wB&+Wo&+wn&+We &+LLittered Lair&n~
&+L   Rotted carcasses litter the sandy floor of this large lair. The skeletal
&+Lremains appear to be stripped of &+yfl&+res&+yh&+L, then tossed to the four corners of the
&+Llair. Along the sheer walls of this cavern are three ledges. Behind the ledges
&+Lone can see the openings of small caves. Red &+Reyes &+Lpeer out from the darkness.
&+LThe eyes moving about and one feels as though the beasts that lurk above are
&+Lwaiting for the opportune moment to strike. Crimson pools of sand splatter
&+Lthe floor. The red pools heaviest under the freshest piles of corpses. A
&+Lpungent smell lingers about the area. The stench strong enough to force one to
&+Ltheir knees in an attempt to purge the contents of their stomach. Two small
&+Lalcoves are visible to the north and south. The openings to those caverns are
&+Lmuch smaller than the main entrance. The smaller alcoves providing a safe
&+Lplace for the younger beasts to feast on whatever carcass they can find.&n

&+Lcarcasses and body parts they can pull in from the main lair. The ground is
&+Lcovered in a white powder that sits atop the brown sand. Visible in the sand
&+Lare hundreds of clawed prints and grooves. The grooves created as portions of

&+mAn Abandoned Library&n~
&+L   This large oval room once served as the main library for the origianl
&+Ltemple. For some unknown reason when this section was vacated, none of the
&+Lbooks were removed. Sitting in the center of the room is a large circular
&+Lstone table. Lying in crumbled heaps of stone on the floor are the remnants of
&+Lthe chairs that once sat beside the table. Numerous parchments lie scattered
&+Labout the table along with books pulled from the shelves that run along the
&+Lwalls. As one stands and looks about the room they get the impression that
&+Lsomeone was recently in the room searching for something. The large &+yleather&+L
&+Lparchments that lie on the table appear to be maps of the temple. The books
&+Lthat are still open on the table are turned to pages that depict cavernous
&+Lmaps. Once could only assume that something lies hidden within the temple. Its
&+Lsecrets lost through the centuries, however the key to unlocking the unknown
&+Lmystery lies somewhere in this room.&n

&+mA Secret Chamber Beneath the Library&n~
&+L   This small chamber lies concealed behind a false panel in the main library.
&+LA single table and chair sits in the far corner of the room. Standing atop the
&+Ltable is a brass lantern. The bottom section of the lantern is filled with a
&+Lyellow oil that fuels the wick. The small &+Yf&+Rla&+Ym&+Re &+Lthat burns provides enough
&+Llight by which to illuminate the room. Numerous shelves are mounted into the
&+Lside wall. The shelves run from just above the floor to the ceiling of this
&+Lsmall chamber. Numerous volumes of books line the shelves. Oddly enough, a few
&+Lof the books, on different shelves, look as though they have been pulled out
&+Land now protrude from the edge of the shelf.&n

&+Lfloor slopes slightly upward bringing any who travel here out of the
&+Lgruesome water. The rocks surrounding the slight incline are all colored a
&+Ldeep red. The blood having soaked into the rocks cavity. Chucnks of flesh
&+Lfloat atop the water. The flesh being pushed by the currents until it comes
&+Lto rest on the rocky slope. Skeletal remains are visible on a few of the
&+Llarger rocks. The flesh, having been out of the salty water, has decomposed

&+Lwest of the main lair. Small rocks rise up from the gore infested water. The
&+Lrocks having turned a dark red color from the &+rblood &+Lthat covers the cavern
&+Lfloor. After a slight slope the cavern floor levels off and appears to be
&+Lfree of rocks. Visible on the flat portions of the cavern floor are what
&+Lappears to be rags of &+yleather &+Lclothing. The rags have been shredded by claws
&+Lor teeth and now lie in circles along the ground. It becomes obvious that
&+Lone has entered the nesting ground of the Hydra's. Small white eggs&n
&+Lspeckled with red dots are visible safely secured within the bundle of
&+Lshredded leather. One becomes more cautious as they realize that a

&+rA Nesting Grounds Within the Lair&n~
&+L   The ground slopes slightly upward as one enters this small alcove to the
&+Lwest of the main lair. Small rocks rise up from the gore infested water. The
&+Lrocks having turned a dark red color from the blood that covers the cavern
&+Lfloor. After a slight slope the cavern floor levels off and appears to be
&+Lfree of rocks. Visible on the flat portions of the cavern floor are what
&+Lappears to be rags of leather clothing. The rags have been shredded by claws
&+Lor teeth and now lie in circles along the ground. It becomes obvious that
&+Lone has entered the nesting ground of the Hydra's. Small white &+Weggs&+L
&+Lspeckled with red dots are visible safely secured within the bundle of
&+Lshredded &+yleather&+L. One becomes more cautious as they realize that a
&+Lprotective female Hydra lurks nearby in the darkness.&n

&+mA Large Cathedral Within the Temple&n~
&+L   The room opens up into what was once a grand cathedral. The tiled granite
&+Lslate intricately molded into the ceiling giving it the appearance of a
&+Lshingled room. In the very center on the domed ceiling is a large diamond
&+Lfixture. The handsomely crafted chandelier hangs suspended by a thin gold
&+Lwire. The diamonds are all cut into sharp angles that twists any light that
&+Lenters the room casting a prismatic effect along the floor. Stone pews line
&+Lboth sides of the cathedral. The pews are all facing west toward a large
&+Laltar. A single statue stands at the head of the cathedral. This once perfect
&+Lsculpture now beginning to show signs of wear as one can see cracks in the
&+Lbody even at this distance.&n

&+mA Passageway Within the Temple&n~
&+L   Breaking off from the Cathedral to the east, this small passageway leads
&+Lfurther into the abandoned temple. Its once lavish decor now rotted. The
&+Csilk &+Ltapestries, an indication of the temples grandeur, lie shredded
&+Lalong the floor. A few pieces of the rags still hang from the walls. The
&+Lmaterial thin enough so that the slightest of breezes would turn it to dust,

&+Lalong the floor are large footprints. The constant treading leaving little
&+Lindication of tracks, but rather causing them to look as though a large
&+Lsnake slithered through the area.&n

&+mA Secret Chamber Beneath the Library&n~
&+L   Used by the elite high priests, before their banishment, this small room
&+Lheld the great books of summoning. An ancient art used to bring forth the
&+Lvilest of creatures from the plane of &+Ye&+yart&+Yh&+L. Often the summoning was distorted
&+Land the creatures that were brought forth to this plane of existence became
&+Ltormented. Their anger turning to a &+Rb&+rloodlus&+Rt &+Ldriving them to kill their
&+Lsummoner and return to their plane of existence. Even though the magic was
&+Lforbidden, this small room held the books defining the art of summoning. An
&+Lunseen force can be felt thriving in the room. As one stands here looking at
&+Lthe numerous books sitting haplessly on the shelf, an aura radiates from the
&+Lroom. An aura of guilt and despair as if a force is attempting to summon a
&+Lcursed creature from the abyss.&n

&+L   Suspended upside down from thick &+cchains &+Lthat fall from the ceiling are
&+Lthe dead bodies of robed priests. The necks of each priests has been sliced
&+Lopen right at the jugular vein. The blood that flowed to the floor stained the
&+Lskin a brownish-red color. A few of the bodies still sway against the chains.
&+LThe movement causing an eerie creaking sound as the chain rubs against the
&+Lstone beam suspended just overhead. The hands of a few of the taller priests
&+Lactually hang to the floor. The skin on the knuckles having been rubbed
&+Laway as the body twisted at the end of the chain. Small grooves along the
&+Lfloor intesect to create a rune. The blood that flowed from the priests
&+Lcollected in the &+rrune &+Lturning the stone a bright red. The fresh blood that
&+Lstill sits within the crevices of the rune appears to flow by some unknown
&+Lmagic. A dim light pulsates from the center of the rune giving indicaion that

&+mA Secret Chamber Within the Library&n~
&+L   Tucked securely behind a false bookshelf, this small chamber is packed with
&+Lunholy relics. A large slab of granite sits in the very center of the room.
&+LThin leather straps with small metal hooks are bolted into the granite rock.
&+LSitting atop the smooth slab is the skeletal remains of a drow. The metal
&+Lhooks in the leather strap held the unfortunate &+mdrow&+L in place as his body
&+Lwas ruthlesly tortured in an attempt to gain additional knowledge on spells
&+Lof summoning. &+yWooden &+Lshelves line the wall of the room. The jars and bottles
&+Lthat sit atop the shelves contain embalmed body parts from a variety of races.
&+LThe largest jars containing the decapitated heads of almost every race on
&+LDuris. The frozen faces allowing one a glimpse into the pain and despair
&+Lthe unfortunate victim felt just prior to death. One would think that death
&+Lwould be a release from the inflicted pain, however, on second thought being
&+Ltrapped in these jars for eternity is the worst torture yet.&n

&+LThe passageway appears to take numerous twists and turns. Thick pointed rocks
&+Lextend from the floor creating easily avoided obstacles that one must
&+Lnavigate as they continue travel. A slight breeze can be felt coming from the
&+Lopposite end of the passageway. The breeze smells slightly of salted water
&+Lleading one to believe that perhaps they are approaching the ocean.&n

&+Lpriests that attend the temple of the earth. The dead priests all face
&+Ldown toward the floor. Their swollen &+rtongues &+Lhanging from their rotted mouths.
&+LTheir eyes having turned the pale blue color of death now stare back with the
&+Lvacant expression of &+Wd&+we&+Wa&+wt&+Wh&+L. A few of the slippers have fallen off the feet of
&+Lthose priests that kicked their legs as they were being pulled up to their
&+Ldeaths. The toenails of those priests are colored a dark black...a stark

&+L   This large chamber serves as the staging area for the protectors of the
&+Ltemple. Often dispatched in small patrols, they wander the temple ensuring
&+Lthat no outsiders have breached its walls. Over the course of the centuries
&+La number of raiders and thieves have seeked the abandoned temple. It is
&+Lrumored that during the early centuries of Duris, a band of high priests
&+Lseeking wealth opened a portal to another realm. Now, the temple lies in ruins
&+Lhidden deep within one of the numerous caverns that stretch throughout the
&+Lmountain. A large &+ywooden &+Ltable sits in the center of the room. Six chairs sit
&+Lneatly pushed against the table. Scrolled out and held by four daggers in each
&+Lof its corners is a large map.&n

&+LAlong the ceiling are panels of black granite. The hard rock having been
&+Lsmoothed and polished so that it has a mirror-like reflective quality. The
&+Lwooden torches that burn along the sanctuaries walls reflect from the granite
&+Lceiling casting a bright light about the area. Stone statues line the walls
&+Lof the room. The statues are primarily of half-elves, but strangely enough a
&+Lend of the room. The altar appears to be made of gold for its bright yellow
&+Lcolor gleams lik a diamond in the night. The altar is raised about three feet
&+Lor so from the floor and has a ledge where one could walk out to address those
&+Lassembled here for the sermon.&n

&+Lforming strange symbols that continue to pulsate. The dim light cast from the
&+Lrunes bathes the area in a slight glow. There are numerous wooden chairs
&+Lwithin the room. Each covered with a richly embroidered pillow for comfort. A
&+Lsingle lamp sitting atop a small &+ytable&+L, unlit, would appear to be the only
&+Llight provided as its occupant read the parchments also sitting atop the

&+Lsmaller rooms used by the priests and acolytes. Fine paintings along the
&+Lwalls show scenes of relative peace at a time when Duris was not ruled
&+Land divided by war. Grey elves and orcs, both devoted to the spells of the
&+Learth, are depicted casting magics and working hand in hand. Drow and grey
&+Lelves both are depicted dancing beneath the stars, the only light being that
&+Lof the moon and the small log &+Rf&+Yi&+Rr&+re &+Lthat burns in the center of the spectacle.&n

&+Lthe cathedral. The tunnel one now travels appears to be carved through thick
&+Lslabs of hard granite. The grey rock showing slight slivers of gold that run
&+Lvertically through the passage. A few paintings are visible along the walls.
&+LThe paintings not done on a canvas or other backing, but rather painted on the
&+Lwalls themselves. The scenes, unlike those in other sections of the temple
&+Lare of warring factions. Armies of elves along with their summoned elementals
&+Lare fighting orcs and other beings allied with pechs and slyphs. The scenes of
&+Lcarnage are quite graphic and one could only assume that the painter was there
&+Lduring these great battles, their memory forever in its mind.&n

&+yA large metal plate sits in the center of the doors. The plate appearing to
&+ybe some sort of locking mechanism. A small diamond shaped hole in the center
&+yof the plate providing the keyhole to unlock the doors. The entranceway is
&+yslightly recessed from the main passageway. Along both sides are statues of
&+yhuge stone golems. The golems resembling Ogres in their size and ferocity.
&+yEach golem is equiped with a huge granite club, held over its head as if
&+yprepared to deliver a killing blow for whomever approached the chamber of the

&+ystone fountain sculpted in the shape of a stone giant. The single club
&+ywielded in the giants right hand is raised over its head. The fierce look in
&+yits eyes giving one the impression that the giant is about to deliver a
&+ykilling blow to its unseen foe. Pulsating in the very center of the ceiling
&+yis a small ball of faerie fire. The glow bathing the room in an eerie array of
&+yshadows that dance as though a flickering flame was located nearby.&n

&+yslabs of stone. The way the wood is bolted to the granite, the desk would
&+yappear to be able to withstand the forced weight of a giant upon its legs. A
&+ythin drawer is visible on the oposite side of the desk. The drawer is slightly
&+yajar providing easy access for one to search its contents. Plainly visible in
&+ythe ajar drawer is a small purple vial. A few parchments lie scattered about
&+ythe floor. The parchments, coupled with the spilled container of ink atop the
&+ydesk would leave one to believe that the room was recently searched. The

&+ywithin the lantern providing enough light by which the priests can read or
&+ywrite their incantations before going to sleep. Fine paintings line the walls.
&+yThe paintings depict scenes of warfare and strife, a stark reminder of the
&+ysolitude to which they commit themsleves, shunning any from the outside world
&+ythat attempt to gather the collected secrets of the Temple of the Earth. The
&+ysecrets collected and safeguarded for centuries within this very domain.&n

&+yclouds that hover in the darkness above. A fierce wind blows through the area,
&+ythe sound emanating from the surrounding structures making it sound as
&+ypiercing as a banshees wail. With each gust small pebbles are picked up by the
&+yair and sent to pummel ones body. The sand and pebbles picked up by the wind
&+ystrike the surrounding cliffs with dull thuds. The constant impact of the
&+ysmall rocks make it sound as though a battle is being waged just beyond the
&+ynext spire. One gathers glimpses of the area beyond as the dense clouds of
&+ydust are scattered by the howling wind. The abyss continues to what seems
&+yforever. The tall rocky spires, yellow and brown in appearance, rise from the
&+ydust below and travel to beyond the dusty sky. Their warped shapes looking as
&+ythough an ancient elm, twisted and defiled like a skeletal hand.&n

&+Lthe bloodrune. As one surveys the area they realize that the patrol leader
&+Lleft a majority of his troops that were inexperienced behind. The camp is in
&+La sad state of repair and could easily be overun. A few duergar guards can
&+Lbe seen in the distance. The guards being apart of a reconnaissance patrol to
&+Lensure none of the elementals that roam the abyss breach their perimeter.&n

&+LFloating Through a Rocky Abyss&n~
&+y   Large columns of stone rise up from a bottomless pit of swirling dust and
&+ydebris. The columns stretch up until their tips disappear into the dusty
&+yclouds that hover in the darkness above. A fierce wind blows through the area,
&+ythe sound emanating from the surrounding structures making it sound as
&+ypiercing as a banshees wail. With each gust small pebbles are picked up by the
&+yair and sent to pummel ones body. The sand and pebbles picked up by the wind
&+ystrike the surrounding cliffs with dull thuds. The constant impact of the
&+ysmall rocks make it sound as though a battle is being waged just beyond the
&+ynext spire. One gathers glimpses of the area beyond as the dense clouds of
&+ydust are scattered by the howling wind. The abyss continues to what seems
&+yforever. The tall rocky spires, yellow and brown in appearance, rise from the
&+ydust below and travel to beyond the dusty sky. Their warped shapes looking as
&+ythough an ancient elm, twisted and defiled like a skeletal hand.&n

&+LA &+WPaladin &+LEncampment Along the Abyss&n~
&+L   Rising up from the center of a large boulder is what appears to be a
&+Lpaladin encampment. Numerous tents line the surface of the flat sections of
&+Lthe rock. The tents are all positioned in a semi-circle so as to allow the
&+Lmaximum amount of movement should the encampment come under attack. Small
&+Lburms litter the outskirts of the camp. A few paladin warriors can be seen
&+Lcrouched behind the tall embankments. The warriors often rise up to survey the
&+Lsurounding abyss before sitting back down behind the natural protection of the
&+Lburm. A large fire burns heavily in the center of the tents. The fire used as
&+Lboth a light source and a means by which to cook the nights meal.&n

&+y   Large columns of stone rise up from a bottomless pit of swirling dust and
&+ydebris. The columns stretch up until their tips disappear into the dusty
&+yclouds that hover in the darkness above. A fierce wind blows through the area,
&+ythe sound emanating from the surrounding structures making it sound as
&+ypiercing as a banshees wail. With each gust small pebbles are picked up by the
&+yair and sent to pummel ones body. The sand and pebbles picked up by the wind
&+ystrike the surrounding cliffs with dull thuds. The constant impact of the
&+ysmall rocks make it sound as though a battle is being waged just beyond the
&+ynext spire. One gathers glimpses of the area beyond as the dense clouds of
&+ydust are scattered by the howling wind. The abyss continues to what seems
&+yforever. The tall rocky spires, yellow and brown in appearance, rise from the
&+ydust below and travel to beyond the dusty sky. Their warped shapes looking as
&+ythough an ancient elm, twisted and defiled like a skeletal hand.&n

&+LFloating Through a Rocky Abyss&n~
&+y   Swirls of dust blow through this vast abyss like the flames shooting from a
&+ydragons mouth. The small pebbles that have been picked up from the almost
&+yconstant blowing of wind strike all in its path. The constant howl of the wind
&+ycoupled with the battering sting of pebbles make one feel as though they are
&+ytraveling through a massive sandstorm. Large boulders float through the abyss
&+yturning and twisting their way as if on some predetermined course. An eerie
&+yaura radiates throughout the area. The aura turning the vast skyline a bright
&+yorange color for an instant then quickly changing to the blackest of nights.
&+yAs the shift in color subsides one notices an almost trance like effect as
&+ythough the abyss senses an unwelcome presence and is simply taking measures to
&+yrid itself of the unwelcomed parasites.&n

&+LA Fortified Landing Within the Abyss&n~
&+y   This large flat rock seemingly floats through the rocky abyss on large
&+yclouds of dust. Visible along the outer perimeter of the rock, construction has
&+ystarted on a makeshift wall. The jagged rocks that comprise the wall are
&+yactually thick slabs of granite. Thin veins of mithril can be seen snaking
&+ytheir way through the rock. The thick deposits of ore cause the boulders of
&+ygranite to emit a small amount of light from their otherwise dark and desolate
&+ycolor. As one surveys the rock they notice numerous fortifications dug into
&+ythe various boulders that protrude from the surface. It appears as though a
&+ysmall army is massing on this single rock preparing to launch an offensive
&+yinto the depths of the rocky abyss.&n

&+y   As one floats through this vast expanse they become overwhelmed at the

&+ylarge rocks that float by twist and turn as though they are on a predetermined

&+ythe area. The storms give away their presence by the screeching hiss as they
&+yravage the area. The clashing of the storms with the rocks make the storms

&+ypicked up and carried with the howling wind.&n

&+LFloating Through a Dusty Abyss~
&+y   As one floats through this vast expanse they become overwhelmed at the
&+yhelpless feeling that overcomes their being. The massive rocks that float
&+yeffortlessly in the air give indication that any who happen to be here are no
&+ylonger part of the mortal realms, but have tranversed into another realm. The
&+ylarge rocks that float by twist and turn as though they are on a predetermined
&+ycourse. As the rocks appear to be about to collide, they quickly altar course
&+yso as to avoid the collision. Large storms of dust and pebbles howl through
&+ythe area. The storms give away their presence by the screeching hiss as they
&+yravage the area. The clashing of the storms with the rocks make the storms
&+ystronger. For as they strike the rocks they dislodge smaller boulders that are
&+ypicked up and carried with the howling wind.&n

&+rStanding Before a Large Fortress&n~
&+L   Floating effortlessly through the sandy abyss of rock and debris stands
&+Lthis large fortress. The fortress is nothing more than a tall spire of solid
&+Lblack rock that rises like a steeple from the very center of the floating
&+Lboulder. The fortress, which resembles a solitary tower, stands at what one
&+Lguess to be over three hundred fathoms high. Crude parapets are visible at the
&+Ltop edge of the tower. A few shapes can be seen moving about which indicate
&+Leither archers or advanced lookouts have been positioned to safeguard the
&+Lentrance. A solid door which is perfectly round blocks the entrance into the
&+Ltower. Mystical &+Cr&+cu&+Cn&+ce&+Cs &+Lare etched along the outer seal of the door. In a few
&+Linstances the runes cross over the threshold and are inscribed on the door
&+Litself. Upon loser examination one would notice that by opening the door the
&+Lrune would be broken.&n

&+rThe Chambers Within the Fortress&n~
&+L   This large chamber is etched with intricate runes. The strange carvings
&+Lrun along the floor and up along all walls until they converge upon the
&+Lceiling. At the exact point where the runes come together a dim light glows
&+Lthat illuminates the chamber. Beyond the shadows one can see the openings to
&+Lother chambers that continue on into the fortress. Along the walls one notices
&+Lthat human skulls have been inset into the walls. In some instances the runes
&+Lapproach the skulls and continue across their foreheads as though the skulls
&+Lnow play a part in the runewriters quest. As one examines the way in which the
&+Lskulls have been positioned, they notice that on each of the foreheads two
&+Lcircular holes are set right above the eye sockets. One could only imagine
&+Lwhat type of beast would penetrate the skill in order to devour the brains of
&+Lthese unfortunate victims.&n

&+rChambers Within the Fortress&n~
&+L   The chambers continue at this point toward the north and east. The large
&+Lchamber in which one now stands is rather uninviting. Small pebbles of rock
&+Lline the floor. Small holes are visible in the walls where the rock has
&+Lcrumbled out. In those sections of the wall where there are no holes, large
&+Lintricate runes have been chiseled into the stone. The strange carvings run
&+Lalong the floor and up along all walls until they converge upon the ceiling.

&+rA Dark Chamber Within the Fortress&n~
&+L   The room takes an almost oblong shape as one enters and begins to move
&+Labout the area. The shape, although odd, appears to maximize the space in
&+Lthis narrow section of the fortress. The walls and floor are comprised of a
&+Lthick rock. The rock resembles granite in appearance and appears to have been
&+Lsmoothed to almost glossy shine. Strangely enough two torches are mounted in
&+Lsmall bronze brackets on opposite walls. The torches were just recently lit as
&+Lthe flame has barely burned any of the bundled tar dipped reed. As one looks
&+Lcloser aout their surroundings they notice that large scrape marks run along
&+Lthe floor. The marks have burroughed about an inch or two into the strong
&+Lstone and would appear to have been created as something sharp dragged across
&+Lthe room.&n

&+YBefore a Huge Stone Door&n~
&+y   This huge stone doors stretches sixteen feet high. Intricate runes are
&+yetched along its border. The runes glow with a magical force. At first
&+yglance one would assume the &+Cr&+cu&+Cn&+ce&+Cs &+yare to keep some beast locked safely
&+ybehind the door. However, as one looks about the ground, they notice
&+ythe flat stone beneath the door has gouge marks created as the door
&+yis opened. Obviously whatever lies behind the door comes and goes a
&+yit sees fit. A single door handle of forged gold appears to be the
&+yonly way to enter the chamber beyond...if one dares.&n
