&+WDead End of a Deep and Narrow Canyon~
&+y   The steep and narrow canyon comes to its end here. High and unclimbable
&+ywalls are barring way in all directions except west. These walls are so steep
&+ythat sun barely bathes canyon floor with its lifegiving radiance. This whole
&+yplace is thus sunk in eternal demishadows.
&+yUnder the yeastern wall, there's some rocky rubble.

&+y   Steep stone walls rise to the west and south from here, blocking way in that

&+Wclearing&+y visible through &+gthe forest&n.

&+GHeart of the Forest~
&+G   This is the very heart of the forest. Long, long time ago, before first man
&+Gplaced his foot in this valley, and even before first man was created at all,
&+Gsome unnamed goddes dropped here a magical grain of sand. That grain wasn't a
&+Gnormal sand grain. It started to grow. It started to spring roots and leaves.
&+GIt became a first tree. Centuries passed, and the single tree given life to all
&+Gthe huge forest. Human race came to the valley, started exploring the forest,
&+Gcutting trees. Still, earthly magic of this place prevents them from gettin any
&+Gcloser to this ancient grove.

&+GLost in a Deep Forest~
&+g   The trees and bushes here grow so dense that its utterly impossible to
&+gcorrectly recognize where is north and where is south. The sun does not
&+gshine through the dense foliage, it`s dark down here. Even the most
&+gexperienced tribal hunters don't hunt in this part of the forest.They're
&+gafraid of getting lost. In the darkness, something moves silently.

&+gThe tree itself grows not in the exact center of the clearing, but slightly

&+gchoosen to spread more to the southeast than to any other directions, it will
&+gmost likely remain an unanswered question. Yet this is the case, as clearing
&+gis just an above-survace manifestation of the net of roots that sucks living
&+gessence from all other plants and transter it to the oaken giant.
