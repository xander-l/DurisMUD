&+mEntrance to Shadamehr Keep&N~
   The keep is a large floating castle, hovering above the ethereal
plane of existence. The keep looks to be a old stronghold of some sort,
with large defending walls, and many holes in the walls for archers to
fire their deadly missiles out of. The keep is made out of some black
stone that has been polished to the point where the keep almost gleams.

&+mInside the Shadamehr Keep&N~
   Inside the shadamehr keep, you can see that this keep once was owned
by a powerfull knight. Many swords and lances, now rusted, hang from the
walls as trophies of battles won. On the walls, you can see the remains of
what appears to be some tapestry, that now hangs by threads to the wall.

&+mA Large Foyer in The Keep&N~
   This foyer is a very large open area that leads off into the
main parts of the keep. The foyers floor is made of a highly
polished black stone, with inlaid gold and silver. On the floor
there is what remains of a large rug, that is now only a heap
of threads. The ceiling is vaulted, a feat of engineering that
is a great sight to behold.

&+mA Entrance Hallway in The Keep&N~
   This hallway leads off into a large, formal hallway to the north. The
gleam of inlaid gold can even be seen from here. A large foyer is off
to the east, the gleam of inlaid gold on the floor and walls can be
seen from even here, but is not quite as brilliant as the hallway to the
north. A small lounge is to the west. The hallway itself is quite elaborate,
and must of meant to dazzle the people who used to come here, for it has
many, now ruined from time, paintings, and tapistrys on the walls.

&+bA Small Lounge in The Keep&N~
   This lounge sits off to the side of a very large, open entrance hallway.
The lounge has two couches, now tattered and frayed from age, off at
opposite sides of the room, and a few chairs here and there. There is a
small shelf of books, that have mostly turned to mush from lack of use.

&+YA Large Formal Hallway&N~
   This hallway has the look of almost being royal. The walls are adorned
with beautiful artifacts from lands unknown. Gold is inlaid into almost
all surfaces, and where it is not inlaid there are paintings and tapistrys,
now piles of dyed thread barely hanging from the walls, and many other items
that you have no clue what are, from them being so worn from age.

&+YA Open Area in a Large Formal Hallway&N~
   This area seems to open up from the almost confined space of the
hallway, to the very open spaces of a semi-foyer. There is a large
ornate door to the north, made out of some unknown metal. This area
has the same formal appearance as the rest of the hallways in the keep.

&+LA Small Darkend Room&N~
   This room is quite black. Nothing can be made out, accept for the
shadows which seem to be moving around you, as if to encircle you and
devour you alive. The room has a very rank scent, as if something had
been living in here for many years.

&+rA Oddly Shaped Hallway in The Keep~
   This hallway seems to be magical in origins, because it has a faint
glow about itself. As you look around, you can't really tell where
you are, or even if your right side up. The hallway is quite disconcerting.

   This small closed off room is looks like it has not seen a living
being in centuries. The floor is littered with the ruins of tapistrys
and paintings, and other odd knick-knacks. The heavy breathing of
a very large creature can be heard echoing off the walls.

   Inside the deathknights abode, the waves of black, evil power can
almost be seen emitting from the deathknight. The room is covered with
the spoils of the deathknight, all sorts of items, mostly all rusted
and worn from age. The whole room is pitch-black, the only thing that
can be seen is two glowing red eyes. A evil hiss seems to fill the
room as the deathknight stands to rid you of your life.

such an evil area.
