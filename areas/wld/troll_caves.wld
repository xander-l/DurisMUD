&+yA Small Hole~
   This hole is dank and chilly, and there are several insects brave enough
to adventure to the entrance of the hole.  The air is moist and smells like
rotten fungus.  A slight rustling sound comes from within.  The hole is
barely big enough for an average sized rothe to squeeze through.

manageable, and the walls are slippery from the condensation of the
water from the mysterious river or stream.

   &+BA small cave opens up behind the waterfall.  The walls are wet and the
&+Bfloor is entirely made up of stones placed carefully by someone.  There is a
&+Bsmall hole in the wall created to hold several big items.  Cluttered around
&+Bthe cave are small trinkets made by a dexterous being.  There are several small
&+Bitems laying in the corner by a pile of rocks.
