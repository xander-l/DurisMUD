&+gA Path Off the Mountain Pass&n~
   A path cuts through the wild grasses of the plateau here, leading from
the road to the east to the cliffs overlooking the sea coast towards the
the west. The path has been worn by the tread of many feet, and there are
wagon tracks in the dirt. Far to the east, beyond the road, a large patch of
woods can still be seen. Far in the distance, the crashing of waves can be
heard.

sounds of sea gulls can be heard from the sea coast far to the west.
On the southern side of the trail, there is a patch of grass that has
been disturbed, like someone has come from that direction and tried to
hide their tracks. Further on towards the south, the remains of an

   An abandoned wagon has been left here in the tall grasses of the
plateau. Several bodies have been piled in the back of the wagon, and
judging from their condition, the wagon has been here several days.
There is a sign painted onto the side of the wagon that reads '&+rJeronis,&n
&+rFinest Cloth-maker in Verzanan&n'. The remains of Jeronis's merchandise
lies scattered all around the wagon. Apparently the tales of bandits
on the High Road have not been exaggerated.

of the sea air gets stronger as the path continues towards the coast,
and the cries of the sea gulls are louder as well. The grasses of the
plateau have grown high on the sides of the path, at least three or
four feet. Occasionally the sounds of a small animal scurrying through

the High Road. Huge, towering &+Lpillars of rock&n can be seen jutting out
of the sea to the west, stabbing into the air like skeletal fingers.

   Inside this cave an osprey has built a nest to hatch its eggs. The
cave is very cramped, with no room for more than one person at a time,
making this a good place for the osprey to defend its young. The cave
goes deep enough into the cliff-side to give protection from any bad
weather and any animals that eat osprey eggs. There is a narrow ledge

would have to be found to reach it. At the point where the sea reaches the
cliff, what appears to be the dark shadow of a cave can just barely be seen,
but there is no way to get to it from here. From here, the only way to go

litter the beach, and small pieces of seaweed mark the highest point that
the tide reaches. The beach heads straight south, and continues to the north,

Further along the beach towards the northwest, a boat has run aground a short
distance from the shore. The sand is marked by the trails of the crabs that
scavenge the beach for small bits of food, and small holes that the crabs have
burrowed into the sand can be seen in several places. The sound of the waves
crashing into the rocks far offshore echo clearly of the cliffs. The beach

the smell of the salty sea air. Off on the horizon to the west, occasionally
the small dots of passing ships can be seen, making the journey to and from

&+yOn the Beach Near the Wrecked Ship&n~
   Far out to sea to the west, the five rocky pillars that the local seamen
call the "hand of the sea" rise out of the water, stretching over a hundred
feet above the water. Local rumors tell how the rest of the "hand" rises out
of the water to grab passing ships during the many storms that occur on this
part of the coast. As if to prove the tale, a ship lies stranded on the beach
a short distance from the shore. The water does not look terribly deep, and
surf is calm enough so that swimming to the boat to the west looks possible.
The beach continues to the north and south.

small enough so that swimming is not too difficult. The beach slopes gently
away from the shore for about twenty feet. At that point the land drops off
fast, so that the water is at least fifteen feet deep here. Directly to the
west, a wrecked ship can be seen, listing to starboard as it rests on the
sand. The ship is ominously quiet, the only sound escaping it is the squeaking
of wood on wood as the ship moves with the tide. A short distance to the east

and the tracks continue towards the west. There is a larger amount of the

odd clacking sound, the source of which cannot be seen.

into the cliff the cave extends. The are many tracks of an undeterminable
number of large creature in the sand here, leading into the cave and off to

excavation was done by unskilled miners with very crude tools. The air
in the tunnel is very damp and chilly. Apparently not many of the bandits

&+YOn the Sea Runner&n~
   This sloop looks to be perfect for use here in this hidden narrow
cave. The boat has a very shallow draft, and the mast has been modified
so that it can be removed so the boat can fit through the mouth of the
cave. A large pole lies on the deck, for use moving the sloop until the
sail can be erected. The sloop is not all that large, being just big enough
for ten to fifteen people to squeeze on board, and has been made to sail
with just three or four. A small set of stairs leads below the deck, and
the pier is to the north.

   The hold is filled with water barrels and crates of food. Upon closer
inspection, all the foodstuffs are fairly fresh, the boat appears to be
ready to sail at a moments notice. An extra sail and some extra rope have
been stowed in the aft section of the hold, neatly piled out of the way,
but within easy reach if needed in a hurry. From the amount of work needed
to keep the boat this well maintained and well stocked, this escape route
is evidently important to the bandits. Stairs lead back up to the deck.

glowing disk provides light for the cave. Several wooden cots are
spread around the room, along with a few chairs. Most of the cots have
a wooden box under them, but a few do not. A small fire pit has been
dug in the floor to provide warmth.

wandering around somewhere, because nearly all of the cots look like
they were slept in recently, but most are currently empty. To the south

   A long corridor leads from north to south here. This corridor looks

a dwarf curse whoever carved out this hallway.

the bandits cook their meals. In the center of the cave, a ring of
stones marks the cook fire. Directly above the ring, a small opening
can be seen where the the smoke is vented from the room. The bandits
must eat a lot of seafood, based upon the large amount of fish bones
and crab shells littering the floor. The cave continues to the east,

hewn corridor walls slowly give way to the naturally formed walls of
cave that been formed through centuries of erosion. The corridor leads

   A quick glance around shows that this cave is huge. The ceiling is at
least twenty-five feet high, and the cave is one-hundred feet wide by one-
hundred fifty feet long. This part of the cave is used by some of the
bandits as sleeping quarters. There are blankets and bundles of clothing
used as pillows all about the floor. Other than the clothing, there are
no personal belongings in evidence. The only thing else in this part of
the cave is the remains of some of the bandits meals, fish bones and the
like. The cave continues to the north and east.

&+LIn a Large Cave&n~
   This part of the cave must be used by some of the tougher bandits.
There is a fire burning in a fire pit in the center of this area, and
its warmth makes it much more comfortable in this part of the cave. The
smoke from the fire drifts over to a large hole in the ceiling in the
corner of the cave, where it apparently makes its way out of the cave.
Light from the glowing disk suspended from a cable in the ceiling reflects
off a set of metal rungs set into the wall below the hole. The hole appears
large enough for a person to fit through, but the light shining into the
hole is swallowed up by the darkness after a few feet. The rest of the cave
can be seen to the east and south.

   More blankets are strewn about the floor in this part of the cave.
Even though the blankets are not cramped together, the cave is quite
large, and the bandit gang must have at least thirty or more people in
it, judging by the number of blankets in the cave. Trash litters the sand
all around, mostly bones and shells from the bandit's meals. A stiff breeze
blows toward the western end of the cave, stirring the cool, damp air of
the cave, making it quite chilly. A corridor leads off to the east, and small
fires can be seen in the cave to the west and south.

for an even surface to play cards and toss dice. The bandits must also use
this area to practice, because a target dummy and several wooden weapons are
propped against the eastern wall. Another of the glowing disks is hanging

&+LIn a Long Shaft&n~
   The iron rungs in he wall lead up into the darkness of this cramped
shaft. The rungs are very slippery, having been coated with a light coat
of oil to protect them from the salt water environment this close to the
ocean. Smoke from the cave below is carried up through the shaft by a stiff
air current, and drifts upward to the top of the shaft. The shaft is narrow,
but there is enough room so that the climbing is not too difficult. The
shaft continues upwards, and open up onto a large cave below.

the shaft, and an iron handle can be seen in the middle of the roof. A
pair of well-oiled hinges can be seen at one end of the roof, and the
entire roof section pivots to form a trap door leading up out of the

and from the harbor at Verzanan. Off to the west, several pillars of
rock jut out of the water, reaching towards the sky like the fingers of a
titan. A wrecked ship can be seen below, having come to its final resting
place not far from the beach. A small path leads off to the east, and there

   The tall grasses of the plateau hide a small clearing that overlooks
the road to Verzanan that can be made out in the distance to the east.
From here, the bandits watch for the many caravans and merchants that travel
between Verzanan and the northern cities, choosing the victims for their raids.
The path that leads from the road to the beach can also be watched from here,
making this a perfect post for a lookout. One of the bandits must be kept
on duty here, because there is trash left in the tall grass, and thick
blanket lies in the clearing to keep the sentry warm from the strong breeze
off the sea. A path leads through the grass to the west.

around the outside of the circle. A brazier sits in the very middle of
the circle, emitting a strong but not unpleasant aroma. A table in the
corner of the room is covered with various spell components and an open
book. The light from the many flickering candles causes the &+Lshadows&n to
writhe and contort, as if alive and in agony. The &+Lshadows&n seem to gather
around an &+Wornate mirror&n on the northern wall. The only exit is through
the door to the south.

Entrance to a Cave~
   A large cave opens off the beach here, leading deeper into the cliff side
towards the north. The walls of this cave look like they have been widened
using very crude tools, and judging by the size of the opening, it was made
for something large. There are some odd looking tracks in the sandy floor,
leading from outside into the depths of the cave. Loud, but unidentifiable
clacking noises echo from further inside the cave. The cave leads back to
the beach to the south.

The Crabmen Meeting Room~
   This large cave serves as the gathering place for the &+Rcrabmen&n. There are
tracks in the sand leading in all directions out of the cave, and there are
many depressions worn in the sand from the countless &+Rcrabmen&n inhabiting these
caverns. This cave also shows the signs of having been enlarged to suit the
needs of the &+Rcrabmen&n. There are many bright &+Wshells&n and other assorted items
that the crabmen have scavenged from the beach laying in neat piles around
the cave. All of these items appear to be worthless, but must mean something
to their collectors, because the &+Wshells&n have been brightly polished. Passages

A Short Tunnel~
   This tunnel has been carved out of the very rock of the cliffside.
The walls bear the marks of the &+Rcrabmen's&n claws, their crude but effective
mining skills being more than sufficient to enlarge this natural cave into
a burrow to live in. The air here is damp, with the strong scent of the
sea drifting on the air currents that ventilate the burrow. The tunnel
appears to open onto a larger room to the west, while it leads to a large
cave to the east.

this small &+Rcrabman&n tribe. This is the biggest of the lairs in the burrow,
the ceiling being at least fifteen feet tall, and the room roughly having
the shape of a ten foot radius circle. At one end of the lair, a large
depression has been formed in the sand from where the &+Rcrabman&n sleeps. A
small niche has carved in the northern wall, and several brightly polished
&+Wshells&n and other various shiny, but worthless nick-knacks are on display.

needs. The tunnel itself gives testimony to the inhabitants of this burrow,
the ceiling is approximately twelve feet high, and the tunnel has been cut

brought in to feed the baby crabmen. There are several wading &+bpools&n all
around the cave, each large enough to hold many of the small &+Rcrabmen&n. In

   One of the &+Rcrabman&n has cleared out a small cave to serve as his lair
here beyond the tunnel. The walls have been excavated so that the room is
large enough to handle the &+Rcrabman's&n large girth, and they bear the crude
marks that are characteristic of the &+Rcrabmen's&n digging. Scattered all over
the floor are several fist-sized balls of &+ysand&n, most centered around the
&+Rcrabman's&n resting place in the center of the chamber. The only exit is back

   The &+Rcrabmen&n have made this tunnel to join the lairs further in the

two humans to easily walk side by side, but would just barely be large
enough for one &+Rcrabman&n to squeeze through. The tunnel leads into a chamber

   This lair shares the same basic construction as the others in the burrow,
but the items in the room are markedly different than the polished bits
of &+Wshell&n found in the rest of the lairs. While there are a few &+Wshells&n here,
by far most of the objects are made of &+Gseaweed&n and driftwood. Several pieces
of driftwood have been carved to resemble figures from the tribes' mythology.
Even the &+Gseaweed&n has been woven into shapes that while appearing foreign to
non-crabmen eyes, show remarkable skill and care in their creation. Another

corner, several half-polished &+Wshells&n lie waiting for the crabmen to come
finish the job. A niche have been carved in the wall to hold some of the
pieces the tribe finds most valuable. The only exit from the room is to the

&+bIn the Water by the Boat&n~
   The &+Bwaves&n gently lap against a grounded barque here. A large hole
can be seen in the hull of the ship, well below the boat's waterline.
The ship must have floundered on some of the rocks further out and
luckily made it this close to the beach before running aground. The
bottom of the ship rests in the sand twelve to fifteen feet below the
surface, and at least part of the cargo hold must be flooded. A rope
ladder hangs from the side of the ship, leading to the ships deck
above. The beach lies a short distance to the east.

&+YThe Bow of the Wind Dancer&n~
   From here on the bow, it is easy to see that the ship is listing to
starboard. The list is large enough to make those unused to ships walk
cautiously. Looking toward the stern, a torn sail can be seen hanging
from one of the two remaining masts, flapping slightly in the breeze.
The breeze brings the smell of burnt &+ywood&n and the unmistakable odor of
&+Ldecay&n. The ship does not look as if it has been here for long, but the
odor conjures thoughts of ancient ruins or long buried tombs. The deck
continues to the west, and a rope ladder descends over the side of the
to the sea below.

   Part of the third mast and its rigging lies across the deck here.
Judging from the base of the mast, it looks as if the mast shattered
in a violent storm, sending the rigging and sail crashing to the deck.
There is a large opening in the center of the deck here, leading into
the dark cargo hold of the ship. The smell of &+Lrot&n and &+Ldecay&n is strongest
here, emanating from inside the hold. The winch used to load cargo into
the hold was crushed by the falling mast, but there is a ladder on one
side of the opening leading down into the dark depths of the hold. The
deck of the Wind Dancer extends east and west of here.

in the center of the deck next to the navigator's compass. The wheel
and compass appear to have suffered little damage, a stark contrast
to the rampant destruction seen on the rest of the ship. A burnt and
&+Lsoot&n-stained doorway leads into the stern castle. There are stairs on
port and starboard sides of the ship that lead up onto the deck above
the stern castle, and the main deck continues to the east.

very rear of the deck. There is a &+Lblackened&n area near the center of
the deck that looks as if it would collapse if any weight was placed
on it. The &+rfire&n that must have started below decks must have been put
out quickly, because the damage does not look too severe. There are

directly across from the door. A dresser is against the western wall,
fastened to the deck to prevent movement in rough seas. The western
side of the cabin draws the most attention though, because the wall
has been &+Lscorched&n by the fire that raged somewhere here below decks.
The armoire that was mounted on the wall has been almost totally

wall lies in several pieces on the floor. The dresser has been reduced
to splinters, and the clothing that was inside has been shredded and
strewn about the room. Amidst the rubble that litters the floor, the
remains of children's toys can be found. Upon closer inspection, the
torn clothing was made for a child too. Marks have been gouged in the
walls and on the bigger pieces of the destroyed furniture that look

where the fire destroyed the supports, making the floor collapse. Through
the hole the flooded hold can be seen, the dark waters making it impossible
to see what remains in the hold. Everything that would have been of interest

large chart table in the center of the room is still in reasonably good shape,
but all the maps have been torn to pieces. An &+Yastrolabe&n that has been twisted
and mangled lies in the floor next to the table. The cot anchored to the wall
has had its sheets and mattress ripped off and thrown on the floor. The drawers
of the captain's dresser have been pulled out and their contents lies scattered

   The ladder leading down into the hold has reached the water that has
flooded the hold. Debris and small pieces of timber float in the water,
and the water laps against the ladder as it moves with the waves from
outside. The water quickly swallows the light that shines upon it, making
it impossible to tell what lies beneath the surface. Judging from size of
the ship, the water has filled three-fourths of the hold. The water has
probably kept any looters from getting to any cargo that the ship carried
before it ran aground. Occasional splashes echo from further back in the
hold, from where the light doesn't reach. The ladder leads back up to the
deck, and under the water to the hold.

hooks in the floor, but whatever cargo they held in place broke loose in
the storm. The loose cargo has smashed just about everything in sight,

Barrels of ale have been cracked open, their contents having settled into
an amber colored sludge that is stirred up by the current in the hold. On

small table has been nailed to the floor in the middle of the room, and
must have been used by the off-duty crew to eat and play cards or dice.
Most of the crew stored their belongings in duffel bags hung next to their
hammocks, but these have been torn apart and emptied onto the floor. In the
