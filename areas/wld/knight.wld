&+WCave Entrance~
   There is a cave here with a wooden door latched to it. The cave door has a
symbol painted on it, bearing a cross and sword. The door has no key hole,
which is odd. Just about anybody could wander in-- unless whatever was in
inside would be unhealthy for the unworthy adventurer. Some shrubbery grow to
the side of the cave. There are no exits from here unless one intends to enter
the cave, or go back from whence they came. An inscription glows under the
symbol on the door.

            This test is rigorous and very difficult even for
            the most hardy adventurers. Make sure that you are
            prepared for this test or at least, that you have
            a LOT of help-- else, prepare to make this cave
            your grave.

	    BE FOREWARNED! ONCE YOU ENTER HERE, YOU ARE COMMITTED!

  The cave is lit with torches from each wall. The ground feels sturdy and cold.The cavern is completely silent. There are, however, intermittent sounds of hoofbeats echoing throughout the tunnels to the north. The cavern is solid
granite, and the only escape from here would be south through the door, or
north into the unknown. There is what looks like a &+Wsign&N sticking out of
the ground in the center of the room.

                    Be brave warriors! You must be able

                    test with pure guts, sweat, and

                    endure the beating taken here.

                    Good luck, young apprentices to

axe is designed differently. Some axes have serrated edges and other axes have
spikes sticking out from the opposite sides. The handle of another axe is
wrapped with brown leather rather than just bare wood. The axes are secured
into the wall and cannot be removed. A &+ggreen door&N is to the south, and a

continuously shoot from one hole to the other. One must be careful not to move

twirl in mid air. The spinning spiked balls were carefully placed in mid air so
that one may carefully pass through this room without getting pummeled. On the
ceiling, holes are carved into stone allowing the smoke to escape and also
providing oxygen to feed the flames. A &+Rcrimson door&N is to the north and a

              Welcome, brave warrior, to the Test of
              Speed. You have done well to make it this
              far; but the test has only begun. You have
              learned to endure and clearly understand
              battle tactics. However, all of this will
              do you no good unless you are quick at it.
              You must be able to withstand trips,
              watch for back stabbing, and dodge blows
              to survive in any battle. Thus, you must
              endure the next test before you. Be quick
              about it, or death may be quicker.

              Oh, and by the way, you may cast here if
           you like-- if you can get a spell off in time!

difficult to run quickly or dodge. Skeletons of knights who attempted to pass

tipped on the ground, leaking their contents in the sand. Someone or something

                  Truly Amazing! You have surpassed
                  many a difficult test. The fact that
                  you have done this should give you
                  some small hope that you will pass
                  the next test. You must strive to
                  withstand those spells casted
                  against you to win any battle
                  against foes that use sorcery
                  against you. Therefore, it is this
                  test that gauges your ability to do
                  so. This test is deadly, for I,
                  Morlanthra the Great, have taken
                  it and nearly died. Of course, I

&+Yit. The universe does not feel as though it were a bunch of scattered stars
&+Yand galaxies...but as one thing...one being. Within the active sun, a black
&+Ydoor is barely visible. There are no exits other than this door.

&+W   Again, there are no ceilings, floors, or walls in this room. There is
&+Wjust blinding, searing bright light. One may have to cover their eyes to
&+Wadjust to the light. To the west, a small cloud hovers under the light. A
&+Wshimmering door lies west!

&+YPirate's Tunnel~
   The room is dark and cold. The floor is covered with sand, making it
difficult to run quickly or dodge. Skeletons of knights who attempted to pass
this room lie on the floor with daggers in their backs and sides. A hardy "Aye
matey!" echoes through the cavern and other tunnels. Small tankards of ale are
tipped on the ground, leaking their contents in the sand. Someone or something
was here just a minute ago, drinking the ale, but seems to be missing at the
moment.
