&+LA Long Winding &+yDusty&+L Road&n~
&+y   This well traveled road has many tracks upon it, everything from mice to
&+yhorses have set foot upon this road.  The forest and mountains on either
&+yside of this encampment tend to block out the sun, and it's as though dusk or
&+ydawn never happen.  Dust fills the air from chatty travellers, walking to and
&+yfro the encampment to the south.  Smoke fills the air and the smell of freshly
&+ycooked meat fills the nostrils.

&+L   A dirt pathway to the north leads in quite another direction than the
&+Lpeople who want to have a good time go, it is the means of exiting this
&+Lcarnival.  Most people are noticibly enjoying themselves, laughing heartedly
&+Lwith grub and brew in either hand.  A few shops are visible, for this road
&+Lrunning east and west is apart of the merchandising square, where fools part

&+C  "Look at all the happy creatures dancing all along", someone says amongst
&+Cthe crowd of folks gathered around the shop to the north.  It is impossible to
&+Cdiscern the nature of the shop.  An old sign hangs down from an entrance way,
&+Cit is however, not legible.  Smells of certain distinctness come from the shop,
&+Csmells similiar to an apothecary.

&+YThe path to the south runs though some brush.  From the smell and looks of it,
&+Yit would appear that particular section is where the barbiquers and vendors
&+Ywell their food.  A shop to the north distinguishes itself to the north.

&+Lone reads &n'&+mShop of the Headless Drow&n'&+L.  Another, to the south, reads
&n'&+gShop of Trollskin&n'&+L.  Many passerbyers either enter one of the shops
&+Lor stop to glance through the windows.  Whether or not the merchandise is
&+Lworth buying is another matter entirely.  Most people come here to spend
&+Lmoney, the shopkeepers realize this, and set up shop.  Just having something
&+Lavailable is better than nothing, therefore, nothing bought in any of these
&+Lstores is readily worth the price paid.

&+WThe path is dusty, off to the side of the path weeds make it nearly impossible

&+yIts pen is filled with hay, dung, and other scraps of food.  Since the exit is

&+gand in their mind it seems to have succeeded.  The pen in which it's being held
&+gin is half full of water, and half land.  Fungi and algae inhabit most of the
&+gwater, not that it bothers the half-reptilian.

&+yand the wood looks rotten and the ropes look like their in bad shape

&+yA smelly troll stands guard over the bridge and demands a toll to cross it.&N

&+LFor&+gest Clearing&N~
&+L   Here is another forest clearing but it looks like it could be the&N
&+Lway out or it could be the end of a hapless adventurers life if&n
&+Lone is not careful. The trees are becoming more and more&n
&+Lclose together and a breeze can be felt from up ahead.&N

&+LFor&+yest Path&N~
&+L   Here the path continues and the sounds of flowing water can&N
&+Lbe heard up ahead and also the path comes to a end and is blocked&N
&+Lby debris. It is uneasy to get any barings as the forest&N
&+Lis still has a strong stench of evil and you can feel the&N
&+Lcold air blowing all around.&N

&+bFast flo&+Bwing River&N~
&+B   Here the water seems to be flowing very fast and one can easily lose his or&N
&+Bher grip in the current and be swept into the mouth of a giant whirlpool&N
&+Bwhich is seen up ahead and its giant funnel pulls everything&N
&+Binside its powerful maw as you try and fight the current.&N
&+BThe water is almost freezing and has not had a chance to turn to ice.&N
