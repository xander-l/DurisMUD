&+WThe &n&+rHeart &+Wof the &n&+BStorm~
&+W   This large area is what is causing the massive whirlroom that makes up
&+Weverything that is above. Below this area there seems to be... &+Lnothingness&+W,
&+Wor atleast the absense of something. Whatever it is is creating a suction of
&+Wsuch magnitude that everything seems to be sucked down. The lack of anything,
&+Weven air here, makes this room a huge roar, where even words cannot even be
&+Wheard becuase of the speed which the winds are moving.

&+C   This first room of the &n&+LFortress&+C of Mist is very large for a building
&+Cthat looked so thin and frail from the outside. This long hall seems to
&+Cextend to the south a good ways. The walls here are made of some sort of
&+Cinvisible form of force that keeps the mists and storm trapped as the walls
&+Cof this citadel. The floors and walls are constantly shifting all over the
&+Cplace, making the footing rather difficult.

pillar~
&+C   The four pillars are each totally differant. The first seems to have a
&+Chumid mist in it and looks heavier then air. On the side of it in magical
&+Ctext it says &+WSi&+w'&+WCiltron. The second is made of &+Lblack &+Cair, maybe smoke. Under
&+Cit it says &+LGalzron&+C. The third seems to be &+bch&+Will&+bed &+Cair and it is frosted and
&+Cis very pretty, under it is says &+WEc&+bthi&+Wus&+C. Finally the last is full of powerful
&+Wlightning&+C that is constantly striking all over the place. Under it is the name

&+Cat a time to fit through and is really uncomfortable. Below is the room
&+Cof pillars while above is the Chamber of Choices. Finally the walls here are
&+Cfull of fog. It is almost impossible to see anything on the other side of the
&+Cwall due to the heavy view.

&+CChamber of &n&+BChoi&+Cces~
&+C   This large room seems to be a large room that is made in the shape of a
&+Csphere. To the west and east two passageways seem to branch out, while above
&+Clooks to head into the top of the Fortress itself. All about the sphere it
&+Clooks like a plasma globe as lightning flashes all about its surface, making
&+Cthis area very well lit.

&+CUpper Passageway &+Wto the &+BTo&+Cwer~
&+C   This small passageway is a very tight fit. It could be comfortable but one
&+Cwould have to be made of air or mist. It is just big enough for one person
&+Cat a time to fit through and is really uncomfortable. Above is what looks
&+Cto be a large landing platform, while below is the Chamber of Choices. Finally
&+Cthe walls here are full of fog. It is almost impossible to see anything on the
&+Cother side of the wall due to the heavy view.

&+C   This large platform seems to be coated in mist, which shrouds it from
&+Coutside eyes, but somehow lets anyone here see out into the Plane of Air.
&+CThe area here is very large and looks to be a massive of clouds that are
&+Cties together with some invisible force. To the west of this large platform
&+Cthere is a large door.

&+C   This large room seems to double as both the chamber of war for the Air
&+CElemental Noble Si'Ciltron, and also as his person chambers. Scattered all over
&+Cthe place are maps made of illusions and differant battle plans. In the middle
&+Cof the room is a massive table with a large map of the Air Plane on it that
&+Cseems to show all the diefferant Fortresses of Air.

&+Cbut is like a miniture variant of it. However it is much faster and stronger

&+Capproaches it back out to where they came. The only way to possibly enter it
&+Cis to enter the huge top of the Palace itself.

&+C   This area is really a blessing. All about the wind is howling but this calm
&+Carea is perfect. The wind is cool and refreashing, but not cold. All around
&+Cthe power of the tempest is evident as the power of the Air Plane screams
&+Cits strength to any who will hear, making a mighty torrent of power. Here
&+Chowever is calm and peace.

&+C   This large area is very close to the connection with the quasi-plane
&+Cof lightning. All about lightning comes in in curtains and sheets from every
&+Cdirection. Lightning flashes everywhere here, making it almost impossible for
&+Canyone to not be shocked to some degree. Above is the top of the storm, where
&+Cthe lighting brings in the power and energy to run the maelstrom.

&+CThe Maelstrom of &+LThunder &+Cand &+WLightning~
&+C   This area is at the entrance to the quasi-plane of lightning. Above is a
&+Csolid sheet of lightning that only the most stupid of travelers would try and
&+Cgo through. All around bolts of energy cascade down into the storm of the
&+CElemental Plane of Air. The only safe place in this area is the center where
&+Cthere is a platform of hard air that connects to the lightning around it
&+Cthrough massive chains.

&+COutside the &+BTem&+Cpest~
&+C   This area is just outside the tempest that lies between the quasi-plane
&+Cvacuum and the quasi-plane of lightning. Here the air is a lot calmer and
&+Cthe wind is beginning to die down. There is still a fairly powerful breeze,
&+Cbut it is not anything that could push a person. The skies here are beginning
&+Cto clear and it seems like a very nice area.

&+LThe Fortress of Smoke~
&+L   Emerging from the smoke of the area is the huge fortress that guards
&+Lagainst any encroachment from Kossuth and the fire plane. This fortress stands
&+Lin guard against the Quasi-Plane of Smoke. The fortress is a shifting thing
&+Lthat seems to totally block all those within from prying eyes. As the heat
&+Lcomes in from the west the large structure shimmers and wavers in the air. The
&+Lonly thing that can really be made out about it is the large gate that is the
&+Lentrance into the hellish place.

&+Lof Air and Fire together. The smoke and heat seem to come in huge waves from
&+Lthe east pulluting the prestine air here with vile, nasty blackness that seems
&+Lto get everywhere and cling to everything. The heat itself is oppressing here
&+Land burns anything that is not either soaking wet or somehow protected from

&+CThe &+LFortress &+Cof &n&+BIce~
&+B   This massive contruction is a huge fortress that has been built out of the
&+Bice from the Quasi-Plane to the west. The huge structure is build with one
&+Bsingle tower that extends both downward and upward and a large wall that
&+Bextends around the entire structure. It rotates slightly in its own small
&+Bgravity sphere. The only way to get in is a large gate of ice that is in
&+Bfront of the massive fortress.
