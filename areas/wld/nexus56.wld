&+YThe Gates of Nexus&N~
&+y   The room is large, easily large enough to accomodate caravans of merchants
&+yor parties of emissaries come to visit the City.  The walls are of glossy pure
&+ymarble, the ground is of jet black slate, while the streets just visible
&+ythrough the massive gates are of simple granite.  The gates themselves are
&+ysimply huge.  Great wooden beams crossed by bands of magically enhanced
&+Wtitanium&N &+yblock any exit to the east, while towards the west lays the way
&+yfrom this grand city.  Against the north wall rests a great bronze dragon,
&+ywhose ancient shrewd eyes watch you with great care.

&+Lsmoothly oiled hinges open and closed.

&+LJust Inside the Gates&N~
&+L   Upon entering the city of Nexus through the massive gates, the scents,
&+Lsounds and vivid sights overwhelm the senses.  A myriad of voices seem to
&+Lfill the air, speaking in languages and dialects from every corner of the
&+Lworlds, while the scents and smells of bodies pressing close together rise
&+Lto meet the nostrils.  Bright colors clash with dull, movement contrasting
&+Lwith stillness, the City of Nexus is a chaotic mix of peoples and beings
&+Lwho all live together, interacting easily, with no sense of disharmony or
&+Lemnity.  To the north and south are barred doorways leading to gatehouses,
&+Lto the west lies the exit through awesomely huge gates guarded by sternly
&+Lwatching Minotaurs, while towards the east proceeds the way further into
&+Lthe city.

&+LA Small Guard Room&N~
&+L   This room is small, filled with equipment and supplies for the various
&+Lguards of the city of Nexus.  Against the east wall lies equipment lockers,
&+Lwhile along the south wall is a giant map of the city itself, showing the
&+Lpoints of interest that the guards are responsible for maintaining all peace
&+Lwithin.  Along the west wall are bunks, a few of them holding sleeping or
&+Lrelaxing guards as they await their next work-shift.  The only exit is to
&+Lthe south.

&+LRoad of the Gates&N~

&+Lare polite in giving way to carts or wagons and streaming around the wide-eyed

&+LIntersection of Mindflayer's Way and Gate Road&N~
&+L   This part of the street connects the road to the city gates with the
&+Llong expanse of Beholder's Way.  Looking north, one can see a large and
&+Lquite ornate building along the northwest corner of the city walls, while
&+Lsouthwards lay two more very large buildings.  It seems as though before
&+Leach of the buildings are houses and shops of the same type, giving the
&+Limpression that each of the large buildings denotes separate neighbor-
&+Lhoods or clans.  The exits are towards the north and south into the city
&+Land west to the gates.

&+LIntersection of Mindflayer's Way and Gorgon Path&N~
&+L   Mindflayer's Way runs north and south through the city of Nexus.  The
&+Llong road is broken periodically by cross-intersections leading towards
&+Leither other streets or into houses and shops.  Looking to the northwest
&+Lone can see a large ornate building, while nearer to the southwest lie
&+Ltwo other buildings, both towering over the houses surrounding them.  The
&+Lpeople who walk through this part of the city seem to be mainly comprised
&+Lof humanoid and &+MIllithid&+L races, as though this may be their region
&+Lin the city.

&+LGuard's Walk on the Southwest Wall&N~
&+L   This is where the guards patrol the walls, looking for possible enemy
&+Lcoming from the outside, as well as to guard against potential problems
&+Lfrom within the great City of Nexus.  The guards walk in regulated areas
&+Land patterns, each having a different sector to watch over.  At no time
&+Lare visitors allowed up to these heights, for fear of diversion of the
&+Lguards from their duty.

&+L   This is the entry for the embassy of the Evil races.  The room has been
&+Ldarkened as to provide comfort for the sensitive eyes of the dwellers of

&+Lswirling around visitors.

&+LA Dingy Alley&N~
&+L   This alley is dark, damp, smells horrible and the visibility is down-
&+Lright miserable.  There are strange sounds echoing all through this area,
&+Land any passersby do so at great speed, taking no time to look around or
&+Ldawdle for fear of being accosted by whatever lives in this miserable spot.
&+LHere, the pathway is narrow, but seems to open up more fully the further
&+Lone goes into the alley, a perfect spot for a setup.

&+LUp the Stairs&N~
&+L   The stairs reach high overhead, running up to the top of the tower.
&+LThe room is large, the steps worn deeply from the years of guards walking
&+Lup to take their posts.  The walls of this tower are exceedingly thick,
&+Lmade this way to keep the guards safe from any type of aggressive actions
&+Lby either enemies from outside the walls, or perhaps even from riotors or
&+Lfights within the city.  One would be wise to step carefully here, else
&+Lface the risk of being detained as trespassor!

&+Land patterns, each having a different sector to watch over.  At no time

&+cP&+Cl&+ca&+Cn&+ca&+Cr&N &+cCauseway&N~
&+g   Running north to south through the east side of Nexus, the Planar
&+gCauseway is inhabited by the more feared races of the world.  It is not
&+guncommon to see Dragons walking side-by-side with a&N &+LShadow&+rBeast&+g, or
&+gperhaps&N &+RImix&N &+ghaving a conversation with&N &+LTiamat&N. &+gIn this part of the
&+gcauseway, one can see the three major houses of the Dragons, Elementals and
&+gUndead, where their emissaries reside and ponder on matters pertaining to
&+gtheir existence.  To the northeast is the House of Elemental Lords, neces-
&+gsarily large due to the size of the Elemental occupants, yet at the same
&+gtime, quite modest, sporting no extra decorations or ornamentations. Far to
&+gthe northeast, another large building can be spotted, its highly detailed
&+gand muraled exterior showing the typical narcississim of the Dragon races.
&+gClose to the northeast reside the Undead Lords, who live in a decidedly
&+gdark and austere House.

&+LClimbing the Tower&N~
&+L   The stairs reach high overhead, running up to the top of the tower.
&+LThe room is large, the steps worn deeply from the years of guards walking
&+Lup to take their posts.  The walls of this tower are exceedingly thick,
&+Lmade this way to keep the guards safe from any type of aggressive actions
&+Lby either enemies from outside the walls, or perhaps even from riotors or
&+Lfights within the city.  One would be wise to step carefully here, else
&+Lface the risk of being detained as trespassor!

&+yHouse, as well as those who care for the Elemental Lords.  The building is
&+ylarge, yet because of the few that live within, the rooms are set up with
&+ymore luxury than the average servant could dream of.

&+yagainst the west wall is a large gaming table with figurines depicting

&+yroom is kept scrupulously clean, clutter is non-existent, and one can
&+ytell that the servants are quite proud of their position within the

&+yare careful to keep the area tidy, their beds made, clothing packed away

&+cHis symbol carefully and delicately wrought in embroidery on a dainty&N &+Baltar-

&+yof the hall was decreased in order to make the living quarters that much
&+ymore spacious.  As it is right now, even turning around quickly or in-
&+ycautiously may result in bruised elbows or other body parts, and the larger
&+yraces may find it impossible to enter!

&+yarea is stocked full of leftover delicacies from whatever banquets and
&+yparties that the Undead and Elemental Lords have held.

&+yThat one could have a room entirely of his own, with nobody else living
&+yin it, is a mind-staggering event, and this servant obviously takes a
&+ygreat deal of pride in caring for his room.  The floor is immaculate, the
&+ybed made with sharply turned creases, the clothing within the wardrobe is
&+yfolded and hung up with exquisite care.

&+ysomeone is moving in now.

&+mEntrance to the Servants' Quarters&N~
&+m   The room here is the entryway for one of the many servants' quarters
&+mneeded to house the multitude of servants within the city of Nexus.
&+mThere's a stillness here, quiet seems to reign in contrast to what must
&+mbe an everlasting din and activity within the Palace, and any people seen
&+mare relaxing or sleeping.  One can only imagine that the servants are ex-
&+mhausted from their hard labors for the leaders of Nexus.

&+mThe Servants' Quarters Lounge&N~
&+m   This is the lounge in the servants' quarters.  The room is sparse, with
&+mthe bare minimum of chairs and tables, and due to the extremely high work-
&+mload these poor souls have, it is obvious they have no time whatsoever to
&+mbe able to take advantage of any relaxation here.  Instead, one must guess
&+mthat they finish their chores, eat a paltry meal and fall into bed in total
&+mexhaustion.

&+mA Servant's Room&N~
&+m   This room obviously is being used by one of the servants as their
&+msleeping quarters.  There's a bed against one wall, a cupboard against
&+mthe other which holds several uniforms showing that this servant works
&+mfor the Evil contingent.  From the size of the bed, one would assume
&+mthat this person is either Ogre or Troll, since it would dwarf anyone
&+melse.

&+mThe Womens' Dormitory&N~
&+m   This room seems to be the one used by the female servants, as there is
&+ma lightly sweet scent floating in the air, flowers decorate the window-
&+msill and the beds are covered with finely embroidered spreads, something
&+mdecidedly lacking in the other dorm rooms.  Only one bed seems to be in
&+muse at the moment, perhaps the other residents are busy with their jobs.

&+mThe Laborers' Dormitory&N~
&+m   This room appears to be where the general laborers rest, as seen by the
&+mdusty clothing hanging from hooks, the muddy boots under each bed, and the
&+mrather dirty residents of the bunkbeds that cover one of the walls.  There
&+mare no extraneous decorations here whatsoever, the walls bare, the floor
&+monly marked by scuffs and dings where the heavy boots clomp down.

&+m   This room houses the lower echelon of servants for the Evil contingent.
&+mBunks line one wall, the other is covered by cupboards and dressers for
&+mthe many uniforms and changes of clothing required by their jobs.  Soft
&+msnores emanate from several of the bunks, while the other bunks lay empty,
&+mtheir normal occupants off at work for the day.

&+mA Storage Closet&N~
&+m   This is a simple storage closet, filled with mops, brooms, buckets, all
&+mthe accessories a person would need for cleaning.  As well, the laborers
&+mkeep their personal items in here, the things they wish not to lose to any
&+mrandom thievery, such as their favorite picks and axes, a particular saw
&+mor even a certain shovel they just can't seem to live without.  Despite
&+mthe quantity of varied items in here, there is no clutter, but instead all
&+mof the items appear to be well-organized and kept tidy.

&+yEntry to the Palace Stables&N~
&+y   This is the entry to the Palace stables, where many beasts of burden
&+yare rented and sold for use to the residents and visitors that travel
&+ythrough.  The strong scent of horses, oxen, Griffons and many other types
&+yof creatures is prevelent, yet mixed with an accompanying aroma of richly
&+ypolished leather harnesses and saddles.

&+yFurther into the Palace Stables&N~
&+y   Here is where the stablekeeper barters and sells his beasts of burden.
&+yA long wooden counter bars the way into the stables themselves, while the
&+ybenches against the far wall are heavily worn, covered in piles and heaps
&+yof harnessing for the creatures heard snuffling and snorting in the next
&+yroom.  Perched on the counter is a sign listing the hours of business as
&+ywell as the basic terms of rental if the visitor to this establishment
&+ywishes to merely use one of the beasts temporarily.

&+ya small storage room&N~
&+y   This room is obviously where the majority of harnesses and saddles are
&+ykept for the horses and oxen housed in the stables.  Each item has its own
&+ypolished brass hook, and not a single strap is out of place.  In one of the
&+ycorners is the feed-box where grain is stored, while the other corners all
&+yare piled with saddleblocks to hold the exquisitely polished saddles of
&+ymore expensive horses.

&+yThe Horse Stalls&N~
&+y   This is where the large variety of horses are stabled for the use and
&+yenjoyment of the citizens and visitors of Nexus.  Soft blankets hang from
&+ybrass hooks on the walls, bundles of fresh&N &+Ggrasses&N &+yare piled on the ground
&+yEach animal has its own stall, allowing it freedom of movement yet keeping
&+yit confined and out of harm's way of the other animals.  This is a finely
&+ykept stable if the cleanliness and fine conditions are any indication.

&+yThe Oxen Stalls&N~
&+y   This is the stabling area for the many oxen and heavy beasts of burden
&+ywhich are used by the residents of Nexus for their many tasks.  The walls
&+yare deeply gouged where the creatures' sharp horns have dug into the wood,
&+ywhile the rough dirt floor shows many divots and holes where impatiently
&+ydigging hooves have scored the surface.  To the east can be heard the soft
&+ywhinnies and sounds of horses.

&+bstreet itself has been cobbled with the finest of marble stones from the
&+bmost exclusive of Dwarven mines.  The Palace comes into view as you near
&+bthe center of the street, and all first-time visitors tend to stand in

&+WA Small Temple&N~
&+W  This tiny one-roomed temple has been tucked away off of the Avenue for
&+Wlonger than the oldest residents here can remember.  A single ancient and
&+Wwithered priest tends to the building, pausing every once in a while to
&+Wpray and offer devotions to&N &+CFinder&+W, God of Bards.  The followers
&+Wof&N &+CFinder&N &+Ware few, and as such, the worshippers here are nearly
&+Wnon-existent, yet that does not stop this old Priest from trying to stop
&+Wany that enter the temple and convince them that the path of&N &+CFinder&N
&+Wis the best way to go!

&+bAvenue of Ro&+Cy&+bals&N~
&+b   The atmosphere of the City of Nexus seems to be focussed on, and come
&+bfrom, this long road.  The Avenue is lined with tall shady trees, the
&+bstreet itself has been cobbled with the finest of marble stones from the
&+bmost exclusive of Dwarven mines.  The Palace comes into view as you near

&+bInn o&+Bf God&+C's Sl&+Bumb&+ber&N~
&+B   The inn here is richly furnished, the walls covered with rare woods,
&+Bthe floors covered in the finest carpets from artisans of high repute.
&+BUpon entering, you spy the reception desk and a small Gnome who is barely
&+Bvisible behind the glowing wood.  A pair of magnificent sliding doors
&+Bblock the way further into the Inn where it is reputed that Gods have
&+Brested when in Avatar form.

&+GRoom One&N~
&+G   Here lies Room One.  This is the more popular of the Inn's rooms, for
&+Git contains the softest bed, most luxurious carpet and the view of the
&+GPalace is exquisite.  Magic enhances the quietude of the room, allowing
&+Gits occupants an extremely restful sleep.  This day, a Dwarven Ambassador

&+Brooms, since it is right by the reception desk and all the traffic to the
&+Bother rooms passes by this one.  The decor is discreet, with a simple yet
&+Bexpensive dresser on one wall, a full length mirror on the other, while

&+Rof silk bedding, satin fabric covering the walls, cocoon-silk carpets and
&+Reven the chairs are covered with exquisite and fine fabrics.  It appears
&+Rto be most appropriate for a Lady and her guards, for there are small
&+Rtrundle beds tucked under the rather large main bed.  A female's touch is
&+Ralso reflected in the lovely blooming flowers that decorate every avail-
&+Rable surface in crystalline vases.

&+Lnothing more than a simple wooden box lined with ebony fabric.  The odor
&+Lwithin the room is dank, giving rise to suspicions of who normally may

&+LRogue's Lane&N~
&+LThe lane here is named as it is because of the history of a variety of
&+Lrogues and assassins who tend to use this byway as their route between
&+Ltheir various jobs.  As well, any person of means is wise to avoid taking
&+Lthis route else they risk finding themselves relieved of any personal items
&+Lof worth.

&+LEntrance to a Dingy Shack&N~
&+L   The door to this shack is scarred with a multitude of nicks and dings
&+Las though it has been used as a target for knife throwers.  As a matter
&+Lfact, there is still a knife deeply imbedded in the door!  To the south,
&+Leven with careful examination, the interior of the shack can barely be
&+Lseen, while to the north lays the alley.

&+LInside a Dingy Shack&N~
&+L   The lighting within this one-roomed shack is just dismal.  Dark shadows
&+Lswirl and mist around, while faint chitters and squeals seem to surround
&+Lany visitor to this depressing shack.  Despite many efforts by the well-
&+Ltrained authorities of Nexus, this shack has remained and continues to be
&+Lused as a lair by the less savory inhabitants of the City.

&+CAmbassador.  Once in, however, the visitors are at a loss, for instead
&+Cof seeing a single portal, they are faced with two, and neither has been
&+Cmarked as to where they exit.

&+gA&N &+LDark&N &+gHallway&N~
&+L   This hallway runs nearly the length of the top floor of the Evil
&+LContingent's embassy.  The walls are lined with battle pennants and
&+Ltapestries proclaiming the might of all that is Evil, while the huge
&+Lrooms echo faintly with the murmering of voices mixed with the cries
&+Lof prisoners in torment.  The hall is interrupted frequently by a
&+Lmultitude of doorways that lead into unknown rooms, and only the
&+Lmost sure-footed and knowing can find their way through the labyrinth
&+Lof passages.

&+MThe Central Pool of the Elder Brain&N~
&+M   This room is taken nearly completely up by the brine-filled pool
&+Mfor the Elder Brain.  Small tadpoles float around the gigantic brain
&+Mwhich comes close to filling even this room-sized pool, while other
&+Mjuvenile Illithids attend to the Brain's every perceived need.  There
&+Mis even a small container at the side which holds still-quivering
&+Mbrains from the slaves in the basement in case the Elder wishes to
&+Mhave a snack.

&+Lmade this way to keep the guards safe from any type of aggressive actions
&+Lby either enemies from outside the walls, or perhaps even from riotors or
