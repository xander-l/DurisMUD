   It is hard to decide which is more overwhelming, the darkness, or the dank,
humid stench of rot and decay.  Trees stretch upward to create a dense cloak
that refuses to allow even the smallest amount of light down to the ground,
Twisted roots and fallen branches line the moist ground, adding their scents
to the putrid air.  A poorly constructed fence blocks passage to the north,
protecting a small swamp where a tribe of bullywugs has created a village of
decrepit buildings.  The jungle stretches off into darkness to the south,
east, and west.  It is clear that just to the west the jungle is more well-
traveled, and that the halflings of Woodseer extend their patrols to that
limit, but it is also clear that they go no further into the jungle.

   Gloomy darkness and dense, humid air make this jungle almost unbearable.
Trees stretch upward until they fan out, creating a dense canopy that blocks
out almost all light.  The little light that does get this far down serves
only to create strange shadows, shadows that can't even be chased away with
bright torches and magical lights.  Moist earth is made even softer by the
rotting vegetation, the leaves and branches that have fallen from the trees
above.  Few adventurers travel even this far into the jungle, most find the
stench unbearable, and the almost ever-present darkness unnerving.  The
trackless jungle continues in every direction.

   The simple word 'darkness' has a new meaning here.  Strange odors, mixtures
of the rot and decay of the jungle floor and the sweet smelling flowers that
dot even this gloomy area, add the scent and taste of mystery to the darkness.
Cries of animals seep through the humid air, some familiar, others so spine-
tingling that they reach down into one's soul and tickle at some primal,
unidentifiable fear.  Bards sing tales of lost cities, and great adventures in
places like this, but the tales of this jungle are few, and it is easy to see
why, few are hearty enough to withstand a darkness like this.

   This jungle, like all forests, varies in its thickness and in the plants
that grow in each particular spot.  Valuable hardwood trees grow alongside
trees that make poor lumber, or even poisonous, deadly plants and vines.
Though teaming with life, there is a darkness here that tugs at ancient and
primal fears.  It becomes even more amazing when one realizes that some of the
travelers here aren't adventurers, or foul beasts, but simple halfling
loggers.  Loggers that somehow withstand the hardships of the jungle to seek
out the most valuable trees, cut them down and bring them back.  These
halflings aren't famous, nor are they the sources of Bard's tales, yet they
have the courage to enter this foul-smelling place just to make a simple
living.

   The solid wood sides of the cabin to the west can barely be made out
through the thick trees and vines, but something indeed stands there, blocking
any passage back toward Woodseer, which lies in that direction.  A massive
ebonwood has fallen to the north, laying its slowly rotting trunk atop the
many twisting roots that line the ground.  Dense jungle continues to the south
and east, heading into a gloom causes even some of the bravest to pale.

   A fence made of mere sticks and thin logs has been erected to the north,
protecting a small swamp and the bullywug village that has been built within
it.  Bulbous eyes stare back at those bold enough to peer into the bullywug's
domain, daring one to be bold enough to enter their home.  Even the stout
halflings who make their home so nearby hesitate to fight them on their own
ground.  Only fools would dare to challenge such creatures in their own

   Soft humus pads the steps of every wanderer, both the hunter and the
hunted.  Despite the darkness, there is a beauty here, the beauty of nature
and its ability to thrive under any condition, but there is also an ugliness,
a breath of evil that seems to float through the air.  Some creatures have
been designed to thrive here in the stinking, moist air, others must simply
make do, and try to avoid becoming something else's next meal.  The darkness
that frightens away so many is a cloak of mystery to those brave souls that
come here seeking fame and fortune.

   Logs from several thing hardwood trees have been stacked here, and the drag
marks coming from the east show that a logger has been here recently.
Clearly, the labor involved in getting this quantity of lumber out of the
forest is quite prodigious.  Rare woods such as these are easy to identify, as
well as trace, so there is little fear of thievery.  Maggots spin around in
the moist earth where the dragged lumber has scraped the upper layer of
rotting vegetation away, adding a somewhat macabre air to this strangely
peaceful area.

&+gBefore the Gates to a Bullywug Village&N~
   Standing wide open, the gates to the north reveal a clear view of the low,
swampy portion of the jungle that the bullywugs have claimed as their own.
Nobody has tried to contradict their claim, but then, few would want such land
in the first place.  With their moist skins, and bulbous eyes, they are suited
for the jungle swamps, adapted to the moisture and the darkness.  The fence
enclosing the village is made up only of thin stakes planted deep into the
moist ground and would be easy enough to knock down.  Rather than real
protection, the fence and gates appear to be more of a territorial border, a
claim to what they believe is theirs.  The jungle continues to the south,
east, and west, and the gates into the bullywug swamp lie to the north.

   A large swampy area can be made out to the north and east, it appears to be
fenced in though.  The darkness here is so pervasive that any detail is
difficult to make out.  Torches and lanterns have little effect on the
darkness, simply pushing it back a bit so that the forest can be studied more
closely.  Twisted roots line the the ground, creating odd humps and
depressions underneath the thick humus that lines the ground.  The bones from
several small corpses lie shattered here, so broken that the creature or
creatures they once belonged to can't even be identified.

   The fence is of simple but sturdy construction, long thing posts planted
deep into the ground about a handsbreadth apart.  Almost complete darkness
makes it hard to discern exactly what lies beyond, but the sound of
intermittent sloshing suggests that there is some sort of swamp beyond.
Vaguely outlined humanoid creatures can be seen at times, but they are
difficult to identify, despite the fact that the swampy area beyond the fence
to the north appears to have more light than this part of the jungle.

Sounds from throughout the jungle congregate here, chasing something

light down to the jungle floor, making it relatively easy to travel through.
Dense jungle growth described in bard's tales is really only at the edges of
the jungle, where light can pass through to the ground.  It is clear that the
fancy bards that sing such tales have never truly experienced the deep jungle.
Tree trunks stretch into the heavens, as do various lianas and vines that cling

the lianas and tree trunks adding color for those actually able to see in this

   In some nearby spots the jungle canopy lets through enough light to grow
some spectacular plants, here though, the plants rely on those above them to
supply them with nutrients.  Several large bromeliards lie on the jungle floor
here, spreading their massive petals to create small pools of water that
provide life to many other creatures in the forest.  Most of the creatures here
feed on the rotting leaves, branches, and fruit that have fallen from the
canopy above, others feed on each other or on the living trees themselves.
Yes, in the deep jungle even plants are parasites, and predators, in the combat
for survival no trick shall remain unused.

&+gAlong a Cliff in the Rift Valley Jungle&N~
   Dense foliage clings to the steep cliffs that enclose this warm and humid
valley, tearing at their stony walls in some vain attempt to escape.  Warm,
humid breezes bounce off the steep walls to wind through the tall trees,
making the plants dance ever so slightly.  The breeze doesn't cool anything
down at all, but it does relieve a bit of the stench from the rotting
vegetation that supports the life in every jungle known.  As the jungle
stretches outward from here, one can sense a certain darkness, a darkness that
goes beyond simple lack of light.

   The simple word 'darkness' has a new meaning here.  Strange odors, mixtures
of the rot and decay of the jungle floor and the sweet smelling flowers that
dot even this gloomy area, add the scent and taste of mystery to the darkness.
Cries of animals seep through the humid air, some familiar, others so spine-
tingling that they reach down into one's soul and tickle at some primal,
unidentifiable fear.  Though some vague light does reach the down this far
when the sun is at its highest, it simply creates more shades of darkness to
cloak the creatures that travel here.  Bards sing tales of lost cities, and
great adventures in places like this, but the tales of this jungle are few, and
it is easy to see why, few are hearty enough to withstand a darkness such as
this.

   A massive ebonwood, surrounded by strangling liana's stands here, thrusting
its way toward the heavens.  The vines are wrapped so closely around its trunk
they provide a means to climb up its straight trunk to the canopy high above.
Despite the lack of light a variety of fungi have found the ability to grow
here, as well as some parasitic flowers, and their bright colors add life to
the darkness that seems to encompass everything.

   A dense canopy created by the treetops high above lets very little, if any
light down to the jungle floor, making it relatively easy to travel through.
Dense jungle growth described in bard's tales is really only at the edges of
the jungle, where light can pass through to the ground.  It is clear that the
fancy bards that sing such tales have never truly experienced the deep jungle.
Tree trunks stretch into the heavens, as do various lianas and vines that cling
to them as they make their own way upward.  Various parasitic flowers cling to
the lianas and tree trunks adding color for those actually able to see in this
paralyzing darkness.

   One of the few free-growing jodani trees stands here, thrusting its long
trunk upward to stretch its branches in the sunlight.  Jodani wood is one of
the finest woods in the world for creating almost anything.  It is easy to
work, withstands the elements, and has its own magical qualities to add to the
simple, elegant beauty of the red-hued wood it produces.  This tree, like all
those in the jungle, is wrapped in vines that use it to climb into the sunlight
so high above the ground.  These vines provide a way to climb up the tree into
its higher branches to study the animals of the forest canopy.

   In some nearby spots the jungle canopy lets through enough light to grow
some spectacular plants, here though, the plants rely on those above them to
supply them with nutrients.  Several large bromeliards lie on the jungle floor
here, spreading their massive petals to create small pools of water that
provide life to many other creatures in the forest.  Most of the creatures here
feed on the rotting leaves, branches, and fruit that have fallen from the
canopy above, others feed on each other or on the living trees themselves.
Yes, in the deep jungle even plants are parasites, and predators, in the combat

   The simple word 'darkness' has a new meaning here.  Strange odors, mixtures
of the rot and decay of the jungle floor and the sweet smelling flowers that
dot even this gloomy area, add the scent and taste of mystery to the darkness.
Cries of animals seep through the humid air, some familiar, others so spine-
tingling that they reach down into one's soul and tickle at some primal,
unidentifiable fear.  Though some vague light does reach the down this far
when the sun is at its highest, it simply creates more shades of darkness to
cloak the creatures that travel here.  Bards sing tales of lost cities, and
great adventures in places like this, but the tales of this jungle are few, and
it is easy to see why, few are hearty enough to withstand a darkness such as
this.

   A wide clearing to the west allows so much light to the ground here that the
jungle is almost impassable.  It is only with the greatest of struggles that
one can push their way through the bamboo shoots and baby palms to push toward
the rocky clearing to the west.  Large numbers of colorful birds and animals
dart through the trees here, as do several large predators intent on finding a
meal.  Though not as dark as the dense jungle to the north and east, this area
may be even more dangerous because the more vicious hunters of the jungle enjoy
easy meals.

&+gBy a Cliff Enclosing the Rift Valley Jungle&N~
   Sharp rocks line the steep face of the cliff to the south, even if it were
climbable, the thick vegetation here makes it nearly impossible to even
approach the cliff.  There is an open area to the west that allows enough
sunlight into this part of the jungle to create a veritable explosion in
growth.  Plants of all sorts struggle to grow as tall and strong as they can in
order to out-compete their neighbors.  A number of colorful birds and small
animals dart through the trees feeding on the bountiful growth and trying to
avoid predators.

   In some nearby spots the jungle canopy lets through enough light to grow
some spectacular plants, here though, the plants rely on those above them to
supply them with nutrients.  Several large bromeliards lie on the jungle floor
here, spreading their massive petals to create small pools of water that
provide life to many other creatures in the forest.  Most of the creatures here
feed on the rotting leaves, branches, and fruit that have fallen from the
canopy above, others feed on each other or on the living trees themselves.
Yes, in the deep jungle even plants are parasites, and predators, in the combat
for survival no trick shall remain unused.

   A thin mahogany stands here, its gnarled roots outsizing its trunk by at
least four times.  It, as well as the thin brown basarola near it, provides
support for several parasitic ferns and flowers that seem quite content to
survive here in the dank darkness.  The ferns and flowers add an acrid tang to
the air that only heightens the stench of the decaying humus that pads the
jungle floor.  The humus has been stirred up by some creature either digging
for food or creating a burrow, and the exposed dirt shows the wriggling tracks
of small maggots and millipedes.

   One of the few free-growing jodani trees stands here, thrusting its long
trunk upward to stretch its branches in the sunlight.  Jodani wood is one of
the finest woods in the world for creating almost anything.  It is easy to
work, withstands the elements, and has its own magical qualities to add to the
simple, elegant beauty of the red-hued wood it produces.  This tree, like all
those in the jungle, is wrapped in vines that use it to climb into the sunlight
so high above the ground.  These vines provide a way to climb up the tree into
its higher branches to study the animals of the forest canopy.

   A dense canopy created by the treetops high above lets very little, if any
light down to the jungle floor, making it relatively easy to travel through.
Dense jungle growth described in bard's tales is really only at the edges of
the jungle, where light can pass through to the ground.  It is clear that the
fancy bards that sing such tales have never truly experienced the deep jungle.
Tree trunks stretch into the heavens, as do various lianas and vines that cling

   A rocky clearing to the south allows a surprising amount of sunlight to
angle in beneath the canopy above.  This added light has given a number of
small plants the strength to grow upward in an attempt to break through the

of plants creates an additional following of birds, insects and other animals
here to feed on the plants, as well as each other.

   It is evident that the soil here is poor, and that the rocks that seem
strewn about by some giant hand make it difficult for plants to grow, yet there
is something strange here.  All jungle plants look for any opportunity to
expand, no matter how harsh, yet not one single plant has taken hold here, in
fact this rocky area is barren of all plant life.  A shimmering plane of light
goes in and out of focus at times, a disconcerting view, yet not enough to
prevent plants from growing here.  The rocky plain continues to the south where
it meats a cliff and to the east a ways before the jungle takes over again.

about it, as well as something ancient and forbidden.  The rocky clearing bears
the burnt corpses of birds that have flown to close, and animals that have let

   As eddies of water bounce along the cliff to the north and the thick tree
roots to the west, water seems to seep through the roots themselves oozing
westward into the jungle.  A tremendous waterfall to the east sprays a fine
mist over the entire area, helping to keep it a bit cooler.  The river is
fairly shallow here, shallow enough to swim, and in some places even wade.  A
number of animals venture into the river to cool themselves and get a drink,
but caution is the key, alligators have made this their territory, and only the
swift can avoid becoming a quick meal.

filled with strange bubbling mud that pops and hisses.  The lip of the bowl is
a good 10 feet above the ground, but could easily be climbed up to get into it.
Though why anyone would want to enter the odd bubbling cauldron is certainly a

age.  The rocky clearing continues south where another bowl can be seen nestled

the jungle animals come to drink, and hunt.  As the river heads further south
it appears to narrow and drop into some sort of gorge.  A massive volcano can
be seen further to the west, towering over even the jungle trees on the far
shore of the river.  Plumes of steam or smoke can be seen rising up from it,
but it is quite far away. The jungle continues to the north, south and west,
and a slow moving river can be waded into to the east.

   It is a bit lighter here, due to a river to the northeast that has thinned
out some of the larger trees to allow more sunlight in.  The added light has
its drawbacks however, the vegetation here is much thicker and more
treacherous.  Some of the plants and vines appear to be reaching out to embrace
whatever comes near them, and in this foul-smelling jungle such an embrace
would probably mean death.

   A dense canopy created by the treetops high above lets very little, if any
light down to the jungle floor, making it relatively easy to travel through.
Dense jungle growth described in bard's tales is really only at the edges of
the jungle, where light can pass through to the ground.  It is clear that the
fancy bards that sing such tales have never truly experienced the deep jungle.
Tree trunks stretch into the heavens, as do various lianas and vines that cling
to them as they make their own way upward.  Various parasitic flowers cling to
the lianas and tree trunks adding color for those actually able to see in this
paralyzing darkness.

   A thin mahogany stands here, its gnarled roots outsizing its trunk by at
least four times.  It, as well as the thin brown basarola near it, provides
support for several parasitic ferns and flowers that seem quite content to
survive here in the dank darkness.  The ferns and flowers add an acrid tang to
the air that only heightens the stench of the decaying humus that pads the
jungle floor.  The humus has been stirred up by some creature either digging
for food are creating a burrow, and the exposed dirt shows the wriggling tracks
of small maggots and millipedes.

   In some nearby spots the jungle canopy lets through enough light to grow
some spectacular plants, here though, the plants rely on those above them to
supply them with nutrients.  Several large bromeliards lie on the jungle floor
here, spreading their massive petals to create small pools of water that
provide life to many other creatures in the forest.  Most of the creatures here
feed on the rotting leaves, branches, and fruit that have fallen from the
canopy above, others feed on each other or on the living trees themselves.
Yes, in the deep jungle even plants are parasites, and predators, in the combat
for survival no trick shall remain unused.

   A rocky clearing can be seen to the east through the thick stands of bamboo
that the added light has allowed to grow.  Making one's way through the bamboo
would be a tedious task and likely not worth the effort when it can probably be
maneuvered around.  The added light here is pleasant, but has the side-effect of
attracting a great number of animals.  Many of these animals aren't
particularly keen on travelers, thinking they are simply another easy meal.

   A wide river to the north moves quite slowly until it hits the deep gorge
just to the east.  As the water squeezes down into the gorge it falls about 30
feet and become a roiling torrent of white water that continues its passage
down the gorge until it disappears into the face of the cliff far to the
south.  The think plants growing here make it difficult to find the edge of the
gorge to the west so travelers must be wary, a fall into that river, though not
certain death, is certainly an unwelcome added adventure.  The far edge of the
gorge to the west appears to be a mere 20-30 feet away, but appearances may be

&+gNear a Fallen Tree&N~
   A massive osage, one of the rarer trees in the jungle, has toppled over the
river here.  The trunk of the tree itself has fallen against the low branches
of some of the stouter trees that line the river banks, stretching from one low
tree to another on the other side of the river.  It is clear that many animals,
and perhaps other travelers, have used the large tree as a bridge over the
gorge, which would be too steep to climb up and down even if it weren't filled
with a rushing river.  The lip of the gorge itself is hard to detect because it
has become so overgrown with trees and bushes that have stretched outward to
catch as much sunlight as they can.  Every step taken near the edge is a
treacherous one that could plunge a traveler into the deep gorge below.

   The steep gorge below has dropped to an amazing depth, where the raging
river within it finally dives into the ground to run beneath the mountains to
some unknowable destination.  Trees, vines, and bushes have used the added
light created by the gorge to climb as far out into the air over the river as
they can.  The steep cliff to the south has also become a target for their
aggressive growth, as they cling to its walls and slowly climb their way
upward.  Some of the humidity is actually relieved by the close proximity to
the river, more due to the gap in the trees and plants created by the gorge
than for any other reason.

   Odd as it may seem, it is actually less humid here on the river than it is
within the jungle.  Although the waterfall to the north sprays a fine mist over
the entire area, there is no canopy here to hold the moisture in until it
stagnates and becomes still and uncomfortable.  Not only does the pleasant
spray make it a bit cooler here, but it adds an awe-inspiring beauty during the
daylight hours when sunlight glances off the water droplets and splits into
multi-colored rainbows.  Despite the number of animals that come here to drink
and frolic, there is a danger here, not only from the alligators that float
along looking for easy meals, but also from schools of the dreaded red piranha.

fine mist by the jagged stones of the cliff.  Spraying outward to reach even
the tall jungle trees to south, the mist cloaks all the birds and animals,
giving some relief from the oppressive heat and humidity.  The roar of the
falling water drowns out almost all sound, leaving one feeling almost deaf.  It
isn't so much the falling water though, but the way it echos from the recesses
in the cliff just to the north.  The echos are so load and confusing that few
animals wander beneath the falling water, preferring to be cooled by the spray
that stretches away from it.

continues to deepen and narrow to the south.  The high vantage point here
reveals that the river ends at the southern cliffs in the distance where it
must flow into some sort of underground cavern

be stuck here is doomed to die, as the river appears to dive underground when

&+LOn Some Broad, Flat Rocks&N~
   The large, flat rocks that lie here have become the cozy resting grounds for
a number of tremendous alligators.  It is fortunate that most of the creatures
that can be found resting here are full and in need of no additional food.
Then again, alligators, known for their laziness, are always more than willing
to grab an easy meal.  Jagged cliffs rise upward all around, and a slow-moving
river is just to the east.

   Slow moving water to the north and west generally flows south, but in such a
lazy manner it is hard to detect the current.  The gap created by the river
allows far more light to hit the ground here than would be seen deeper into the
jungle, making it possible for many more plants to join in the battle for
sunshine.  Huge numbers of jungle creatures come to the water to drink, bathe,
and simply cool themselves.  The river becomes a meeting place of sorts, as
well as a fruitful hunting ground.

   The wide river to the west makes a sudden change, flowing over a large
granite overhang into the beginning of a deep gorge where the river narrows and
drops down so fast that water froths and churns.  Further to the south the
jungle vegetation has grown out into the ravine so far that plants hang over
the edge to try to get more sunlight.  Such thick vegetation makes it almost
impossible to see exactly where the edge of the ravine actually is.

&+gNear a Fallen Tree&N~
   A massive osage, one of the rarer trees in the jungle, has toppled over the
river here.  The trunk of the tree itself has fallen against the low branches
of some of the stouter trees that line the river banks, stretching from one low
tree to another on the other side of the river.  It is clear that many animals,
and perhaps other travelers, have used the large tree as a bridge over the
gorge, which would be too steep to climb up and down even if it weren't filled
with a rushing river.  The lip of the gorge itself is hard to detect because it
has become so overgrown with trees and bushes that have stretched outward to
catch as much sunlight as they can.  Every step taken near the edge is a
treacherous one that could plunge a traveler into the deep gorge below.

   The steep gorge below has dropped to an amazing depth, where the raging
river within it finally dives into the ground to run beneath the mountains to
some unknowable destination.  Trees, vines, and bushes have used the added
light created by the gorge to climb as far out into the air over the river as
they can.  The steep cliff to the south has also become a target for their
aggressive growth, as they cling to its walls and slowly climb their way
upward.  Some of the humidity is actually relieved by the close proximity to
the river, more due to the gap in the trees and plants created by the gorge
than for any other reason.

   This majestic osage has fallen across the lower limbs of several of the
trees that line the deep gorge to the east.  When this tree once stood upright
it must have been almost 200 feet tall, now though the broken trunk provides a
bridge over the rushing water in the gorge below.  Worn smooth by the passage
of many feet, the trunk looks relatively safe, though not as safe as a real
bridge.  The agile animals of the jungle have no problems negotiating it, but

   For some reason the river looks further below from here, and far more
treacherous.  Not only has the tree trunk been worn smooth by the many animals
that have used it to cross the river, but it is also quite damp, the river
below froths so madly that spray can leap forty feet into the air and dampen
the tree making it slippery and dangerous to cross.  Every step must be a
cautious one, a fall into the river below would most likely be the last trip an
adventurer would take.

&+GOn a Fallen Tree&N~
   As the fallen osage reaches this side of the river its fallen top has
clearly been broken off beyond the branches of the stout bocote that this part
of the tree trunk as come to rest on.  The gorge to the west looks quite
treacherous but, at least in this part of the jungle, it appears that the
fallen tree trunk is the only way to cross it.  The thick jungle below obscures
the true edge of the ridge so the climb down should be made with a great deal
of caution.

   Brightly colored flowers and thick plants line the edge of the river here.
It is spots like this one that are described in bard's tales, that is due to
the fact that few souls are brave enough to penetrate into the deeper darkness
of the jungle and view the mysterious plants and animals that live there.  The
river to the north teams with life, providing both refuge and hunting ground to
many of the jungle beasts.  Animals sneak quietly to the water's edge to drink,
always looking for the alligator or tiger that might want to make it a meal,
but both the hunters and the hunted must drink, and this is the most refreshing
place to do so.

&+gA Stand of &+MOrchids&+g in the Rift Valley Jungle&N~
   The passing river to the northwest has created enough openings in the jungle
canopy that a whole new variety of jungle life can be viewed here.  A large
rock here has prevented many of the large trees from taking root, allowing a
majestic stand of glowing purple orchids to take hold here and grow.  The soft
flower petals seem to absorb light throughout the day and shed it at night,
keeping this area continually lit.  The jungle continues in every direction.

   The river passes in slow eddies to the north and west, full of fish, birds
and alligators, as well as those animals that have risked a quick dip into its
cooling waters.  Here, by the edges of the water, plants grow and struggle
against each other, trying to use the added sunlight and water to their
greatest advantage.  Most of the epiphytic plants seen in the deep jungle
aren't seen here, those plants that depend on sunlight have out-competed them
and pushed them back into the darkness.  During the day, sunlight streams
through the leaves and branches, getting sliced into long strips of darkness
and light.  Both the hunters and the hunted come to the water's edge, eyeing
each other carefully for the first signs of weakness or attack.

&+gBeside a &+yRotting Tree&N &+gin the Rift Valley Jungle&N~
   Scars along the burnt out trunk clearly show that this tree was once struck
by lightning.  It has never recovered, standing here only to rot and become a
support for all the vines that wish to stretch their way higher into the
heavens.  A number of smaller trees stand around, but they are slowly being
smothered by the vines, some of which are now thicker than many trees.  A close
look at the tree itself shows that some opportunist has somehow made its way
through the vines to create a burrow in the trunk of the rotting tree, a burrow
carefully protected by the vines themselves.

river to the west has nowhere else to go.  Soft eddies brush against the banks
here before heading back out to the west.  A soft spray flies in from the wide
waterfall west of here, creating hundreds of tiny rainbows during the daylight
hours.  The rough rock of the cliff to the north is quite unclimbable, though
the jungle vines and plants have done their very best to overcome the
unyielding stone.  The jungle heads deeper into darkness to the east and

&+gNear a &+rJodani&N &+yWood Wall&+g Deep in the Jungle&N~
   A tall, seamless, jodani wood wall stands to the west, extending northward
to meet the face of the cliff.  The wall itself extends upward at least forty
feet, and the canopy near the wall has been trimmed or sheared back somehow to
prevent creatures getting over the wall through the trees.  Jodani wood is
known for its strength, and resistance to magic, as well as its expense.
Seamless joined together somehow, this magical wood has clearly been polished
and protected with magical means.  Despite its strength and beauty, it is clear
that creatures have attacked the wall, there are four long burn marks where
someone tried to burn their way through, and several pockmarks from spears or
arrows of some sort.  It is difficult to say how old the damage is, but the
nearby jungle shows no scars of recent battles suggesting they are at least a
few months old, if not older.

   Moisture in the air makes sounds difficult to follow, sometimes quenching
them in the wet ground and thick vegetation, sometimes making them carry for
miles.  The sound of a lone flutist can be heard here, the sound floats on the
stinking, humid air like a soft feather.  Peaceful music can't overcome the
gloom here though, the darkness is so overcoming here that one wonders why the
bromeliards growing on some of the tree roots bother having any color, when
there is no light for them to be seen.  They do have color however, bright reds
and purples that struggle vainly to push back the darkness of the jungle which
extends in every direction.

   An opening through the massive jodani tree to the north is clearly being
used as the gateway into a village or town of some sort.  Tall jodani wood
walls flow seamlessly from the sides of the tree to extend to the northwest and
southeast where they must meet the steep cliffs that surround this dark jungle
valley.  The wall itself is quite a spectacle, made entirely of jodani wood
magically melded together so that no gaps or junctions can be seen in the wall
itself.  Jodani trees are only found in the Rift Valley Jungle, and very rare
outside of the halfling town of Woodseer.  Wood from the tree to the north
could be used to build houses for entire cities, here though it has clearly
been used to create a gateway to help protect a village from the rest of the
jungle.

leaping, or falling over the wall into whatever lies beyond.  The jungle

the stench and oppressive humidity of the jungle as it extends in every other

The only flowers that can be seen here are small epiphytic plants that hang off
the sides of the tall tree trunks.  Though these few flowers are quite
beautiful, they do nothing to alleviate the overpowering aroma of the rotting
humus that lines the jungle floor.

cling to the rocks, as well as the many trees that stand here.  Even strong,
magical lights can't provide enough illumination to get a good estimate of how
high up the lower canopy of the jungle really is.  It is clear however, that
the canopy gathers all the light that hits it, refusing to let even a shred of

fungi have found a way to grow down here on the jungle floor, most are small
though, and subsist on the life juices of the trees and vines that have found a
way to reach upward to the life-giving sunlight.  The small flowers and
mushrooms that dot the exposed roots and trunks of the trees here add bright
splashes of color to the otherwise colorless world beneath the jungle canopy
above.  Where there are plants there are animals, from tiny poisonous frogs to
massive tigers, and insects that vary from tiny gnats to unspeakable freaks of
nature and magic.  The jungle continues to the north and west.

light down to the jungle floor, making it relatively easy to travel through.
Dense jungle growth described in bard's tales is really only at the edges of
the jungle, where light can pass through to the ground.  It is clear that the
fancy bards that sing such tales have never truly experienced the deep jungle.
Tree trunks stretch into the heavens, as do various lianas and vines that cling
to them as they make their own way upward.  Various parasitic flowers cling to
the lianas and tree trunks adding color for those actually able to see in this
paralyzing darkness.

   The simple word 'darkness' has a new meaning here.  Strange odors, mixtures
of the rot and decay of the jungle floor and the sweet smelling flowers that
dot even this gloomy area, add the scent and taste of mystery to the darkness.
Cries of animals seep through the humid air, some familiar, others so spine-
tingling that they reach down into one's soul and tickle at some primal,
unidentifiable fear.  Though some vague light does reach the down this far
when the sun is at its highest, it simply creates more shades of darkness to
cloak the creatures that travel here.  Bards sing tales of lost cities, and
great adventures in places like this, but the tales of this jungle are few, and
it is easy to see why, few are hearty enough to withstand a darkness such as
this.

   Someone has stripped all the vines away from the southern face of a large
osage tree here.  On the barren face of the tree a delicate carving has been
started.  Though unfinished, the craftsmanship is remarkable, far beyond the
talents of a normal woodworker.  Few creatures appear to venture here, seeming
to almost deliberately shy away from the area, making it seem deceptively quiet
and safe.

The delicate carving shows a human figure walking along an eerie landscape of
clouds and rocks that seem suspended in air.  A dragon has been carved over the
human figure in faint thin lines.  Every line in the carving appears to be
quite deliberate.  Osage is a hard wood, a sharp blade must have been used to
create such fine lines and smooth gradations.  If the carving weren't in the
face of a living tree it could bring a decent fee in any civilized city.

   A massive slab of granite thrusts its way through the jungle floor here.
Something about the rock itself seems magical, it has withstood all the jungles
assaults upon its barren face, something not even the cliffs that surround this
valley can claim.  Even more surprising, someone has taken the time to make a
delicate carving in the face of the rock itself, work that was clearly done
quite recently because chips of stone lie on top of the jungle humus, not
having had time to be covered up.  The carving itself has an eloquence and
artistry that speaks of true mastery, leading one to wonder why someone would
waste their time carving a stone that few, if any, will every see.

   In some nearby spots the jungle canopy lets through enough light to grow
some spectacular plants, here though, the plants rely on those above them to
supply them with nutrients.  Several large bromeliards lie on the jungle floor
here, spreading their massive petals to create small pools of water that
provide life to many other creatures in the forest.  Most of the creatures here
feed on the rotting leaves, branches, and fruit that have fallen from the
canopy above, others feed on each other or on the living trees themselves.
Yes, in the deep jungle even plants are parasites, and predators, in the combat
for survival no trick shall remain unused.

   A patch of drying blood adds a coppery tang to the stagnant stench of the
rotting humus.  Whatever creature left the blood here doesn't appear to have
put up much of a struggle, in fact there are no signs of a struggle at all.
Vine shrouded tree trunks of various types rise upward, stretching toward the
canopy that roofs in the jungle, blocking out all light.  Several small
epiphytic flowers hang from the vines and trees, adding small splashes of color
to the darkness.  Jungles are strange places, sometimes absorbing sound, other
times allowing it to echo through the moist air.  This space seems quite
peaceful, yet the slowly drying blood suggests that a swift and merciless death
can pounce upon the unwary.

   Soggy quicksand sucks at all that pass this point in the jungle, slowing
them for any predator swift enough to take advantage of their situation.
Fortunately, there is some solid ground a few feet below the surface of the
quicksand allowing travelers to slog their way through it until they reach
higher ground.  Small creatures caught in the quicksand are doomed, and larger
ones simple become easier bait for predators as they attempt to climb out of
the quicksand.

&+WA Prison of Air&N~
   It appears that this is some strange prison, created right out of the
elemental plane of air.  Transparent, but solid, walls block any route to
other parts of the plane, created by some ancient and powerful magic.  An
odd winding cord of light hangs in mid-air.  The cord appears to have been
looped around something and then attached to the invisible walls.  Whatever
spells have been worked here are ancient, but powerful.  The magical barriers
appear to be ready to withstand several more thousand years before they begin
to even slightly weaken.  A strange glowing plane of light stands along the
barrier to the west, though what it is or why it is here is a mystery.

   Tongues of flame lick against everything here, some great mage has somehow
trapped a piece of the elemental plane of fire here.  The heat is unbearable,
and its source seems limitless, whatever magic has been worked here is ancient
and of a power virtually unseen in the rest of the vast world of Duris.  It is
one thing to create an ever-burning fire, but altogether different to trap a
piece of an elemental plane here in this world all by itself.  It appears that
a number of hand and foot-holds would allow one to climb out of this burning
prison to return to the much cooler jungle.

&+yDeep Withing a Bowl of Swirling Earth&N~
   The thought of the power required to create this strange prison is enough
to make even the brave shiver in fear and awe.  And a prison it appears to be,
Burning metal chains float throughout the swirling mud and rock, they either
once held something here, or do still now, the swirling liquid earth is
difficult to see through.  A great and powerful mage was required to trap the
very essence of the elemental plane of earth here within the bowl, the thought
of acquiring such power would send most mages to drooling.  The magic used
here is quite ancient though, undoubtedly almost as old as the jungle valley
itself.  Handholds in the side of the bowl mark a clear route down so that
anyone foolish enough to dive into the bowl in the first place can still make
their way out.

   Water swirls in vicious eddies, colliding off the sides of the bowl.  An
odd taste to the water suggests that it is far from normal, and its coolness
means that some magic has been used to preserve it here.  Fortunately, the
bowl is not large enough to create currents that would prevent one from
climbing out of it.  Oddly enough, the bowl appears to be at least four times
as large on the inside as on the outside, a more than disconcerting fact for
the adventurer that is unable to swim.

Birds flit by unseen, more heard and sensed than actually seen in the darkness
and the cries of other animals can be heard in the canopy high above.  Vines

of ebonwood itself it barely fills the doorway.  The only thing truly hiding
it from view is its height above the jungle floor, few animals are intelligent
enough to find or even open such a door.  Vines circling the ebonwood itself
allow a fairly safe climb down its long, thick trunk.

all intents and purposes the room appears to be abandoned, or at least not used
very often.  A small bookcase along the western wall contains only dust, and a
chest at the foot of the bed stands open, containing only an old blanket.  An
opening in the floor shows a ladder leading down to a second room.

really have any sort of value.  The room itself is dry and fairly cool, quite
unlike the room above or the jungle outside probably due to the protection of

traveler can climb through the branches to get a better look at the many
different animals and birds that have made their homes here.  Not only do the
trees show their leaves, but flowers and fruits of every imaginable shape and
color hang from tree limbs everywhere.  Despite the presence of trees
everywhere, they are often thin and have no branches except here at the level
of the canopy, making them impossible to climb down.  The birds, and even some

&+GTraveling Through the Jungle Canopy&N~
   Branches, vines, and leaves of hundreds of different plants extend in every
direction.  At some points the interwoven canopy is so thick that a careful
traveler can climb through the branches to get a better look at the many
different animals and birds that have made their homes here.  Not only do the
trees show their leaves, but flowers and fruits of every imaginable shape and
color hang from tree limbs everywhere.  Despite the presence of trees
everywhere, they are often thin and have no branches except here at the level
of the canopy, making them impossible to climb down.  The birds, and even some
of the monkeys and other animals, are almost as brightly colored as the flowers
and fruits.  It is almost as if all the color was drained from the dark jungle
floor below and splashed about at random, in fits of mad painting to create a
symphony of colors.

&+GAn Odd Jungle Home&N~
   Growth of the plants here has clearly been influenced by either powerful
magic or by someone with the ability and patience to make plants grow in only
certain directions.  Thick vines and tree branches lace together to form an
almost completely solid flooring as well as rising up around this area on all
sides as what can only be called walls.  There is no ceiling, this area is
completely open to the sky, but it is clear that someone or something makes
their home here.

&+GA &+LMonkey&+G Hideaway&N~
   A massive tribe of large monkeys has made this their main home, probably
because there are so many fruit bearing trees nearby.  It is also interesting
to note that there are a number of small branches that extend a bit higher
here, giving some slight protection from the vicious monkey-eating harpy eagles
that hunt throughout the jungle canopy.  The monkeys are smart enough to put
out sentinels to warn of approaching eagles, but one wonders how much good this
can really do against such formidable hunters.

   Once standing even higher above the canopy, a tree here has been broken off,
shattered even.  Splinters of wood and dead branches lie about, caught in the
thick jungle canopy.  The broken end of the tree looks as though it was hit by
lightning, punished for daring to thrust above the surrounding canopy to steal
even more sunlight.  A close inspection reveals that part of the broken off end
has been hollowed out and turned into some sort of nest.

   This part of the burrow is a bit deeper and larger than the rest of it.  In
fact this appears to be the main living quarters of whatever creatures live
here.  Small depressions along the sides of the burrow are tucked in against
the roots that stretch downward from above.  These depressions appear to be
sleeping areas of some sort, but they are filled with muddy water and would
seem to be incredibly uncomfortable.  The muddy burrow continues to the north.

entryway.  A stone stairway heads down into dark hard-packed earth and stone,
heading deep beneath the jungle.  Roots end only a bit further into the earth
because the roots of jungle trees don't need to seek deep into the earth for
water or nutrients because they are easily found this close to the surface.

natural, being made of hard-packed clay and stone.  As the hallway continues to
the south it meets another stairway that has been lit with a number of freshly
burning torches.  Dripping water echoes throughout the short hallway as water
seeps through the wood panels that hold up the ceiling, but the water barely
dampens the floor, somehow soaking into the hard clay.

as to be worth transporting through the humid jungle.  In fact, some of the
paintings and other decorations have clearly been damaged by the water that has
found a way to seep through the wooden walls and ceiling.  Wood panels line all
the walls, providing support for the paneled ceiling.  Hanging lanterns and
torches along the walls keep everything here brightly lit.

   This carefully hidden room contains a number of valuable treasures stored by
the infamous 'Juaraldo'.  Juaraldo is wanted in almost every civilized city for
thievery and murder.  It seems that he is quite unlike many 'true' thieves, he
prefers to kill all of his victims rather than leaving them alive and
penniless.  It is also rumored that he has done a great deal of paid
assassination, though like all rumors, the truth is hard to find.  Swords, rugs
and other treasures have been randomly stacked in every corner of the room.
Unfortunately, little care has been given to these once valuable treasures and
seeping water has done a great deal of damage.

many soft leaves that have been brought in to pad the burrow, whatever lives
here must collect shiny things to bury here.  It is doubtful there is anything
of value, just shiny stones that can be found in the nearby river.  The burrow
itself has been dug beneath a dead and rotting tree.  Vines surround the
burrow, clinging to the remains of the dead tree and effectively concealing it
from outside predators,

color hang from tree limbs everywhere.  Despite the presence of trees
everywhere, they are often thin and have no branches except here at the level
of the canopy, making them impossible to climb down.  The birds, and even some

everywhere, they are often thin and have no branches except here at the level
of the canopy, making them impossible to climb down.  The birds, and even some

and fruits.  It is almost as if all the color was drained from the dark jungle

&+yA Tiny Room Inside a &+rJodani&N &+yTree&N~
   A small chair and table fill almost the entire room.  A lantern has been
hung from one of the walls but it clearly hasn't been lit in many years.  Thick
layers of dust cling to everything, this place hasn't been occupied in a very
long time.  An empty mug sitting on the table suggests that perhaps this place
was left unoccupied rather suddenly, leaving no time to pack or clean.  A
second small room has been hollowed out of the trunk to the east and a small
door leads back out to the side of the tree

&+yA Tiny Bedroom Inside a &+rJodani&N &+yTree&N~
   The tiny bed tucked into the corner was left unmade and untended long ago.
Dust covers the blankets and sheets, and a pile of old, rotting clothing lies
beneath it.  Whoever lived here must have left one day and simply never
returned, leaving all their belongings behind.  An old staff leans against one
wall, splintered and useless due to its age and several empty lanterns hang
from pegs on the walls.  The job of carving these rooms out of the heart of the
tree must have been tedious, it is surprising that anyone would abandon such
hard work so easily.

&+LA Dark, Wet Burrow&N~
   This burrow is tight, but deep.  Deep enough that water seeps out of the
soil into its bottom.  Moist soil smells strongly of the humus of the jungle,
the rotting material that supports all life within it.  A faint, musky odor
seems to be layered on the standard jungle smells, perhaps the scent of
whatever lives here.  Something glitters briefly in the bottom of the burrow,
but whether a simple reflection off some water or a hidden bauble caused the
flash remains to be determined.

&+LBeside an Underground &+bLake&N~
   Well-worn by the passage of many feet, this shore has been crossed many
times.  Old nets have been left here to rot, holed and useless it must have
been easier to create new nets than to fix those that were abandoned.  The
ceiling is lower here than out over the lake to the south, but the stalactites
have been broken away making it easy for even the largest barbarian to stand
upright.  Several of the broken stalactites have been made into crude benches
that fishermen must clearly relax on while casting their nets.

   Eerie purple light cast by the mosses and algae over the lake barely
illuminates this area, leaving the walls to the back hidden mostly in shadows.
Stalactites from the low ceiling here have been broken off and turned into
crude benches along the shore of the lake to the west.  Small hooks, bits of
torn netting, and thin fishing lines have been abandoned here, mostly useless
and broken.  Several fresh, wet footprints near the shoreline indicate that
someone, or something, still fishes here, and that they may be nearby

   The rocky shoreline within the cavern bends west and south here around a
natural stone pillar that stands at the corner of the lake to the southwest.
The eerie purple light from the floating mosses and algae in the lake barely
illuminates this area.  Abandoned fishing gear and clear signs of recent
travelers are easy to see even in the dim light, others have certainly been
here, and quite recently.

   Darkness has swallowed this narrow cavern, eliminating all but the roughest

   The ceiling is only ten feet or so above here, extending further to the

south.  Moisture hangs in the air, clinging to the walls of the cavern and even
the cave that leads off to the north.  Broken remains of the stalactites that
once hung from the ceiling lie cast about, showing that someone has gone
through a great deal of effort to remove all the stalactites in the area.

   Heading generally north and south, the jagged walls make it almost
impossible to see what is in either direction.  It is warm here, not as warm as
the jungle perhaps, but easily as humid.  Close inspection of the cave floor
shows that a number of feet pass by here regularly.  Another small cave can be
seen to the east, an opening into a cavern of some sort is to the south and the
cave continues to the north.

   The furniture here, though crude, is a clear sign that intelligent creatures
live here.  The lizardmen that live in these caves and caverns are clearly far
more intelligent than most such creatures one can encounter, yet they remain
hidden here in the caves, venturing out into the jungle only at night.  This
room is clearly a family dwelling of some type, enough bedding lies along the
southern wall to indicate that quite a large group of lizardmen must live here.

another different cave climbs almost straight upward from here with a slight
angle to the west.  The well-worn cave floor and broken stalactites are clear

   Paintings adorn every face of the cavern, even the roughest parts of the
walls have been painted with extracts from various jungle flowers.  Most of the
artwork is abstract, made up of interlocked circles, squares, and triangles of
various colors.  Some parts of the walls show startlingly realistic portrayals
of lizardmen and elves at war, or lizardmen fighting some of the creatures of
the jungle.  It is clear that the artist has great skill and knowledge of just
which blends of colors to use.  Additional caverns extend to the north and east
and a small cave opening is to the west.

&+LA Huge Family Cavern&N~
   This massive family cavern clearly houses a majority of the lizardmen that
make their homes within the caves.  Curtains of woven jungle leaves have been
hung in several to separate different family areas.  All the stalactites have
been broken away from the ceiling above.  The broken stalactites have been used
to create a number of benches that surround a central altar of some sort in the
middle of the cave.  Various pieces of poorly made furniture dot the area,
looking more like they have been moved roughly aside rather than placed in any
particular spot.

   Several lizardman fishermen must live here, carefully woven nets hang from
pegs an the walls and even the ceiling.  Posts in the center of the room have
been erected, extending up to the high ceiling in this cave.  It appears that
the posts serve more as a place to hang more nets and fishing gear rather than
in any supporting role for the ceiling, in fact one of the posts is leaning at
an odd angle, standing only because it is wedged between the ceiling and the
floor.  Blankets lie in a variety of different spots on the floor marking the
sleeping spots of the lizardmen that live here.

&+LA Sloping Cave&N~
   A steep, well-traveled incline here leads into other caverns.  It is clear
that there must be a network of caverns hidden here inside the mountains,
though how many lizardmen might be hidden here is a mystery.  Rough stone lines
the walls but the steep floor has been worn smooth by the passage of many feet.
Water clings to the walls, though it is cooler than the jungle these caves are
hidden from, the humidity is thick and cloying, leaving moisture on the cool
stone walls as a sign of its presence.  The cave climbs up slightly to the west
and drops steeply downward to the east.

Moisture clings to the rough stone, making it less painful to brush against but
by no means providing any comfort.  It is only slightly cooler here than in the
jungle above, but certainly just as humid and uncomfortable.

   Caves lead off to the north, south and west, but it is to dark in any of

smooth by the passing of many feet, and clearly still sees heavy use.  Water is
present everywhere, not in pools but in the air and clinging to the walls in a
wet, glossy film.  Strange odors seem to ooze in through the cave entrance to
the west.

&+LThe Shaman's Home&N~
   A rickety ebonwood bench stands along the western wall loaded with stone
mortars and pestles and various other implements.  Clay jars full of dried
leaves and flowers have been set beneath the bench.  The jars clearly have been
placed in a particular order, though exactly what is in each jar is very
difficult to identify.  A long bed is in the middle of the room and several
blankets lie on the floor beside it.  One would guess that this is where the
lizardman shaman practices his rituals to heal the sick and injured.

   Caves lead away into darkness to the north, east and upward.  Faint flashes
of light through the narrow entrance to the east signal that someone or
something may be there.  There is little movement of air through these caves,
leaving a stale, foul smell in the air.  It is interesting to note that all the
stalactites throughout these caves have been painstakingly broken down from the
ceiling, the reasons for this remain somewhat unclear.

&+LA Family Dwelling&N~
   This small family cave has been left in complete disarray, most likely due
to the small lizardmen children that must sleep on the tiny beds lined up
against the northern wall.  Lizardmen aren't terribly fertile, but when they
have a brood it does tend to be quite large.  A number of hunting spears have
been lined up against the southern wall, ready for immediate use and a set of
partially completed alligatorskin armor hangs from a rack in the back of the
room.

   The cave is so steep here that it is hard to keep one's footing.  A slick
coating of water clinging to the walls and floor of the cave are of no
assistance either.  The rock is cooler than the air and draws the moisture out
of the humid air.  Easy to defend due to its steep grade and narrow confines,
it is easy to see why the lizardmen have made their homes here.  Only the
insane, or those with a death wish, would dare to make war upon them in these
caves and caverns.

   The cave appears to come to a dead-end here, blocked by rubble and broken

here, perhaps the lizardman guards must patrol into this small area as well.  A
stone bench rests out of the way in a niche to the south, indicating that, if
nothing else, guards must pause here to rest.

   Stone benches stand against the walls ready for the guards that must stay
here to protect the entrance to the lizardman caves.  Marks on one of the walls
show that bored guards must engage in contests of spear and dagger throwing to
pass the time.  Racks line the walls, full of spears and thin javelins as well
as clubs and other weapons.  Despite the crude work on the benches and the
walls, it is clear that the lizardmen take special care of their weapons for
these are the tools of their survival.

&+LHome of the &+gLizardman Chieftain&N~
   Elven shields and longbows dot the wall, trophies from battle no doubt.  It
is evident that the lizardman that lives here is of very high stature.  A bed
with a real mattress, and even sheets, stands against one wall and captured
tapestries dot several of the other walls.  Lizardmen tend to display their
wealth rather than hide it, and if this room is any indication the hides of the
more powerful jungle creatures are extremely valuable.  The skin of a coatl has
been used to line a throne-like chair and the scales of a green dragon have
been piled to one side.  Several tiger skins have been used to create soft
pillows and the bones of a number of elves have been turned into disgusting
statues that decorate a number of small tables lining the walls.  These
decorations alone show how powerful the lizardman chieftain is, and this
strength is what has made him the tribal leader.

&+gBefore Some Village Gates&N~
   This entryway has a certain forbidding quality to it, not due to its
sturdiness but rather the gloomy swamp that lies beyond.  Bullywugs have made a
village here, and despite their evil, the nearby halflings are unwilling to
risk fighting them on their own ground.  The moist swamp is their true home and
the bullywugs will do anything to defend it.  Even without the uneasy truce
with the halflings the rickety gates would likely stand as wide open as they
are now.  The gates and fence simply provide markers of what the bullywugs
consider their territory.

   Gates to this this swampy village can be seen to the south, the only opening
in a lengthy, but rickety fence that surrounds the village.  Mud and sticky
moss cling to boots with every step that is taken.  Each footfall squelches,
and the gooey sound streaks through the humid air, only to run up against one
of the nearby trees and die.  The bullywugs appear to be able to move through
the thick mud with soundless ease, showing that this really is their true
domain.  Muddy trails extend to the north and west and the village gates are to
the south.

   One of the many muddy trails through the bullywug village, this area is
lined with rotting refuse and stinks of garbage.  The swamp and surrounding
jungle swallow almost all trash, but the smell tends to hang in the humid air
for an eternity.  Small huts have been built throughout the area, some on
stilts, some clinging to the exposed roots of the large swamp mangroves.  None
of the huts is much to look at, if the trees weren't so thick a simple gust of
wind would knock most of them into pieces.

   The bullywug shaman works in this hut with several of his assistants, when
he can find them that is.  Clay vials and bottles of herbs and spices have been
organized on shelves along the eastern wall.  Beds and cots line the other
walls and a narrow doorway leads into a tiny room to the east.  The beds are
for patients as well as for the shaman's assistants.  The village shaman is one
of the most powerful bullywugs in the village, and the expense of his
decorations and the fact that nobody has attempted to steal them is a testament

&+GThe Village Shaman's Sleeping Room&N~
   It is clear that the village shaman is far more intelligent and organized
than the bullywug villagers.  He is also far wealthier, the chairs and desk in
this small hut are clearly crafted by some of the finest halfling woodworkers,
and must have cost a small ransom, most halflings won't deal with bullywugs.
An ebonwood bed stands in the corner, and a tiny lacewood dresser with a broken
leg has been propped up next to it.  The room is so small that the furniture
makes it almost impossible to move, but at the same time it has a certain
elegance that is surprising considering the surroundings.

&+yA Muddy Trail&N~
   The squelching steps one takes seem loud in the humid confines of the swamp,
but in reality the sound can not travel far.  Thick reeds, and trees of every
variety soak up the sound, leaving an eerie silence that can be most
disconcerting at times.  Bullywugs travel to and fro, seemingly unconcerned by
intruders.  The muddy trail continues to the east and west, a fence lies to the
south and the wall of a small hut blocks the way north.

&+yThe Southwest Corner&N~
   The fence to the south and west marks the boundary of the bullywug
territory.  Though bullywugs do often hunt in the jungle itself, the fence
marks the village that they will defend with a ferocity that has prevented all
attacks from the nearby halflings.  Muddy trails follow the fence to the west
toward the village gates and to the north along some huts to finally reach the
cliffs that enclose the Rift Vally Jungle.

   The muddy trail heads north and south here, passing in front of a tilted hut
to the east.  The hut was originally built on stilts but the stilts have sunk
into the mud.  Unfortunately, the stilts supporting the southern end of the hut
have sunk in further than those to the north making the hut lean noticeably to
one side.

&+YA Hunter's Hut&N~
   Fishing nets and hunting gear line the walls of this hut.  Built on low
stilts, the stilts to the south have sunk into the swamp a bit giving a
noticeable tilt to the hut, one that makes the gaps in the poorly laid wooden
floor even more obvious.  Nets drape down from hooks on the northern wall,
giving an almost humorous note to the tilt of the hut.  Few of the wooden
spears or other implements seem to be of any decent quality, but then what of
the bullywug products is?  The western doorway exits directly to one of the
many muddy trails that winds through the entire town.

&+yA Muddy Trail&N~
   One of the many muddy trails through the bullywug village, this area is
lined with rotting refuse and stinks of garbage.  The swamp and surrounding
jungle swallow almost all trash, but the smell tends to hang in the humid air
for an eternity.  Small huts have been built throughout the area, some on
stilts, some clinging to the exposed roots of the large swamp mangroves.  None
of the huts is much to look at, if the trees weren't so thick a simple gust of
wind would knock most of them into pieces.  A frail hut lies to the east and
the trail continues to the north and south.

&+GA Bullywug Home&N~
   This family dwelling stinks of waste and rotting food.  Like all bullywugs,
the family living here has no sense of cleanliness or decor.  An overflowing
clay chamber pot is in the northeast corner and a series of small pallets lies
along the western wall.  There are no chairs or tables here, the bullywugs must
simply squat or sit on the wood floor, and the lack of any cooking implements
suggests they must eat their food raw.

&+yBeside a Cliff on a Muddy Trail&N~
   The fence to the west ends at the face of the cliff to the north, and the
trail bends along the rocky face to head eastward.  The cliff itself is jagged
and rough, rain water doesn't penetrate the canopy above with enough force to
wear it down.  This is one of the jagged cliffs that encloses the Rift Valley
Jungle.  This area is a bit lower than the rest of the jungle, and the rocky
cliffs help force the ground to retain the water that makes this region so
swampy and forbidding.

&+yA Juncture of Muddy Paths&N~
   Muddy trails extend to the north, east, and west.  To the west several muddy
trails pass beneath roots and small huts that have been built upon low stilts.
The dense, humid air is laden with mosquitoes and the stench of rotting
garbage.  Bullywugs travel through the paths with graceful ease, somehow
traversing the mud without making any sound.  The bullywugs themselves aren't
really much larger than halflings, but walk with a distinctive waddling gait.

&+yBeneath a Large Hut&N~
   The mud and water are actually fairly deep here, making it easy to see why
the hut above was built on stilts in the first place.  Garbage of all sorts
floats around in the water, adding its rotting stench to the dank air.  Insects
float about in clouds, searching for food so that they may mate and lay even
more eggs to infest this vile swamp.  An open door leads into the hut that has
been built above, the hut looks quite large, though poorly made, and could
easily hold a large number of bullywugs or other creatures.

water, though a particularly heavy rain might still flood it a bit.  The
bullywugs love the moisture though, that is why they have made their homes
here.

several of the bullywug warriors and hunters live here.  A number of spears and
clubs lie around in various states of disrepair.  Many of the finer clubs and
spears have been lined with sharpened bones or stones, but none of them is of
high quality workmanship.  The bones that decorate the walls have been carved
into the shapes of various jungle animals, several of the carvings are actually
quite good but most are rather poorly done.  An open trapdoor leads back down

been used to support the hut and keep it out of the swamp, and equally heavy
wood has been used in the construction of the floor and walls.  A powerful odor
drips downward from above, the horribly unpleasant aroma of a tanner's.  The
stench is so powerful that it even overcomes the smell of the rotting garbage
and decaying vegetation

   Stinking vats filled with mysterious solutions are being used to treat a
wide variety of animal skins.  Although Reiwiggy is clearly not willing to
sell his work to any non-bullywugs it is quite possible that he might trade for
additional products.  Unfinished suits of leather armor stand on racks
throughout the hut, some of plain skins, others of tiger or alligator skin.
Reiwiggy clearly has an artistic ability and talent with leather that none of
the other bullywugs possesses.

   Muddy trails like this one snake through the village in every direction.  At
times the trails pass beneath huts or roots that reach out of the muddy ground,
but all the pathways stink of the rot and decay of the swamp combined with the
waste the bullywugs create and simply toss out of their doors.  Even the
youngest of the bullywugs that marches around the village has a certain hatred
and anger in their eyes, though it is relatively safe here, it is no surprise
that villagers attack visitors seemingly at random.

   The muddy trail is forced to the east here as the cliff to the west bends
sharply east cutting off any travel north.  Though the canopy above blocks any
view, it is easy to predict that this cliff must be one of those that encloses
the Rift Valley Jungle, and likely rises up to a height of 500 feet or more.
The jagged rock would be nearly impossible to climb even if it weren't coated
with moisture deposited by the humid jungle air.

   A closed trapdoor leads up into the massive hut that can only be the
chieftain's.  It is probably unwise to bother him, not even the bullywug
villagers can be seen entering very often.  A wide, muddy path leads south
through the main part of the village and a narrow trail leads westward along
the cliff.  The hut itself looks fairly sturdy, with the northern part of the
building wedged against the rocky walls of the cliff to the north and the rest

line the wall, along with several tiger skins, it would appear that the
chieftain has come into power by his skill at hunting and fighting alone.
Several metal shields and even a suit of armor also decorate the room,
further testament to the chief's fighting skill.  The armor and shields
appear to be decorations only though, neither are practical in the sticky

that it is difficult to even notice the second room that lies further to the
north.  The halfling, human, and other visitors here have a dark nature to
them, one that fits in well with the evil tendencies of the bullywugs.
Bullywugs have no friends though, they are willing to kill for almost any
reason, and drunken bullywugs are the angriest sort.

bullywugs far outnumber any of the other visitors, making them very cautious
not to anger anyone.  Drunken bullywugs are a sickening sight, their waddling
bodies lose all grace upon the land in the first place, their drunkenness just
makes it worse.  In addition, drunken bullywugs are even more likely to attack
others at random, it is not unheard of for bullywugs to get into a fight that
lasts until they both pass out.

&+yA Muddy Trail&N~
   Mosquitoes and biting flies swarm about the area making life truely
unpleasant.  The vast quantities of water that lie about in stagnant pools
provide breeding areas for the insects as well as for some of the fish and
animals the bullywugs live on.  There is a small bullywug home to the north,
one that is far more sturdy than any others in the village.  Someone either
powerful, or simply more intelligent than their fellow villagers must live
within.

&+GA Bullywug Hut&N~
   This home is far more sturdy and well-decorated than perhaps even the
chief's hut.  Silver plates have been hung from the walls and several long
spears lean against the doorway.  This hut must hold the family of a great
hunter for there is a large number of sleeping pallets pushed to one side and a
number of hunting trophies have been hung from the walls.  A wooden desk, which
is clearly unused, stands in one corner as a sign of the wealth of the owner of
this home.  The door to the hut has been broken open and never fixed, it
appears the owner has no fear of thieves.

&+yA Curve Along the Village Fence&N~
   The muddy trail bends from west to north here as it follows along the fence.
Further to the north a wide, murky pool of water can be seen, as well as a
number of bullywugs that appear to be soaking in it.  Despite the high humidity
the bullywugs need to keep their skins moist by bathing in such pools quite
often.  The sound of a distant waterfall echoes through the trees, its exact
source almost impossible to determine.

&+yA Muddy Trail&N~
   One of the many muddy trails through the bullywug village, this area is
lined with rotting refuse and stinks of garbage.  The swamp and surrounding
jungle swallow almost all trash, but the smell tends to hang in the humid air
for an eternity.  The bullywugs not only endure the stench but they must even
enjoy it.  There is a massive pool of murky water to the north that many
bullywugs, especially the young, can be swimming in.  It is quite likely that
anyone intruding upon their private pool may be attacked so caution should be
used by anyone thinking about entering it.

&+yWithin a &+rJodani&N &+yTree&N~
   This tall, narrow passage cuts through the Jodani tree to enter a small
village of wild-elves to the north.  It is clear that the passage has been made
deliberately narrow so only one person can make it through at a time.  A
lantern suspended high above reveals the lustrous red wood grain and careful
craftsmanship of the entryway.  The tight quarters and humid air make the
strong aroma of the wood almost overpowering.  Gates flanking either side of
the passageway are drawn up out of view from the outside.  Small holes in the
roof of the passage indicate that there is another room above.  In the event of
an attack, guards in the room above must be able to drop the gates to close off
the village and trap anyone foolish enough to still be in the passageway.

&+GInside the Gates to Moonhollow&N~
   A village of wild-elves has been carefully constructed here, deep inside the
Rift Valley Jungle.  These elves are far more sturdy and muscular than their
more well-protected brethren in more distant lands.  Life in the Rift Valley
Jungle is brutal, leaving only the strong and wise to survive for long.  The
elves allow visitors, though they clearly aren't very trusting.  A narrow
passageway leads out of the village through a massive jodani tree to the south.
Flawless jodani wood walls extend south and west from the tree to meet the
large cliffs that enclose the Rift Valley Jungle.  Moss-lined paths wind off to
the east and west passing through and around a variety of ebonwood and jodani
trees.

A narrow passageway through a huge Jodani tree is the only way to get

great deal of magic was used in its creation.

&+yA Meeting of Paths&N~
   The narrow pathway is well shaded by some large ebonwood trees to the north
and the tall jodani wood wall to the southwest.  It is clear from this side of
the wall that it is extremely thick and well made.  Light reflects off the
highly polished wall with a faint red hue, it is easy to see why jodani wood is
so valuable, and easy to be impressed by the cost of its creation.  There is a
narrow walkway along the top of the wall that is about forty feet off the
ground.  Voices of elven children seem to rain down from the trees to the east
and north.  An extremely narrow pathway leads east past a large boulder toward
the trunks of several ebonwood trees and the path continues to the south, east,
and west and a large ebonwood tree stands to the north.

walkway on the jodani wall, are home to a number of small colorful birds
and squirrels.  The lower branches of the trees in the area are about
fifty to sixty feet above the ground, yet people, probably elves, can be
seen moving across them.

south of here where a long ladder leads up to the walkway that traverses the
wall high above.  Tree branches extend from the north to shade this area,
providing both shade and protection from the elements.  Enough of the normal
jungle undergrowth has been cleared away that faint breezes stir the air,
sometimes bringing the sounds of elven voices along with them.

tree that makes the entrance to Moonhollow and north into an opening in
the cliff face.  It is easy to see over the wall here toward the jungle.
The area immediately before the wall has been cleared of most heavy
jungle growth to prevent anyone from approaching unseen, and to prevent
the jungle vines and trees from growing high enough to make the wall
worthless defensively.  Trees inside the wall have also been trimmed
back so that opposing wizards can't use them in anyway to attack the
wall.  Openings have been made at regular intervals along the wall to
allow archers a clear range of fire.  The walkway continues to the
north and a cave can be seen to the south.

faces out toward the doorway from the eastern wall, and several Jodani wood
bookcases occupy the northeastern corner.  Near the bookcases is a leather
upholstered reading chair and a small lamp.  A marble shelf along the southern
wall holds many beautiful trinkets that have been given to Moonstone as gifts.
There are no exits but an open doorway to the east that leads back to the

elves are at their closest point here, making this a perfect spot for a
protective wall.  The trees inside Moonhollow have had their branches trimmed
back away from the wall so that opposing wizards can not use them against the
wall itself.  Openings have been placed along the length of the wall for
archers and to give wizards a clear field of view.

that patrol Moonhollow make their quarters here.  Two sets of triple bunk beds
line the northern wall.  Armor and robes have been neatly hung on pegs near the
door and the head of each bunk bed has a built in slot to hang weapons for quick
and easy access.  The dark ebonwood walls and floor have been left plain,
though everything has been kept extremely clean.  A small dinner table of
stands in the center of the room, and a rarely used kitchen is in the southeast

to make a majority of the building and a thin line of green granite
about four feet above the ground seems to split it into halves.  The
open doorway to the south is framed with a light pink stone of some
sort.  The pounding of a blacksmith's hammer can be heard from within
the building, along with the wheeze of a bellows.  The lose stones line

Teglaron's Armory~
   Teglaron, a dwarven blacksmith, moved here some time ago to set up his own
shop.  His skill, and temper are known throughout the area, but his reasons for
living here are still unclear.  The elves have made no effort to make him
leave, welcoming him as one of their own, and providing him with almost
anything he requests, his skills are sorely needed here.  Beautifully made
weapons and armor line the wall.  Swords of all shapes and sizes, as well as
beautifully engraved warhammers and battle-axes, line the walls.  ALL of
Teglaron's weapons are perfectly balanced, to test one before buying would be
an insult and it is always unwise to insult a dwarf.  Shields and chainmail
also line the walls, but only a few of each seem to actually be for sale.  A

&+BTeglaron's Forge&N~
   This is the room where Teglaron does all of his work.  The hot fire
of the forge occupies the center of the room.  A cleverly made bellows
allows a single person to work by stepping on a simple pedal.  Along the
southern wall there are three barrels, containing oil, saltwater, and
water, respectively.  Ingots of several different metals, and a few raw
ores have been piled near the northern wall.  Closer to the forge there
is a large anvil and a rack containing a number of hammers of different
weights, as well as some other tools.  Slots in the roof channel some of
the hot air out, but even so, the room is so hot it is hard to believe
anyone could work in it all day long.  An open doorway leads back into
the armory to the east.

&+BTeglaron's Living Quarters&N~
   Rare stones have been carefully fitted together to make the walls and floor
of this pretty room.  Light reflects off delicate quartz lampshades to gently
illuminate the room.  A mithril and silver battle-axe hangs from stone pegs in
the northern wall.  Stone encircles the handle of the axe preventing anyone
from taking it, though the right code word or spell might free it.  Beside the
axe is a gold-embossed shield that has also been melded with the wall.  The
skull of a large dragon rests on top of a marble dresser along the eastern wall
and a plain stone bed has been pushed against the southern wall.  A small stone
stairway leads upward into the armory.

&+gA Crossing of Paths&N~
   The moss-lined path splits here, heading north through the elven village as
well as to the east and west along the wall that separates it from the jungle.
The wall itself is quite impressive, made entirely of jodani wood that has been
flawlessly melded together.  Magical treatments have added to the natural
strengths of the wood to make it even more impervious to both physical and
magical attacks.

Voices can be heard from above and to the north, it is clear that the wild-

through the high branches as if they were solid ground.

There is no kitchen of any sort to be seen, the only furniture here is a set of
twin beds flanked by racks for holding armor and weapons and a single chair.
The only item that is close to being decorative is the lantern that hangs from
the ceiling, the glass facets have been engraved on each side with the symbol
of a jodani leaf.  An open doorway leads back out to a moss-lined path to the

   A massive gray boulder to the north blocks the path from going any further
and the tremendous roots of a jodani tree block passage to the east.  To the
west there is a huge ebonwood tree that has a door made of some creamy brown
wood in its face.  The whole area is somewhat quiet and peaceful, though a bit
hot and humid.  The elves that reside in this village are clearly quite
cautious of what sort of people they allow in their village, that they allow
any other than elves is an amazement in and of itself.

   Three of the most senior guardsmen of the village reside here, close to
the wall in case they are needed, yet far enough away to be peaceful and quiet.
Pegs beside the door can be used to hang weapons, and carefully made racks
along the northern wall have clearly been designed to hold armor for cleaning
and repairs.  Three beds have been suspended from the western wall, hanging
down from the wall like steps, each above another, with no legs of any sort to
support them.  The elves that do live here must eat elsewhere for there is no
kitchen here, nor even a place to store food.

almost fifty feet off the ground.  Small yellow hand prints mark the
sides of the smooth boulders, alongside each hand print a name is written
in elven.  Branches of the ebonwood trees above block almost all light,
and surely any rain, from hitting the ground here.  The narrow pathway

   Entry to the small elven home to the west requires first walking

near some hanging orchids suspended from the branches above providing
yet another distraction.  A frail looking ladder leads downward and the

   The most striking thing about this tiny room is its organization.
Everything seems to be in its own special place and there isn't a trace
of dust anywhere in the room.  No windows or openings have been made to
allow any air in or out, yet the room is pleasantly cool.  A narrow bed
is wedged between a desk and bookcase along the western wall.  The
ceiling glows with a magical light that seems to find every corner of
the room.  The northern wall is lined with shelves of different colored
vials.  None of the vials are labeled but they are organized by color
going by the repeated order red, green, yellow, orange, and blue.  A
small canister near the desk contains what appear to be broken or spent
wands as well as some additional garbage.  The only exit to the room is
a door to the south.

   Rain is an everyday occurrence here in the jungle, but the tree branches high
above tend to catch most of the water, allowing only a fine mist to pass
through to the ground, shattered much like the thin beams of sunlight that
barely make it to the ground when the rain ceases.  The path here is coated
with a thick moss making it easy to travel on despite its rapid rising and
falling as it twists around large tree roots and boulders.

northwest until it reaches branches that must be almost forty feet above the
ground.  The path to the west meets the base of a tremendous jodani tree, and
the paths to the north and east pass by large ebonwoods as well.  The southern
trail appears to curve a great deal past large trees and several clusters of
small boulders to pass out of sight.

   The short moss pathway ends here.  A mixture of low elven voices can
be heard from above, it sounds almost as if there is a small elven party
going on somewhere within the tree.  The air is a bit more humid here
because roots as large as some elven homes block the wind from the
north and south and the tree itself blocks any breeze from the west.
Small grooves in the tree allow it to be climbed up to a doorway that
leads to its interior.

The roots of this ancient tree seem to sprawl away from it in an almost

out, they could be made into nice homes.

&+YSummerstorm's&N &+yBar and Meeting Hall&N~
   A single huge room has been hollowed out of the tree here.  Softly glowing
wooden rods in each corner shed light on the entire room.  This room is large
enough to hold the entire adult elven population of Moonhollow without any
problems and serves as a bar, meeting hall, and celebration room by the few
elves that live here.  A long ebonwood bar rests along the western wall and a
number of small tables occupy the center of the room.  A large round meeting
table is in the northeast corner of the room.  The contrast of the dark
ebonwood tables and bar with the red hued jodani walls and creamy brown tazten
wood chairs somehow creates a peaceful atmosphere.  Small elven tapestries
decorate the eastern wall.  A long list of names has been carved into the
northern wall next to the meeting table.  A ladder behind the bar leads up to
Summerstorm's private quarters and an exit in the eastern wall leads back out
to Moonhollow.

   Summerstorm, the leader of the elves, lives here alone.  The huge
room contains a small bed near a window in the eastern wall as well as a
beautifully crafted desk and bookshelves along the northern wall.  The
southern portion of the room is dedicated to a small shrine to goddess
Elhonna.  An elven bridal gown has been set beside the shrine like some
sort of offering or remembrance.  Wooden rods beside the bed and on the
desk provide dim lighting for the entire room.  Only the quality of the
few trappings in his room reflect Summerstorm's importance.  Above the
desk a short inscription has been carved into the wood in large letters.
The only exit is down into the meeting hall.

center of the tree.  The branch here is somewhat precarious, worn smooth by the
many agile elves that have passed across it over the years.  A ladder along the
side of the tree heads back down toward the ground forty feet below and an
opening in the side of the tree leads into an elven home.

Several small beds line the northern wall and a larger bed can be seen behind a
curtain to the east.  A small kitchen and stove are to the south, constructed
beneath a small hole in the side of the tree that must act as a vent for the
heat and aromas created while cooking there.  An opening in the western wall

&+yOn Some Branches High Above the Ground&N~
   Over the centuries the branches of several ebonwood trees have grown
together to form an intertwining network.  These sturdy limbs are used
as simple pathways between the rooms that have been carved out of the
trees themselves.  These branches are so old that branches above have
cut off all of their light.  To the west, the trunks and branches of two
large ebonwoods have grown together and from this joining a large open
room has been made for the elven children to play in.  The ladder
leading downward from here appears broken just below.

   A number of young elves of varying ages are playing here.  The ground below
slopes sharply upward and some of the trees growing on that slope have had some
difficulty keeping their places.  One large ebonwood grew out at an angle until
it met another and followed its trunk upward.  The combination of the trunks of
these two large trees as well as their lower branches has allowed the creation
of a huge room that is completely open to the east.  Large lighting poles have
been placed along the sides of the room so that it always stays lit.  A variety
of games lie around, from dolls to toy bows and colored marbles.  The room
continues to the north and exits onto some branches to the east.

it and still be able to erase it for further use.  On one wall someone
has written, "Sometimes the true value and importance of something can
only be felt when it is lost."  A tapestry along the northern wall
depicts a village near a winding stream.  The room continues to the

group of elves.  Some catastrophe has left these poor children without
not only their parents, but also any other relatives that would also
care for them.  There are no dressers or other furniture, the beds seem
to fill the entire room, the children need to put their clothes and
other personal belongings underneath the beds.  Everything in the room
seems just a bit disorganized, as if the children TRY to keep it clean

   It is odd to note that the only sign telling anyone that this narrow path
indeed has a name has been placed virtually in the center of the village.  The
carefully carved jodani wood sign proclaims the path to be Mistmore Lane',
probably due to the fine mist that slowly floats down from the branches high
above when it rains.  Elven voices can be heard from the trees above, it seems
that most the elves have made their homes in the tree branches high above the
ground.  Just to the north a narrow stairway has been carved into the gentle
slope of a young jodani tree's root.  Mistmore Lane continues to the south and
east, winding past boulders and tree roots as it travels through the village.

their corners so that the goods can be viewed from all sides.  An open doorway

has been constructed.

&+GBeside an Ancient Elven Shrine&N~
   An intricate marble statue stands here, surrounded by a wide variety of
orchids and flowering bushes.  The statue itself is well worn, showing that it
has been standing here for many years, yet the details are still quite clear.
Powerful, but sweet, aromas waft up from the flowers, an offering to the elven
goddess of nature that incense would never be able to match.  The clearing
continues to the north where several benches have been set amidst a wide
collection of aromatic flowers.

&+LThe Entryway to &+CWindstrider's&N &+LRestaurant&N~
   Worn smooth by the passage of many feet a large flat branch forms the
narrow entryway into Windstrider's restaurant.  A wide variety of spices
and aromas are coming from Windstrider's to the north and some birds can
be heard singing in the branches high above.  The sky is filled with
branches and leaves, it is hard to even imagine sunlight reaching this
spot.  A ladder leads back down and Windstrider's is to the north.

&+CWindstrider's Restaurant&N~
   Creamy brown tazten wood furniture fills the dark ebonwood room.
Small rods on every table provide gently lighting throughout the
restaurant.  The ebonwood walls have been so highly polished that they
reflect light with a soft black glow.  Jodani wood inlays have been
added to the walls in a pattern that creates the illusion of additional
space and adds to the light airy feel of the room.  Loud banging can be
heard from the kitchen to the east as well as a faint pop and hiss of
something roasting.  The powerful aromas indicate that only certain
spicy elven delicacies are served here.  Windstrider is known for her
unique recipe for roast anaconda and flavorful spicy duck.  Another rare
dish is her turtle soup, which she only serves occasionally.  The
entryway to the restaurant is to the south and the kitchen is through a
curtain of wooden beads to the east.

&+CWindstrider's Kitchen&N~
   Strong odors of rare spices and peppers seem to blast from every
direction.  Dark ebonwood walls reflect the light and heat of a large
flat stone that Windstrider uses for cooking.  The stone is located
along the northern wall near a hole that allows air in and out of the
tree.  Pots and pans ring the walls as well as small pieces of parchment
that contain what appear to be recipes.  The eastern wall contains both
a set of shelves containing a wide variety of spices and peppers and a
ladder that leads upwards into Windstrider's family quarters.

din of the cooking going on below.  Light from the kitchen below
provides dim illumination as it reflects off the highly polished wood.

   Soft linen curtains are gently shaken by the breeze that comes

Treetops of other trees can be seen through the windows in every
direction, this room must be very high above the ground, and even above
some of the trees in the area.  A small bed made of ironwood rests
against the northern window and a round table with two chairs occupies
the center of the room.  A dresser stands in the northeastern corner and
a sheathed longsword and longbow hang from hooks in the western wall.
Strange ancient looking tomes rest on a bookshelf in the southwestern

&+gBeneath Some Large &+LEbonwood&+g Trees&N~
   The trees are so thick here that the moss-lined path is forced from south to
west where it runs to an even thicker group of trees.  Moisture hangs in the
air here, the trees block any breeze from moving the dank air away.  Birds high
above are singing their songs, soundly oddly in tune with the sounds of a flute
that seems to float through the air.  Grooves have been cut into the largest of
the ebonwood trees to the east to create a ladder to climb up to the homes that
must have been made in the branches above.

   Where there was once a large branch there is now only the stump of one
remaining.  The stump provides a useful resting point as one climbs to the
higher branches, as well as the landing before a door leading inside the tree
itself. Brightly plumed birds dart through the branches above providing flashes
of color as they pass through the canopy.  Grooves in the trunk of the tree
climb both up and down and there is a door set into the face of the tree to the
east.

   The spartan furnishings in this plain one room hut make it seem
almost prison-like.  A single fragile looking chair rests against the
western wall beside a small table.  Plain white sheets have been tightly
stretched across a very hard looking mattress on the bed against the
northern wall.  A few pots and pans in the southeast corner and the lack
of dust are the only suggestion that someone actually lives here.  Even
though there are no windows the room is quite cool and would appear to
be a safe place to rest.  A wooden door exits to the west.

   A wide branch has been used as a bridge to connect to trees just north and
south of this one.  Branches above droop down covering this area in darkness
and trapping in the humid air.  The smooth ebonwood bark looks almost polished
by the wear of many feet.  Boulders, both large and small, litter the ground
below and to the south.  Some moss or fungus tints the stones with a gray-green
color.  Grooves cut into the tree lead downward toward the ground and doorways
can be seen in the trees to the north and south.

   Glowing rods spaced about the room keep it very brightly lit.
Brightly colored tapestries and musical instruments are hung everywhere.
Flutes are suspended from pegs everywhere along the wall, hung as if
they were weapons.  An ancient mandolin, certainly too old to be played
hangs from a peg near the doorway.  A huge silver harp sits on a
pedestal near the center of the room.  It is obvious whoever lives here
values their instruments and music above all else.  There are no kitchen
implements and only one jug of water can be seen in the entire room.
The only pieces of furniture are a large bed near the northern wall and
a small chair in the center of the room, both of which have been painted
bright red and orange.  The bright light and mixture of colors could
make anyone's head spin, fortunately it can be easily escaped through a
doorway to the west.

remains of a dead and decaying tree can be seen.  Some of the
overhanging branches have been trimmed away a bit to allow in light and
wind.  Ever present insects swarm around trying to avoid becoming dinner
for the many birds flying around.  A flute is being played somewhere
nearby but the way the sound seems to echo through the branches makes it
impossible to say where it is coming from.

absorb all sound making this a quiet and peaceful spot, though quite hot
and stagnant due to the lack of any breeze.

   The ebonwood ladder leads higher toward a network of branches that
lead to several elven homes.  Agile elves can be seen moving swiftly
from branch to branch without any thought to how high above the ground
they are.  An elven lullaby is being sung to a crying baby above and to
the north and the sounds of children playing can be heard to the south.
The idea of climbing up or down this ladder while carrying a baby or
small child is appalling but, for the elves, this must be the norm.

   Sturdy ebonwood branches have grown together here to form a
relatively safe resting spot.  It is difficult to relax though when one
realizes that a fall from here would mean instant death.  Elves must be
used to traveling amongst the branches for they seem completely
unfazed.  Thousands of small insects are flying and crawling along the
branches here trying to avoid the many colorful birds that are flying
back and forth eating them.  The entrances to two elven homes can be
seen in the trees to the south and north.

and several large cloth chairs are against the western wall.  A small
cooking area along the western wall looks heavily used and, frankly,
like it is need of some cleaning.  Small windows line the eastern and

from the western wall.  Aside from the weapons, and some pegs for
additional weapons that must be in use now, the walls are unadorned.  A
large window in the northern wall faces one of the cliffs that flank the

cooking stone is in the northeastern corner of the room along with a
collection of pots and pans hung high on the wall.  Toy bows have been
hung neatly on the wall near the beds and all of the beds have been
made.  Long narrow windows line the walls.  Oddly enough, the windows
are large enough to let in air but too small for an elven toddler to
climb through.  The only exit is to the north back to a ladder leading
down to the ground.

texts and colorful vials are strewn about on the bookcase in no apparent
order.  Several parchments are resting on the desk as well as an ink jar
and quill.  The dark ebonwood floor near the desk is marred by an even
darker spot of ink.  The tiny size of the home, and its state of

The ebonwood trees that surround this lone jodani are so close that all the

from.

any sounds entering from outside.  A thick coat of dust covers the sturdy
ebonwood furniture and even the old unlit lantern that hangs from the ceiling.
The desk and table along the northern wall are both very sturdy and well-made,
though quite plain.  A bed along the southern wall has intricate carvings of

toward a large ebonwood tree.

&+yA Ledge at the End of a Network of Branches&N~
   The thick, twisted lattice of branches comes to an abrupt end here where it
has been sheared off by lightning or some other disastrous event.  Despite the
destruction, the network of branches is still quite strong here, strong enough
to support several small benches so that relaxing elves can look out at the
rest of the jungle.  An added benefit is the nice breeze that swirls through
the area moving the humid air enough to provide some relief from the heat.

&+LA Rocky Mountain Pass&N~
   A great deal of lose rubble lines this narrow path, showing that it is
rarely used, even by the creatures that actually live in these mountains.
Every once in a while a golden eagle can be seen circling the area, and
sometimes mountain goats can be seen nimbly hopping from rock to rock.  The
path continues upward through a jagged pass into the mountains and heads back
down toward a pine forest to the south.

&+LA Jagged Mountain Pass&N~
   Jagged rocks line both sides of the pass as it continues its steep ascent
into the mountains.  Sometime in the recent past an earthquake must have
sheared much of the mountain walls here off, leaving jagged stone behind and
dropping rubble onto the path below here.  The air is getting thinner as one
climbs, even so, warm air rolls down the pass from above.  It is odd to note
that the air above and to the south seems warmer than the air below and to the
north.

   Lose gravel has fallen down from the mountains above making footing here a
bit treacherous.  Even the mountain goats prefer to hope about on the higher
rocks to avoid the dangerous footing.  The mountain pass continues to climb as
it heads east as well as heading down toward the north.

   Someone has camped here recently, very recently.  The embers left on a flat
rock to the south are still glowing with a red heat.  There is enough dust and
lose gravel around that one would expect to seem some tracks here, yet there
are none to be found.  The narrow path continues to wind its way up and down
through the mountains.

   The jagged mountain tops still seem to tower over even this high spot. A few
twisted bushes and trees grow in cracks in the rocky walls but their growth has
been stunted by the high winds and harsh conditions this high in the mountains.
Gurgling water can be heard from somewhere further above.  The mountain pass
continues its slow ascent through the mountains to the south and descends to the
north.

&+LAbove a Mountain &+bStream&N~
   The mountain pass ends as it reaches a point above a small mountain stream.
The stream is fed by water tumbling down from the mountains on all sides, small
rivulets of water feeding into it along its entire length.  A quick step to the
south will put one into the cool mountain waters and a narrow mountain pass
heads downward to the north.

   Water feeds into the stream from all sides, though the majority of it comes
tumbling in off the jagged stones to the east.  A current tugs everything here
to the south, where the stream appears to widen and get stronger.  There are no
fish here, the water tumbling down the mountains must not pause in any pools
large enough for fish to spawn before getting washed down the mountains.

&+bThe Stream Gains Momentum&N~
   More and more water flows into the stream from the steep mountains all
around here, making it grow larger and stronger as it heads south.  The current
is almost unmanageable, even the strongest swimmers would have difficulty
fighting it.  The streams flows south, gaining strength and speed as it
travels, and the current can be fought to head back north into the mountains.

&+bA Fork in the River&N~
   Having collected enough water to be safely called a river, the stream splits
here at the base of a massive boulder.  A small stream flows east toward some
sort of small pool while the main body of the river throws itself south where
it plunges over a cliff.

with a distinct current to the east.  Water pours in from overhead to the
north, flowing off the mountains into the stream bed as it drives toward a
small mountain pool to the east.  The stream is fed by a river to the west and
continues through a wide pool to the east.

   Fed by a stream to the west and by water flowing in from the mountains to
the north, this pool is relatively calm and quiet.  Crystal clear water extends
to the south and east and a stream leads off to the west.  Though the bottom of
the pool is easy to see through the clear water, there are few fish or other
creatures living here, it is likely that periodic rains effectively flush
everything in the pool down the mountain.

&+bThe Pool Overflows into a Waterfall&N~
   The lack of fish in the pool is far easier to explain now.  A gap in the
southern wall allows the water to flow smoothly out of the pool and over a
cliff to fall hundreds of feet down to the jungle below.  The jungle is so far
below that the dark green canopy appears to be cloaked in a foggy mist.  The
clear water of the pool extends to the north and west and a waterfall plummets
downward in a plume of mist.

   This portion of the pool is particularly calm, along the northern face of
the pool water tumbles down from the mountains, to the east water flows out of
the pool over the edge of a cliff.  A few eddies form against the stone walls
here but the water is otherwise clear and calm.  Deep beneath the water there
seems to be something glittering amongst the rubble.  The clear water continues
to the north and east.

&+bFalling With the Waterfall&N~
   The water pours downward toward collections of rocks that stick out of the
cliff as if they were designed to smash the water, and anything in it, into a
fine mist.  A deafening roar from below seems to travel up the water, deafening
anyone within it.  The water falls over the edge of the cliff above with such
force that only those with the most powerful magical aids can overcome its
strength, even with such abilities success is not guaranteed.

&+LA Steep Path&N~
   The narrow path is nothing more than a few hand and foot-holds spaced
on the sheer face of the cliff.  Vines reach up from the jungle below and
some even hang down from the canopy that is still just above.  The sounds
and smell of the humid jungle penetrate the air, and moisture clings to
the slippery stone face of the cliff making the climb treacherous.

&+LEven With the &+GCanopy&N~
   The slippery hand-holds meet the canopy here, exposed to the sunlight
and colors that are normally held in the darkness and gloom of the jungle.
Moisture clings to the sheer face of the cliff making climbing dangerous.
Birds and other creatures can be seen darting through the canopy, and the
echoing cries of both the hunted and the hunters can be heard slicing
through the moist air below.

   Cloying, warm, humid air rises up from below to cling to the sheer
stone of the cliff face.  The way down to the jungle is treacherous, but
the view is beautiful to behold.  The jungle canopy below stretches to the
north and west, dotted with flowers of all colors and varieties.  The
hand-holds continue both up and down, but the climb is one for fools.

&+gAbove a Verdant Jungle&N~
   The deep Rift Valley Jungle lies far below, its deep green canopy
spotted with tiny spots of brilliant color.  There are hand-holds in the
face of the cliff that head downward out of sight and a narrow trail leads
off to the south.

&+LA Narrow Mountain Pass&N~
   Tight, jagged rocks line the narrow pass through the mountains.  The
dust and debris on the path make it clear that this path is not traveled
very often.  A moist breeze curls in from the north and the path continues
to the southeast.

&+LA Narrow Mountain Pass&N~
   This narrow pass winds its way through the Sharp Tooth Mountains to
some mysterious destination.  Sharp rocks line both sides of the path as
the steep mountains stretch their way toward the clouds.  As it curves to
the northwest the path continues to climb and it heads sharply downward to
the south.

&+LA Steep Mountain Path&N~
   Signs that this path are in use quickly disappear here as it continues
its steep climb into the mountains to the north.  Eagles can be circling
high above, floating lazily on currents of air while searching for prey in
the mountains below.  The peaks of the mountains thrust themselves upward
to reach the clouds.  The path continues its steep climb to the north and
heads downward to the south.

&+LA Tight Turn&N~
   The path slips between two large stones as it creeps in from the east,
and makes a sudden, steep climb into the mountains to the north.  The air
here is crisp and dry, even a bit dusty.  There is a quiet solitude to the
area, as if all the animals have been frightened away by something.

   The pass twists and turns as it winds its way through the lowest gaps
in the Sharp Tooth Mountains.  Mountains stretch upwards on all sides,
blocking out the sun as well as any view of what might be ahead or behind.
Many creatures have been known to use such passes as traps for the unwary,
and there are clear signs of avalanches that have occurred in the
not-so-distant past.

   A narrow pass heads into the Sharp Tooth Mountains here.  Exactly where
it leads and how far up into the mountains it climbs is a mystery.  The
peaks of the mountains themselves stretch high into the air, almost
reaching the wispy clouds that float by them.  A forest can be seen to the
south and the mountains lie to the north.

about the cavern, they too are large enough for giants.  The massive
