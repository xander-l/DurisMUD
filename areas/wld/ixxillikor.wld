&+mAn Opening in a Narrow Crevice&n~
&+L   A small cave has been revealed by past geologic forces. An eartquake, or
&+La simple shifting of seismic plates have opened this cavern which would
&+Lappear to have been sealed for centuries. The canyon walls have crumbled
&+Linto dust at the earthquakes force laying bare a small hollow in the
&+Lcavern walls.  Cracks run like &+Wj&+wa&+Wg&+wg&+We&+wd &+Llightning bolts all around the
&+Lwalls of the confined cave, one peculiar set of bolts vaguely resembles the
&+Lshape of a small door. The dust from the crushed rock still lies on the
&+Lground. Footprints are embedded in the dust giving indication that some type
&+Lof humanoid dwells within the darkness. It is difficult to determine the type
&+Lof animal as there are numerous tracks of varying sizes mingled together.&n

&+mWithin a Narrow Crevice&n~
&+L   One must twist their bodies sideways in hopes of fitting theough
&+Lthis narrow crevice of rock. The jagged edges grasping at any loose clothing.
&+LAs one stops and peers about they suddenly have a thought that millions of
&+Ltons of earth hang oppressively overhead. A sudden earthquake or shifting of
&+Lrock would pulverize any who still remained within this crevice. Small yellow
&+Lclumps of fungus grow in the crevices of rock. The plants feed by the strange
&+Lunderdark radiation that bathes the area in a purplish glow. The low chanting
&+Lsound of voices echo through the area bouncing off the rock walls. The
&+Lconstant change preventing one from determining the direction of origin.&n

&+mA Wide Crevice Overlooking a Cliff&n~
&+L   The crevice opens up into a wide expanse of underdark caverns. A forest of
&+Lgiant mushrooms, their tops extending from the depths below, continue until
&+Lreaching a wall of solid rock at the far end of the cavern. Strong thermal
&+Lwinds, the result of underground fissures, swirl around ones body. Ever so
&+Loften a strong gust feels as though one will be pushed over the edge of the
&+Lcliff. Small stalagmites serve as a means in which one can steady theirselves
&+Lagainst the underdark current. Gazing out over the cavern, the swirling purple
&+Lhaze of underdark radiation, does little to illuminate what lies in the depths
&+Lof this cavern.&n

&+L   Exiting the mushroom forest one now faces a sheer cliff of stone. The cliff
&+Lappears to rise straight up to the caverns ceiling making it an almost
&+Lunclimbable formation. As one begins to look around for an easier way
&+Lto scale the cliff, they notice small footholds have been chiseled into the
&+Lrock. The footholds adequately spaced for one to climb. Peering up the height
&+Lof the cliff, small ledges protrude from the sides providing one a place in

&+MThe Edge of a Mushroom Forest&n~
&+L   As one enters this section of the cavern their vision is blocked by the
&+Llarge, treelike mushrooms that sprout from the nutrient rich soil of this
&+Lunderground cavern. Unlike other sections of the underdark with rocky floors,
&+Lthe soil that lies in heaps in this cavern is the result of fungi that have
&+Ldecayed centuries ago. Their large stalks decaying into soft, moist, nutrient
&+Lfilled soil. Numerous species of fungi spread through the cavern like the
&+Lgreat phoenix forest on the surface world. Small &+yan&+Lima&+yls &+Lcan be seen
&+Lmeandering through the forest, nibbling on bits of mushrooms and other fungi.
&+LThe air,laden with moisture, settles on the mushroom stalks and quickly
&+Lcondenses into water. Some of the water forming small puddles in which black
&+Linsects skim across. The mushroom forest continues in all directions.&n

&+Lof the ledge, assessing any danger, then quickly returning to its enclave
&+Lof stone. Sounds of hammers striking s&+yto&+Lne escape from behind the gates. The
&+Lsounds indicating that beyond these walls an underdark city slowly expands.
&+LHanging from chains that are burrows into the cavern wall are the corpses of
&+La drow raiding party. Examining their faces, one notices four narrow holes
&+Lburrowed into the flesh. Two beside the eyes and two in the neck. The raiding
&+Lparty, having been subdued, and then drained by their illithid captors. The
&+Llifeless bodies now serve as a warning to any outsiders that venture within
&+Lthe domain of the illithid city of &+MIxxillikor&+L.&n

&+ywithin the cavern. Having been captured in recent raids, they are now slaves,
&+yworking at the behest of thier illithid masters. The illithid mind control a

&+ycomplete, numerous duergar and dwarven craftsmen still hang dangerously from
&+ythin ropes. Their task, and single goal, to please their masters by carving
&+ybeautiful patterns into the spire. A couple of ropes hang free from ledges.
&+yThe empty knots indicating that either the rope snapped, or the enslaved
&+ybeings broke free from the illithid mind control and cut the ropes. Either
&+yway, death awaited as the craftsman fell to the cavern floor. Even though
&+ytheir bodies were quickly drained and discarded, the bronze hued stain of

&+y   Stretching for as far as the eye can see stands the illithid rockspire. A
&+ysingle column of stone that twists its way to the ceiling of this high cavern.
&+yThe awe inspiring rockspire, a single feat of illithid might. Even though
&+ycomplete, numerous duergar and dwarven craftsmen still hang dangerously from
&+ythin ropes. Their task, and single goal, to please their masters by carving
&+ybeautiful patterns into the spire. A couple of ropes hang free from ledges.
&+yThe empty knots indicating that either the rope snapped, or the enslaved
&+ybeings broke free from the illithid mind control and cut the ropes. Either
&+yway, death awaited as the craftsman fell to the cavern floor. Even though

&+y   Both Neogi and Illithid slave traders are busy browsing the wares for sale
&+yat the Ixxillikor marketplace.  The activity here along these rows of shops
&+yisn't as busy as those shops nearest the auction block. The shops along this
&+ysection of the markets primarily catering to the wealthier citizens of
&+yixxillikor. These merchants specializing in trinkets and bracelets taken in
&+yraids on the surface dwellers. As one walks past the shops they notice dwarf
&+yand duergar craftsman. These dominated slaves intent on forging new
&+ytrinkets for their illithid masters.&n

&+CThe Crowded Markets of Ixxillikor&n~
&+y   Set within small alcoves carved into the walls of this vast cavern are
&+ynumerous shops set up by illithid merchants. Crowds of illithid, their slaves
&+yin tow, browse the markets looking for magical trinkets. Some holding up long
&+yflowing garments sewn by the merchants slaves. A single stall set in the back
&+yof a large alcove seems to be the single gathering point for a majority of the
&+ycrowd. As one moves closer to the wares being sold they notice that they are
&+ynothing more than glass containers filled with a pink fleshy liquid. The
&+yillithids that flock to the stall purchase the containers, and with much
&+yanticipation, drain the liquid with their tentacles.&n

&+CThe Crowded Markets of Ixxillikor&n~
&+y   Illithid and Neogi commoners, along with wealthy slave traders, stand
&+ytogether in the city's marketplace. Exotic wares taken as bounty during
&+ysuccessful raids sell alongside more common wares such as food and clothing.
&+yVisible in the marketplace are slaves of almost every race imaginable. The
&+yslaves walk slightly behind their masters serving as porters to carry any
&+ypurchased goods. A few of the slaves are tethered to thick leather leashes.
&+yThe excess leather serving as a whip should the Illithid's mental hold on
&+ytheir slave start to diminish.&n

&+y   A heavily worn trail leads toward the bustling markets of Ixillian.
&+yNumerous illithid and neogi of all manner and station visit the markets in
&+ysearch of goods to buy, or simply to watch many of the impromptu slave fights
&+ythat take place in the arena. Numerous side wages by the illithid and neogi
&+yserving as a means of additional income from those that have captured and
&+ynurtured the strongest slaves. Many of the slaves walking through the markets
&+yserve as porters for their masters carrying their wares as they are purchased.&n

&+ymarkets of the city.  Numerous slaves of many races walk with their illithid
&+ymasters in the cities markets. Many of the slaves walking through here are
&+ybeing led to the auction block and are being sold by their masters. From this
&+yvantage point an excellent view of the commanding Rockspire can be seen. The
&+yimmense stone structure houses the Elder Brain of Ixillian and is the seat of
&+ythe cities leadership.  The nearby markets are the thriving force behind the

&+yillithid and their slaves to crowd at the tunnels entrance. The narrow
&+ytunnel that burrows its way through the cavernous rock is only wide enough to
&+yallow a few illithid and their slaves to stand abreast. A duergar miner can
&+ybe seen chiseling away at the tunnels entrance. The slave does not appear to
&+ybe attempting to widen the entrance, but rather to carve intricate designs
&+yinto its opening. With each srike of the chisel, a rain of dist and debris
&+yfalls on the crowd below. A few illithid stop and contemplate the slaves death
&+ybut think better of it as he is under the control of the elder brain.&n

&+ysearching for unique trinkets in which to display in their homes. Many
&+yjewels and articles of cloth are displayed atop stone slabs. The items taken

&+yselling slaves, walk among the merchants stalls purchasing finely woven robes
&+yand gold trinkets. Their slaves stand ready to carry the purchased wares back
&+yto their masters dwelling. A few slaves, too weak to carry their masters

&+yhaggling and selling innumerable wares.  Many of the Enslavers are on their
&+yway to the arena after making a quick stop at the great auction block in the
&+ycenter of the great markets. At the auction block, virtually any type of being
&+ythe illithid and neogi have enslaved can be bought for a small price.  A few
&+yof the merchants sell embroidered robes and fancily woven clothing, others
&+ysell trinkets or works of art for the illithids to display in their homes.&n

&+y   A gathering crowd of illithid and neogi enslavers concentrate around the
&+ylarge stone platform that sits in the middle of the Ixxillikor markets. Slaves
&+yof almost every race imaginable are led up short stone steps to the center of
&+ythe platform which protrudes out directly above the gathering crowds. As the
&+yslaves step onto the platform, the crowds surge forward trying to get a
&+ybetter look at the creatures muscle density. Those slaves that are purchased
&+yare immediately led off by their masters. Whether to a fight in the arena, or
&+yto the dining table it is unclear. Those slaves that are not immediately
&+ypurchased are led back to the slave pens to the north. To the west, the
&+yvibrations of stomping feet can be heard echoing off the rock.&n

&+yAs slaves are purchased they are either taken back to their masters hovel to

&+yslave arena. At the arena, the slaves will fight, to the death, at their

&+y   A broad cavern twists and turns off of a heavily traveled trail.  The
&+ycavern plateau is a jumble of gorges and bends that seem as though every twist
&+yof rock has a narrow doorway burrowed into it. The walls of the cavern are
&+yhoneycombed with numerous dwellings. Most appear to be home to the cities
&+yillithids. Ever so often an illithid will exit its dwelling and levitate down
&+yto the cavern floor before heading off to either the markets or to the slave
&+yarena. A few slaves, walking close to their illithid masters, carry wares and
&+ygoods purchased at the markets of ixxillikor. Visible in the cavern is the
&+ygreat rockspire. Home to the elder brain, the central seat of influence over
&+ythe ilithid city of ixxillikor.&n

&+ymolded and shaped by the enslaved beings controlled by their illithid masters.
&+yThe community project of reshaping the hard rock within the cavern so that it
&+ynow serves as a home for the elder brain. This ominous being controlling all

&+ymaterial plane. Massive iron gates seem to grow out of the very rock as one
&+yapproaches the rockspire, closing off the entrance to all uninvited guests. A

&+CCrossing a Wide Bridge of Stone&n~

&+ybridge spans nearly a hundred feet across a raging river. The water, quickly
&+ymoving, crashes against the &+Lro&+yc&+Lks &+ybelow spraying a fine mist as one attempts
&+yto cross the bridge. The water that has collected at its base feeds a green
&+yalgae that in a couple of centuries will engulf the entire bridge. The bridge
&+yseparates the herdlands from the main cavern of Ixxillikor. The bridge is
&+yfairly narrow, barely eight feet across preventing any of the herd from
&+yescaping their grazing fields. The gusting thermal winds blow fiercly, couple
&+yby the wet stone, crossing this bridge is rather treacherous for the many
&+yillithid and slaves that head toward the herds.&n

&+ythe center of the river, where the water travels the fastest, large rocks
&+yform a small barrier. As the water strikes the barrier, a cool mist is carried

&+yhigh walls of the canyon, their smooth surface preventing them from being

&+yceiling standing out like a beacon to all within the city. The canyon wall
&+ysouth of here has crumbled away  revealing a small cave. A few scantily clad
&+yillithid quickly survey the area before entering the cave. As one continues

&+gThe Rothe Grazing Fields&n~
&+g   A narrow rock wall encircles the edge of the island which is cut of from
&+gthe main cavern by a raging river. The echo of water striking the cavern walls
&+gsends dull vibrations through the area. The sound carried by the thermal winds
&+gfrom deep within the core of Duris. An immense wall of rock rises across
&+gthe chasm blocking any view of the illithid city of ixxillikor.  The thermal
&+gwinds that do not pick up moisture from the river to the east provide a small
&+gmeasure of warmth through the area. The increased temperature from the
&+gsurrounding cavern makes this an ideal grazing ground for the cities herd of
&+grothe. The large beasts lie on the grass or feed off the fungus. A few slaves
&+gcan be seen wandering about the area ensuring that none of the herd wander to
&+gclose to the cliffs at the edge of the island.&n

&+Lincreases the slime finally snaps from the ceiling striking the ground with a

&+Lspidering out onto the rocky tunnel. Small plants of algae, not covered by the
&+Lslime, grow in the narrow crevices. Dried stems of fungus, the moisture sucked
&+Lout from their roots lie crimbling in the corners of the passage. The dried

&+mA Narrow Passageway Covered in Slime~
&+L   Neogi, accompanied by a few finely dressed illithid, come and go in this
&+Lnarrow tunnel that winds its way through the eastern side of the cavern.
&+LPolished slabs of dark granite, delicately set in place and fastened with a
&+Lreddish hued mortar, form the floor of the passageway.  The tunnel is just
&+Lbarely large enough to accommodate the illithid. The neogi being much smaller
&+Lthan their allies, have no problem maneuvering through the passage. Intricate
&+Lrunes in a glyph that only the enslavers can decipher run the length of the
&+Lfloor. The glyphs a magical ward to protect the neogi and their allies.&n

&+mOutside a Sinister Tower of Black Stone&n~
&+L   Contrasting sharply from the other formations of stone within the cavern,
&+Lthis tower rises up toward the caverns ceiling. The spiraling formation of
&+Lstone appearing as though it is a unicorns horn. The round ridges starting at
&+Lthe base and working their way to its tip. The dark stone appears as though
&+Lwhisps of smoke engulf it. As one gazes its length, they notice small windows
&+Lcut within the stone. Shadows move back and forth from the windows indicating
&+Lthat some beings dwell within the sanctity of the tower. The entranceway is a
&+Lsingle stone, seamless in construction. The tower itself contrasts sharply
&+Lfrom the more numerous dwellings of illithid enclaves giving indication that
&+Lthis may be one of the illithid allies that have claimed a small section of
&+Lthis vast cavern.&n

&+mEntrance to a Tower of Black Stone&n~
&+L   This tower seems to be fashioned from a single dark stone. As one gazes
&+Lat the walls they notice that there are no seams or mortar.  A slight
&+Lreddish tinge is noticeable and quickly discounts it as paint. A few iron
&+Lshelves line the wall of this entryway. Glass jars of a pink-fleshy substance
&+Lreside within the containers on the shelf. A pungent, almost metallic odor
&+Lfills the room assaulting ones senses. It is unclear if the odor emanates from
&+Lthe many jars and vials on the shelves or from the red tinged walls. Small
&+Lpuddles of the &+Rred &+Lliquid have dried on the floor and appear as though
&+Lsomeone emptied a large container of the red contents. A gate leads to the
&+Lcavern outside.&n

&+mEntryway to a Tower of Black Stone&n~
&+L   A vaulted ceiling curves upward supported by thick beams of dragon bone.
&+LThe beams look as though they are from the ribcage of a great red dragon. The
&+Lspinal column positioned as the main supporting beam stretching the length of
&+Lthe ceiling. The rib cage, arching outward and down, providing the foundation
&+Lfor the arched ceiling. The flooring, covered with a strange silk
&+Ltapestry, provides a soft cushion as one glides across the room. Tall columns
&+Lof stone extend from the floor to the ceiling. The top of the columns spread
&+Lout blending into the bone ribcage of the ceiling. The added support providing
&+Lincreased protection for the tower should a massive earthquake, or tremor
&+Lwhich is a daily occurence in the underdark, strike to topple the dwelling.&n

&+Lcolor. The stone has a faint reddish tinge to it and it is as one peers
&+Lclosely that they realize the slime that covers the walls is actually blood.
&+LUnlike the illithid enslavers the neogi would rather eat their captured prey
&+Lversus keeping them too long as slaves. The amount of psionic control too
&+Ltaxing on their minds forcing them to feed much more frequently than their
&+Lillithid allies. The blood, dried in some areas, releases a metallic odor into
&+Lthe air. The stairs appear to continue to the top of the tower.&n

&+MThe Summoning Chamber of the Neogi&n~
&+L   Like their illithid allies, the neogi are adept at psionic combat. Hating
&+Lall races, the neogi tolerate the tentacled illithids as their goal, to
&+Lenslave all of Duris, is of mutual interest. Having dwelled on the astral
&+Lplanes, this room is now used by the neogi queen to summon her dominions from
&+Ltheir homeworld to the illithid city of Ixxillikor. It is from this city that
&+Lthe neogi and illithid join forces to raid the surface world of Duris or
&+Lto roam the caverns beyond to enslave any underdark denizens that they happen
&+Lto discover while on patrol. The neogi queen, often conversing through means
&+Lof telepathy with the elder brain, is in total coordination with the illithid
&+Lforces. As such, it is rare that an illithid and neogi raiding party come back
&+Lwithout a trail of enslaved beings.&n

&+yThe pit is ringed by large stalagmites forming a protecive fence should one

&+ybystanders. A throng of illithid seem intently engaged on the activities
&+ywithin the arena. Two slaves fight each other within the confines of the ring,
&+yno doubt under the compulsion of one of the nearby illithids.  These fights
&+yseem to be a popular pastime in the city, with many of the illithids coming

&+mA Ledge Overlooking the Elder Brain&n~
&+L   Sitting in a chamber filled with brain matter and pink fluids is the
&+Lelder brain. The massive flesh just beyond the stone ledge on which one now
&+Lstands. Drow slaves stand nimbly along the edges serving the needs of their
&+Lmaster. None able to resist the awesome psionic control sent out in waves by
&+Lthe elder brain. The ledge surrounding the elder brain is encased in glass
&+Lwith small holes in which lost fluid is refed back into the chamber. With each
&+Lmental manipulation created by the elder brain, large amounts of pink liquid
&+Lsplash against the glass and leak onto the ledge. A drow slave empties brain
&+Lmatter from a jar into the chamber. A walkway, just to the south extends out
&+Lfrom the ledge and hovers just above the elder brain.&n

&+Mliquid reaches a height of about five feet. Swimming in the liquid are small
&+Mtadpole looking creatures. Once matured into illithids, they will rise from
&+Mbriny liquid and step onto this walkway to take their place in the city of
&+MIxxillikor. A drow slave stands nearby pouring a vase of brain matter into the
&+Mchamber. A ripple in time pulsates through the room as the elder brain
&+Mfeeds on the liquid. Its psionic energy radiates in waves throughout this

&+mThe Southern Wall of a Massive Cavern&N~
   &+mA rocky and nearly-unstable ledge juts out from the massive
&+mcavern wall to the north.  This ledge provides passage around the
&+mmassive cavern to the north, which stretches far below until the
&+mdarkness.  Even the most potent ultravision would not grant
&+mvisability all the way into the abyss of the cavern below. Unlike
&+mthe ledge to the west, the rocky outcropping here offers very
&+mlittle and quite unstable support.
