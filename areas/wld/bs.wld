On a Dark Trail~
   A dark lonely path, shrouded in mist, snakes its way through
the menacing woods of the Svalich region.  Animals can be heard
nearby, the types of which can not be identified.  Planted firmly
in the ground is a spear with a skull dangling off of it.  The skull
seems to have some message etched into it.  The trail continues north
from here.

The skull has a message etched into it which says:

   To the northwest lies the Bloodstone cemetery.
   To the north lies the Keep of Bloodstone.
   Beware all who would give alms to the poor.

E
spear~
  This wicked looking spear would make a great weapon were it not planted
so deeply into a rock.  From that shaft of the spear, a skull dangles.

On a Dark Trail~
   Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block
out all save a death-gray light.  The tree trunks almost touch.  The
thick, damp undergrowth presses in, making it impossible even to
see more than a few steps in any direction.  The trail has the silence
of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unsounded scream.

Split in the Dark Trail~
   Suddenly, the road splits into the forbidding Svalich woods.  The
western fork slants down slightly to the west while the upwardly trail
looks to head north.  A cold autumn wind whistles down the western
lane, cutting icily through your clothing.  Dead brown leaves rush
about.  There is no sound other than the wind and leaves.

&+LThe Black Gate&N~
   The gate is very impressive, standing some thirty feet high.  It is made
of an unknown black alloy.  The bars on the gate are etched with a foriegn
alphabet.  On occassion, a blue electricity pulses though the alloy like
blood through an artery.  Cobwebs hang from the dust-covered bars of this
massive barrier.  The dust and webs cast strange, moving shadows across
the faces of stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the pilars which
support the gate.  Beyond its black iron bars can be seen some sort
of glow.  There is a key hole on the gate.

   The ledge looks to be made out of a swirl of molten iron and
granite.  The smooth surface is completely black, and has become
somewhat slippery thanks to the morning's dew.  The wind here kicks
up the grey mist that had been hugging the ground, and cuts right
down to the bone.  Riding in on the back of the wind are noises
that are both foriegn and menacing.  Flecks of dirt, sand, and
debris fire down at the ledge, polishing its surface.  A quick
flash of lightning exposes these unfamiliar surrondings, but the

   This trail seems to head north through this dark region.  Bones are
scattered all over the trail and the numerous large piles of dung make
this trail that much more dangerous.  A thick, cold fog spreads a pallor
over the trail.  Giant tree trunks stand on both sides of the trail, their
branches clawing into the mist.  Above, the wind gallops through the
forest canopy, but down here all is still.  Leaves plucked from nearby
trees fall and splash down into the low laying fog causing a temporary

poles.  The poles stand errect so as to let the bodies hang freely as a

        Greetings traveler-
                To the north lies the Valley of Truth and beyond that
        the mighty Keep of Bloodstone.  To the west is the lair
        of the manticore.  The road ahead has consumed many of your type
        and skill.  For those who make it to the Valley of Truth, remember
        that the forest is thick, and the path to Bloodstone is easy to
        over look.  Mind you well here, else become a part of the road.

A Drop On the Sinister Trail~
   The trail takes a steep turn downwards for a brief moment.  The
path here seems to traverse through a hole where pehaps a tree has
been ripped out.  This trail is lined with spikes for would be travelers
to fall on.  The trail leads through a dark forest which engulfs all
light from both the sun and the moon.  Howls can be heard, but their
direction is not definable.  The trees of the Svalich forest seem to to
reach for the heavens here.  Deep within the silence of this evil forest,
death surely waits.

Intersection in the Road of the Dead~
   The road is flanked by bodies which have been impaled by long wooden
poles.  The poles stand errect so as to let the bodies hang freely as a
warning to would be travelers.  The road is paved by what looks to be
some kind of cobblestone and yet there is something very different to

  The trail is covered with five inches deep in mud, and travel is very

is the only audible noise.  Field mice try desparatly to navagate across

something was driving them.  Occasionally, a mouse stops and seems to
whince in pain, turning circles on its side.  A momment later, the mouse
sinks to far into the mud and is eventually consumed entirely.  A
lightning bolt shatters the eeirie silence and briefly disturbs the
blood-red sky.  With the added light of the flash, a picket fence made

whince in pain, turning circles on its side.  A momment later, the mouse

In an Abandoned Home~
   The interior of the house is well furnished, although the fixtures show
sign of considerable wear.  Obvious oddities are the boarded-up windows
and the overuse of holy symbols.  The stench in the house is quite horrible
but the home is a nice rest from the mud.  Whoever lived here got wise
enough to get the hell out.  There is a note on the floor.

   I lived alone, my mind was blank.  I needed time to think to get the
memories from my mind.  What did I see?  I cannot believe, that what I
saw that night was real and not just fantasy.  Just what I saw, in my
own dreams were the reflections of my woman staring back at me.  Because
in my dreams, it's always there, that evil face that twists my mind and
brings me to despair.  I have the fire, I have the force, I have the
power to make my evil take its course...sacrafice is going on tonight.

these catacombs.  The air is think and musty, each breath is a struggle.
You can't but help notice that the walls are covered in some type of
muck, and that the floor seems to be alive.  The only other thing
noticeable is the awful smell of death.

&+rIn the Tomb of Tranth&N~
   This is the resting place of Baron Tranth fifth lord of the Keep.
The walls surrounding this room are made up of gems of all sorts.
There is an ambient light but no source is definable.  In the center
of the room is a stone carved coffin with chalk white scriptures
written upon it.  The floor is thick with dust and dirt, however
in some spots the floor is exposed.  The glimmer from the floor is
impressive.  It seems that the floor is glazed with a layer of gold.
Several vials with the residue of many colorful potions lay here
scattered about.  A long piece of ripped white linen has gotten
snared on the corner of the stone coffin.  Quite noticeable are some
&+ymuddy&N tracks which lead out of this room.

Entrance to the Valley of Truth~
   Here lies the entrance to the Valley of Truth.  Beyond leads to
darkness and untold horrors.  The wind whips through here and cuts
like the edge of a fine sword.  The walls of this entrance appear
to covered with the hides of adventurers.  Human, dwarven, elven, and
other forms can be made out in this mosiac of death.

On a Path through a Forested Valley~
   The path runs east to west, cutting through this incredibly
thick region of the Svalich woods.  During certain seasons, the
wind shoots down this path at super velocities.  Because of this,
most of the dense forest here is gnarled and lay close to the
ground.  Above the canopy, a large black gate can be seen resting
upon a cliff to the north.  A huge wooden throne is set back into
the thickets.  On each throne sits a pale, solitary skeletal being
wearing a brown, hooded robe.

&+LThe Black Gate&N~
   The gate is very impressive, standing some thirty feet high.  It is made
of an unknown black alloy.  The bars on the gate are etched with a foriegn
alphabet.  On occassion, a blue electricity pulses though the alloy like
blood through an artery.  Cobwebs hang from the dust-covered bars of this
massive barrier.  The dust and webs cast strange, moving shadows across
the faces of stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the pilars which
support the gate.  Beyond its black iron bars can be seen some sort
of glow.  There is a key hole on the gate.  There is a sign cast
aside here collecting dust.

sign~
		   Alas, the dark cloud of the Witch-King Zhengyi still
		rests heavy upon the Bloodstone barony.  First was
		the loss of the mines.  Human and dwarven workers,
		toiling deep beneath the earth, awakened a nameless
		evil, and death stalked the mines.  The now abandoned
		mine shafts are redolent with evil, and at the bottom,
		demons and succubi await new victims eagerly.  Even
		with such a loss, the barony still survived.  But now,
		the evil has risen and infected the minds of all
		within the Keep's walls.  The once pure and noble
		citizens now have hearts blacker than the eyes of
		Orcus.  With each new day, the evil sickness seemed
		to spread.  My only hope lay in the magic of this
		black barrier.
		   I am old and my time is almost at hand.
		I go now to prepair for my eternal slumber in the
		Bloodstone Graveyard.   Those who wish to
		travel beyond the black gate must search me
		out, for I am the keeper of the key.
				    -Tranth, Fifth Baron of Bloodstone

   This is a nicely manicured garden.  Rows of tulips bloom against
a backdrop of crisp green shrubary.  The sounds of singing birds
spring from the branches of a drooping willow tree.  A grand feeling

&+yOn a Dirt Path&N~
   This a path made up of staw and dirt which seems to be host to
numerous foot prints.  A pile of dung a foot wide rests in the middle
of the path.  The sound of striking metal oscillates through the air.
Wave after wave of the piercing pitch comes and goes, leaving only
the sound of buzzing horse flies.  An awful order wafts by bringing
with it a churning sensation in your belly.
   To the north is a tree.  To the south are the Keep's stables.

a weapon smith sharpens a saber's blade upon a spinning stone.
Behind a pair of open doors a man fans and stokes a white hot
furnace of coals.  The heat vapors plume out of the fire causing
the weapon smith to look blurry for a moment.  There is a man
sitting behind the counter waiting for you to decide.  There is

&+RBloodstone Stable&N~
   From here, the sounds of many horses are heard.  The place smells like
expected, and breathing is uncomfortable.  On the walls are numerous
tools for removing and shoeing horses.  The sound of a smith pounding
an anvil can be made out.  A burly looking woman named Helda is
here waiting to serve you.

   Many exotic animals from throughout the realms are here on
display.  Huge cages line the perimeter of the shop, some empty,
but most contain vicious looking companions.  The floor here is
covered with sawdust, which helps to mask out the awful smell of
urine.  Many books line the wall containing information about
various pets.

   This is the store room of Trenton the Adventurer.  Along the floor
are many large crates and sacks.  The squeel of rats and the patter
of their feet can be heard as they scamper across the wooden floor.
Above, through the cracks in the plank floor, shadows and movement

   This is the fourth level of the prison.  Its criminal element is
starting to look very tough.  The shadows hold more sinister element
than most wish to encounter.  A faint sound of moaning can be heard, not
one of agony, but a moan of some perverted pleasure.  Outlines of
inmates enjoying each other is enough to make even the most seasoned
adventurer sick.  The windows here are all boarded up, and very little
light manages to reach these poor lost souls.  To the west an iron door.

A cheap candle chandelier provides just enough light to make one's

called 'employees' of this place.  The room contains two doors, both
with a crack of light escaping from underneath.  Various sounds, can
be made out. The door to the west is made of &+Liron&N and the door

   The walls of the room are covered with old and cheap looking
tapestry.  The plank floor creaks loudly as you move to get a
better view of the room.  The room is fairly plain with the
exception of a huge bed.  The bed dominates the entire room, and
with the help of two candles at each side, movement can be seen!
To the rear is the door you just came through.

The Base of the Dead Paladin Tree~
   A gnarled old oak tree stands here, twisted by the winds of the
Svalich Region for well over 200 years.  The roots of this ancient
sentinel sprawl out over the damp ground drawing up the nutrients
in the soil.  In the branches of the tree swing the corpses of
many paladins whose armor and bare bone sparkle in the putrid smelling
breeze.  Above are many branches which are home to birds and small animals.
To the south is a dirt path.

The bodies of many paladins are suspended here by barbed chains.  They

appears to have been pecked away or eaten by some sort of animal.

   The sounds of many animals can be heard here in this wind chime of

&+CThe Inn of Clowns&N~
   Along one wall of this inn are ancient and worn looking maps.
Opposite these unusual decorations is a wooden wall carved with
scenes from battles long ago.  To the rear, is a long oak counter
with orc hide posters pined to it.  A quick glance at the floor
reveals a mosiac of various sizes and types of teeth.  Furniture
is scattered about this lobby which looks less than inviting.
A fire smolders in a large stone place, and a large fat man sits
infront staring off at nothing.  Behind the counter is Stephan,
the inn keeper.

In the Dead Paladin Tree~
   The sounds of many animals can be heard here in this wind chime of
death.  The leaves here are covered with droplettes of blood and animal
excretion.  A breeze blows through the tree, making it both sway the
poor bastards below and rattle the leaves all around.  The air around here
is fresh and crisp, but on occasion the smell of decay wafts by.

   Stretching towards the heavans are a pair of eloborate pilars which
come together.  The pilars are carved with beautiful ornate figures.

bronze pole.  At the tip of the pole, a purple flame burns.

smell of decay, the breeze also thick with thousands of small
biting flies.  Aside from a gnarled looking oak, nothing else is
here worthy of mention.

and even the head of a gnome decorate the bar's walls.  Broken
chairs are heaped up in one corner, evidence of some bar room brawl.
A spitoon is at one end of the bar, in dire need of being emptied.

At the Foot of a Crumbling Trail~
   Cut into the side of the gorge's shear walls is a trail which
is barely visible.  The trail leads upwards and disappears around
a bend.  The creek that was once trickling down the center of the
gorge has now stopped and the stone floor is dry.  Cloads overhead
swell and a sporatic wind shoots down the center of the gorge at
incredible velocities.

Mound of Shale In a Narrow Gorge~
   Here neatly piled up some five feet high is a pile of loose shale
stone.  No sign of how this came to pass, but one thing is certain,
somebody or something created this heap of rock.  The water that
had been trickling down the basin of the gorge has been collecting
here behind the stone dam and has formed a small pool of muddy
water.

On a Path through some Woods~
   The path cuts through the lower region of the Svalich woods.  A
mist snakes its way upon the ground of the dense forest which flanks the
trail.  A squirrel pops its head up out of the mist occassionly to collect
its bearings.  The sound of snapping branches, and the panting of some
creature originate from within the forest.  The sounds are only a few feet
away but yet the dense growth in these woods conceal their creators.  Though
the mist conceals much of what lay ahead, it is possible to note that
the trail seems to extend quite a ways.

floor to be somewhat slippery.  Above a crumbling trail rises

   Millions of small pebbles are dumped here in a makeshift path.
Dust from the road is kicked up in the wind causing the air to be
thick with dirt.  A lonely leaf tumbles along the gravel turning
circles in the wind.  Small puddles of water, unable to seep through
the pebbles, are scattered over the gravel.  To the east smoke can
be seen billowing out of village chimney stacks.  The smell of
roast stirge wafts by causing your mouth to swell with saliva.  To
the west a better look at the Keep can be seen.  From this vantage
point one is able to see how the Keep is strategically placed,
practically built into the side of large sheer volcanic face.

   The ground is soaked with the excretes of these damned birds.
The thick goo makes walking through the pen very precarious.  A
slip here, and these blood thirsty bastards will spring upon you.
This stirge muck fouls air leaving a bitter taste in one's palate.
Around the the pen are holes dug in various sizes.  These holes
act as a nest for these creatures to roost upon.  Feathers
litter the ground everywhere.  Some of the feathers have markings
similar to those seen on wild stirge in the forest, while others
look different.  To the north is an iron gate.

   A fire crackles slightly and fills the room with an ambient glow.
On a spit, turning slow cycles over the flames, is a roasted stirge.
The home is modestly furnished boasting numerous chairs, a long table,
and a comfortable looking high chair by the fire.  Hanging from
one wall is a basket of dried fruit and just below is a book shelf.
A large wooden stair way leads up.

   Six or seven beds line the walls of this large room.  Clothes
and toys are heaped about and in disarray.  One wall has a good
size wash basin, grimy from neglect.  Beside most of the beds
are wooden tables hosting candles.  A warm fire burns at one
end of the room providing valuable heat.  Resting upon a mantle
above the fire are a few portraits.  A peg, nailed into the wall
next to the fire, holds a pair of long underwear.

&+yIn a Foul Ditch&N~
   A pond of water and urine, stale and sluggish, fills the bottom
of this trench.  Bergs of white foam cruise the liquid's surface
aimlessly.  The still water is disturbed every now and then by the
bobbing of a fecal buoy.  Hordes of blood sucking flies swarm
over the pond, diving after a piece of the surfacing logs.

&+ROn a Red Cobble Road&N~
   The villagers have managed to complete this section of the road
and have layed down a nice red brick pavement.   Piles of brick are
stacked along the road and will be laid down as soon as the gravel
can be manicured properly.  Along this street, many homes can be
seen.  Bordering this fine road is a long communal bed of vegatibles
which looks recently harvested.

In a Village Home~
   Six or seven beds line the walls of this large room.  Clothes
and toys are heaped about and in disarray.  One wall has a good
size wash basin, grimy from neglect.  Beside most of the beds
are wooden tables hosting candles.  A warm fire burns at one
end of the room providing valuable heat.  Resting upon a mantle
above the fire are a few portraits.  A peg, nailed into the wall
next to the fire, holds a pair of long underwear.

   A fire crackles slightly and fills the room with an ambient glow.
On a spit, turning slow cycles over the flames, is a roasted stirge.
The home is modestly furnished boasting numerous chairs, a long table,
and a comfortable looking high chair by the fire.  Hanging from
one wall is a basket of dried fruit and just below is a book shelf.
A large wooden stair way leads up.

   The ladder, some one hundred feet in height, is made merely of a
thin trunk with pegs planted firmly into each side.  The ladder bends
and flexes under the weight of its passengers but seems most capable of

hits the face of the shear granite wall infront of you, and bounces
back into your face.  Above looks to be some type of level plateau.

&+wLarge Courtyard in the Temple&N~
   This is a large, cobblestoned courtyard, with a single, ill-tended
olive tree in the very center, with scant few branches still alive.
The courtyard is walled to the east and west by several buildings,
constructed from blocks of stark, gray granite.  All of the doors and
windows have been barred, and well-locked from the inside; evidently,
security is a very important issue in this temple.  Animal
dung lends a faint but noticeable aural stain to the air.  The courtyard
continues to the north, and the gates lay to the south.

   This is a large, cobblestoned courtyard, each stone an ill-smoothed
lump of discard granite, pooryly set into the ground.   Walking on this
surface is slightly treacherous, as each stone tends to wobble when trod
upon.  The buildings that line this courtyard are all locked and barred
from within, save a single, open door to the west.  A neglected arboretum
lies to the north, and the courtyard continues to the south.

   This was once a fine stand of trees of the most luxuriant, shade

They appear as if they are barely clinging to life.  The walking
surface is little more than very damp, dank earth, strewn about with
ages of dead branches and the rather frequent deposit of animal dung.
The arboretum is fenced in on three sides by a stern, stark granite
wall, with the only exit lying south, to the courtyard.

&+LIn Claw Alley&N~
   The alley is flanked at each side by towering walls of speckled
granite.  Quite noticeable, are a number of deep claw marks which
look to have been created many centuries ago.  At first, their age
is hard to figure, but after closer inspection, it becomes obvious
that only after many years could this wall be this worn.  The alley

musty air.  To the north is a tavern.

   The alley is flanked at each side by towering walls of speckled
granite.  Quite noticeable, are a number of deep claw marks which
look to have been created many centuries ago.  At first, their age
is hard to figure, but after closer inspection, it becomes obvious
that only after many years could this wall be this worn.  The alley

&+RThe Dead Ogre&N~
   The tavern is host to the trophies of this realm's mighty adventurers.
Along the perimeter of the tavern walls, close to the plank wooden ceiling,
is a multitude of stuffed ogre heads.  The warriors of Bloodstone pride
themselves on raids to Faang, famed ogre domain.  Below the numerous
trophies, and dividing this room in two, is a long wooden counter.  Just
behind the counter are shelves stocked with all the finest beverages
that can be found.  A few chairs sit stacked neatly in one corner of the
room, ready to be broken out in time of celebration.  There is a huge
sign hanging on one of the tavern's walls.

&+RRear of the Dead Ogre&N~
   This room looks gutted from fire, furniture burned and the walls
covered in thick layers of black soot.  Broken glass, and piles of
charred cloth lay scattered all about the floor.  A solid river of
wax streams down one wall where several candles were melted.  Off
to one corner of the room is a potted plant, once errect, which is
shrivled into a brittle clump.  A solid iron door, discolored from
the apparent fire, is to the west.

dances to some unheard melody.  Light, as well as heat, from the

barrier.  On one side of the platform, are some hanging bags of sand.
There, students of thievery practice there skills and backstab the
swaying bags furiously.  Yet in another part of this huge platform,
the Grandfather of Thieves sits surrounded by his disciples.  It is
there, where the Grandfather talks of technique, and reveals much of
the knowledge of the thief.

   Two skulls stand guard at each side of the bridge.  Their eye
sockets gleam, and occasionally the jaw of one will move.  The
other then responds, but no sound is audible.  The bridge spans
a moat deeper than any canyon in the realm.  Not water, but
fiery lava flares and bubbles in the distant depths, although
mostly all that can be seen is the orange glow on the dark stone
sides of the moat.

   Towering arches and pilars extend upwards in what seems to be forever.
Mounted here are a number of bone guns which look as if they could

like catapults.  They are apparently used to launch airel assults on
invaders trying to cross the bridge.  Most likely the spray of their
attacks sends the poor creatures to a fiery demise below.  Faint sounds

&+RAt a Pile of Bones Along The South Wall of the Keep&N~
   Stacked upon each other as if to form some type of objects are
the gnawed femur bones of some poor bastards.  It looks as if
some creature was amusing itself with a morbid variation of
lincoln logs.
   Towering walls of the keep seem to reach the sky.  On the opposite
side of this narrow path horrible screams can be heard.  A quick
glance below through the burning smoke and the scalding vapor reveals
a brilliant river of fire.  Down in the fiery mote filled with lava,
demons with pitchforks jab at pitiful screaming people trying to escape
the awful pain.

&+LOn a Bed of Ancient Lava&N~
   Rising high above this smooth, black, and glossy surface are the
eastern walls of the Keep.  Looming just beyond those walls is the
infamous prison of Bloodstone.  Dark smoke billows from small cracks
in the lava bed.  The air is very hot here, causing the upper dermis
on exposed parts to ash.  Not only is the air scalding, but it is also
thick with a humid musk.  At intervals steam erupts through areas of
broken surface.  To the south, the orange glow from the fiery moat
can be seen.  To the north the bed continues.

&+LSpouting Mud on a Bed of Ancient Lava&N~
   Here is a pool of scalding mud, slowly simmering in a cauldron
of solid lava rock.  The pool of mud gurgles as rising gas explodes
through its thick surface.  An old rusty sword hilt can be seen
barely protruding at the edge of this earthen lake.  Perhaps some
foolish adventurer became to brave, and unwisely explored this
vial sector.

&+LAt the Foot of a Shear Cliff~
   Rising high above this smooth, black, and glossy surface are the
eastern walls of the Keep.  The lava bed ends here smack up against
a wall.  The Keep continues and from this perspective, it is obviously
layed back into the mountain.  There is no way up this shear cliff as
it is made of the same glassy smooth lava rock that the bed is made
out of.  The builders of the Keep were wise indeed to choose such a
location which makes defending this fortress a trivial matter.
To the south, the orange glow from the fiery moat can be seen.

   The southern wall stops abrubtly here and forges itself
into the side of a black mountain face.  There is no way
up this shear cliff as it is made of a glassy smooth lava rock.
The builders of the Keep were wise indeed to choose such a
location which makes defending this fortress a trivial matter.
To the south, the orange glow from the fiery moat can be seen.
A bridge extends to the east, over the lava river.

&+RNaked Tree Along The South Wall of the Keep&N~
   Here standing smack in the middle of the path is a gnarled oak
whose bark has been clawed off.  Perhaps the bark has been removed
as a territorial sign, or perhaps as a means to keep some creatures
claws sharp.  The heat from the lava bed below causes the tree to
sweat, beads of sap slowly dripping from its bare trunk.

&+yOn a Dam of Svalich Wood&N~
   Long trunks of ancient Svalich timber lay one on top of the other
to form a crude dam.  Green algae heaves to and fro, as a nearby river
slaps into the eastern side of this wooden structure.  Wooden poles act
as hand rails, which are firmly planted into the wooden planks that line
the top of the dam.  The dam slows down the advancing water, and disperses
it into nearby pools.  The pools, which are barely waist deep on a human,
are small fisheries which produce some of the suculant dishes that the
Baron demands.

&+YOn a Sandy Embankment&N~
&+Y   A dune, of soft warm sand is piled up here which overlooks a thrashing&N
&+Ypool of water below.  The wind blows gently here, but it is enough to&N
&+Ysend granules of rock a flying through the air.  Tall reeds grow close&N
&+Ybottom of the dune, where the cool water makes the perfect mud for them&N
&+Yto grow in.  Tracks of some animal, lead from just behind the dune to&N
&+Ythe sparkling shore of the pool.  Indeed, a number of small cats can&N
&+Ybe seen prowling in the reeds.&N

&+yOn a Dam of Svalich Wood&N~
   Long trunks of ancient Svalich timber lay one on top of the other
to form a crude dam.  Green algae heaves to and fro, as a nearby river
slaps into the eastern side of this wooden structure.  Wooden poles act
as hand rails, which are firmly planted into the wooden planks that line
the top of the dam.  The dam slows down the advancing water, and disperses
it into nearby pools.  The pools, which are barely waist deep on a human,
are small fisheries which produce some of the suculant dishes that the
Baron demands.

   The river's water is a bit deeper here, giving way to dark blue pools.
The crystal water allows you to view all the sparkling fish which hide
deep beneath its surface.  Small swirls turn in quick revolutions, pulling
down tiny leaves and insects.  Circular ripples radiate outwards from varies
sights on the pools surface.   The ripples are caused every now and then
by a fish jumping for a bite of the thick layer of insects hovering inches
out of reach.  A dam, just to the west, prevents these fish from going
any further down river.

Small leaves sail slowly down the water's surface, indicating that there

&+bchurn with the large number of fish penned up here in this fluid corale.&N
&+bA dam built along the finges of this pool, keeps the water high enough&N
&+bto keep this fishery successful.  From this vantage point, a large&N
&+bfunnel of thatched stick can be seen swaying gently in the under water&N
&+bcurrents.  The funnel is starts at the base of the dam, and grows&N
&+bto a very small circumference when it reaches the center of the pool.&N
&+bApparently, this thatched funnel is used to direct fish into the pond.&N
&+bOnce here, they cannot seem to find there way back through to the river&N
&+bon the other side of the dam.&N

In the center of the square is a good size pit containing white
hot coals, apparently placed here to keep the spectators warm.

&+BShrine on the Street of Tears&N~
   A small shrine of stone has been erected here, just to one side
of this lane of sparkling tears.  Heaps of flowers have been layed
down at the foot of this repository of sorrow.  Burning slowly,
one at each side of a leather parchment, are long slender candles
of white wax.  The candles lend a soft light, enough to see the elaborate
etching of a man's face on the wrinkled leather sheet.  As the wind
blows slightly,  the candles flicker and go out for a brief moment.
Once the wind has ceased, the flames return to their hosts of wax
and dutifully continue to burn.

for two humans to sit down upon.  At the foot of each bench is
a small stick of cedar burning, perhaps left by a widow in

&+BOn the Street of Tears&N~
   Tiny glass beads, a by product of the nearby mining refinery, have been
used to pave much of this splendid road.  The beads are ecliptical wonders,
each smooth and lustreous.  The beads though stunningly beautiful, represent
long and dangerous toils of the men far below in the Mines of Bloodstone.
The street is said to have gotten its name from the many wives who stroll
its length and begin to cry at the thought of their interned loved one.
Torches, planted on long slender poles, send light dancing through the bumpy
street below.  The light splits as it hits each tear of glass, a hundred
million prisms dancing under its wavering radiance.

&+YAt Crow's Crossing&N~
   Three roads converge here in what is called the Crow's Crossing.
The square is slightly underkept, and the stone statues which
round its perimeter add to the dreary scenery.  A layer of thick
and foul smelling air clings to this place, most likely due to
the garbage dumps to the east.  In the center of the square an
ancient looking tree grows, gnarled and whithered from years of
natural abuse.  The long branches reach out in all directions,
clawing at those who pass by.  Sitting in the branches, high
above the square, is a flock of crows cackling loudly.  The ground
below is soaked with the white goo that comes from birds which
hang about in one place for to long and from this, it can be seen that
these crows are regulars.

   The long slender ladder, which has lead upwards, opens up into
a good size rise, a small village on stilts.  Many large barrels
are stacked neatly in one corner of the platform here, filled to
the top with sand.  The sound of a man shouting prices nearby can
be heard among many other voices.  As one moves across the planked
wooden floor of the platform, the boards begin to squeel sending and
uncomfortable noise through the air.  Torches, planted firmly into
the floor and hoisted high by a long thin pole, flutter under the
influence of the cool wind.

   Large wheels of granite spin at fearsome rates, each revolution sanding
away at large uncut red stone.  Running back and forth across the ceiling are
a number of long wooden gutters.  Each gutter directs a slow trickle of water,
and drops the cool fluid down over the stone cutting wheels below.  Apparently
the water is needed so as not to crack the stone with the heat caused by the
grinding friction.  The water comes from a small window up near the ceiling.
Through the window, a bucket attached to a wheel can be seen droping water
into a holding well.  The wooden plank floor here sparkles from the thick layer
of stone shavings being spewed forth from each of the grinding wheels.

pool of thrashing water, contained in some type of wooden bin, occupies
one full wall of this rather large room.  The pool is used to clean away
debris from the ore, and to isolate the tiny crystals contained within
for assimilation. In two small barrels directly beside the pool, these
tiny crystals can been seen awaiting meltdown.  A rope pulley hangs over
head, just above a very tight shaft which is cut into the floor.  Large
buckets of moist rock are hoisted up from below with the help of this
pully system.

&+YIn the Duty Room&N~
   A large board dominates the center of this room containing the
work assignments for the Keep's miners.  Shouts of toil can be
heard emanating from the east as a gush of stale air rushes forward.
The air smells as if it has been released for the first time, trapped
far below the Keep for thousands of years.  A litter of small benches
line the room where miners are to wait for there foremans.  A quick
glance downwards upon the wooden floor reveals a thick layer of
dirt and debris. The particles are most likely transported in the
frequent giesers of air which spout upwards from the shafts below.

&+YIn the Miner Ready Room&N~
   Rows of benches stand across the wooden plank floor here, each
long and sturdy, capable of supporting a dozen or so miners at a
single moment.  Pegs, possibly hundreds of them, line the walls so
as to make each of the wooden barriers look like a beard of two
days.  Apparently this stubble is used to hang up the mining gear
after the men far below surface and return home.  Under the pegs
and circling the room almost completely, are shelves standing not
even knee high.  A few pairs of muddy leather boots sit in these
racks, waiting for a new recruit to come and take them.

&+LAt the Entrance to the Mines of Bloodstone&N~
    Here, in the center of this dug out cavern, is a large open
shaft which leads down into a thick musty blackness.  Torches
set into the earthen walls struggle valiantly to stay lit as bursts
of stale air drive upwards.  Tethered to a pair of wooden stakes
is a ladder made of thick rope.  The ladder disappears as it descends
into the darkness of the mines.  Just above the shaft, is a pulley
used to retrieve the injured, or to lower down heavy equipment.
The sound of iron striking stone is carried up through the shaft
on the crest of a wave of choking dust.  As the gust of air subsides,
the dust falls and the minerals contained within sparkle under
the glowing ambient light of the dancing torches.

&+yOn a Heap of Decomposing Discards&N~
   The Keep's rubbish seems to find its way to this area.  Years of
spoiled meats, broken furniture, emptied rum bottles, and unwanted
wares have grown into a monolith of tangled debris.  Small armies
of rats fight each other over the smallest slice of this refuse territory; for
each square inch reveals many layers of succulent filth.  The so called
hill side here is hard to walk upon as the garbage creates a slippery
terrain.  The peek of a nearby garbage heap is covered completely with
bobbing black fowl.  Legions of crow have descended down upon a
load of fresh discards, feasting upon all the new delicacies.

&+yIn a Dale of Discards&N~
   On every side, a mound of garbage looms.  All the sweat of the
rotting meat,  urine of the small furry beasties, and the gooey
excretions of the fat black crows trickle down to this low point and
forms a thick yellow-green pool.  All about the fringes of this lumpy
pool of stench are colonies of blood thirsty pin worms.  The worms
bend and wriggle, each trying to get a lick of waste collecting here.
In the center of the pool, a lonely rat struggles for its life.  Apparently
it had lost its footing and tumbled down from the hillside.  As
the poor creature struggles to keep its tiny head above the think surface
hordes of stinging flies descend upon it in a mad fever.  The flies bite
at the rats eyes as well as the suffering creature's inner ear.  As the
rodent winces under the stinging pain, it sinks deeper into the foul
paste.

   Once a place of benign birth, the altar has been retrofitted
to the satisfaction of the current disposition of the Keep's
residents.  Once a place where worshipers could come and pay
their respects to the virtuous gods, such as Deneir or Selune,
the altar is now used to perform various acks of diabolical
cruelty by the followers of the dark lords.  This place, where once
flowers of splender were set down, now is host to the hairless heads
of victims taken in the name of infamous Bitch Queen Umberlee.  Four
candles, each identical in height and in blood red hue, burn brightly.
The candles provide enough light to reveal a sinister mosiac of human
scalps, each posted firmly to the wall directly behind.  The area of
this rug grows daily, as the minions of the dark one return proud,
mighty, and devoted their master.

the light entering from above is just enough to allow one to see
ahead.  The passage leads to the foot of a massive iron door.

&+LIn the Belly of the Altar's Cauldron&N~
&+L   A narrow lead opens up into a huge pocket of swirled granite.&N
&+LThe surface of the rooms walls is smooth and akin to dark black&N
&+Lglass.  High above, the walls converge into an even bowl which&N
&+Lcasts a faint reflection.  Circling the top periphery of the&N
&+Lchamber are a number of bloodstones, each glowing gem appearing&N
&+Lto feed of the evil radiance of this place.  The walls of black&N
&+Lglass melt into a cold stone floor, leaving a ripple about the&N
&+Lroom.  The excess of molten granite from the walls, which forms&N
&+Lthis ripple, is just about the right height to double as a bench.&N
&+LUpon the hard stone floor are a number of tiny crimson rugs, perhaps&N
&+Leach is large enough for two if they were of the friendly type.  Some&N
&+Lof the wool carpets are surrounded by stumpy fat candles which have&N
&+Lburned themselves down close to the ground forming a clump of molten&N
&+Lwax.  Sitting stagnate in the center of this chamber is a pool of murky&N
&+Lsludge.  Small bubbles erupt through its skin like surface releasing&N
&+Lputrid smelling sulfur gas. A sturdy door of iron lay off to the east.&N

   The walls have been stripped bare of their former decorations.
It is evident from the clean spots left behind, that the symbols
were holy in nature.  The sygils of Mystra, Selune, and Deneir can
be made out upon the dirt thickened walls, each a sign of the pure
virtue that once plagued the cathedral.  Smears of blood, spit, and
other bodily excretions now streak the walls heaping further insult
upon the fallen gods.  Each of these removed symbols represented
a rat of the Gold Aura, and the Keep's citizens will not adhere to
their weak beliefs any longer.
   To the north is a wooden door.  To the south the hall continues,

sharpen the edges of soon to be finished weapons.  The walls directly
behind the wheels lend some insight as to why the slaves act with
so much caution.  Each wall is tainted with the ground flesh of
some man's finger.  Some spots on the wall are dried, yet many more
are atleast one day fresh.  At one end of the room, a set of

&+wswirling fire.  The heavy lava is then pumped into steel moldings&N
&+wwhich produce the steel bars which are to be shaped into fine&N

&+wslaves can be seen running over to the fountain and dousing themselves&N

a stunning red avenue.  The bricks, each about the length of a human
infant's arm, has been glazed over.  The clear shiny glaze has

&+wsparkling ornaments.  A pair of sturdy looking guards sit and watch the&N
