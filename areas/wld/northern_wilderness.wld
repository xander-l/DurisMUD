   The floor of the quarry is rough from the uneven cuts of rock and
bits of loose gravel and chips of rock which are the natural result of
stone cutting. The quarry floor spreads out toward north and east.

   Once upon a time this was a well kept spot, centered about a larger
than life humanoid statue. The trees have encroached and thrust their
limbs around the statue, whose face has been blasted off. There is also
an arm missing, but that would seem to be part of the original design.
   A path leads north and there is evidence of a trail off through the
trees to the west.

scattered rocks on the dirt ground. A finely woven net hangs loosely from
the edges of the walls, keeping out snow and rain, but not cold or heat,

&+LAn Intersection of Tunnels&n~
   The larger north/south tunnel is intersected by a narrow east/west
tunnel. The openings leading east and west could more appropriately be
described as cracks than a true tunnel, although they are wide enough
to offer passage. A sliver of light penetrates from the north, where the
tunnel starts to decline.

&+yA Broad Ledge&n~
   This ledge protrudes from a gently sloping hill, overlooking an east-west
running valley. Directly across from the ledge, steep mountains rise up,
towering over the valley. The eastern flatland of the valley is taken up by
a large field, which appears to be cultivated. To the west in the valley
lies a collection of huts and shacks. A river runs through the north side
of the valley at the foot of the mountains. Leading down the hill from the
ledge is a dirt path, while a dark tunnel disappears into the hill southward.

village huts hut shacks shack town~
Not much more than a collection of huts, the village appears to be the
product of a fairly primitive society. The few buildings are all
single story, and created out of whatever was available at the time - rocks,
mud, and timber. A notable exception is a large rock and mud building that
sits apart from the village, in a clearing on the north side of the river,
directly across from the village.

Although the climate only allows for a short growing season here, the

continues northward, eventually meeting a three-way intersection.

&+LThe Entrance to a Dark Tunnel&n~
   A tunnel precariously dumps out onto the side of a hill, overlooking a
valley. Running east to west, the valley contains a field, directly north, and
a small community of huts and shacks further west. Across the valley, a river
runs from east to the west, apparently heading to the ocean. A path leads
