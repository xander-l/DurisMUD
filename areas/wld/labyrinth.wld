&+rEntrance &+Lto the &+wLabyrinth &+Lof &+rNo Return&N~
   There is a large cave here, the mouth of which reeks with the
pungent odor of death and decay. The darkness inside is depthless,
as no amount of sunlight seems able to penetrate into the cave. No
telling what evil creatures lurk within this cave that is the
entrance to the Labyrinth of No Return.

&+LA Dead End&n~
   This is nothing more than a dead end, one of many that await the
would-be adventurer that wanders into the Labyrinth of No Return.
A skull lies on top of a pile of bones here, staring at all who
should be unlucky enough to come here, where it had met its end.

&+LPassage in the &+wLabyrinth &+Lof &+rNo Return&N~
   This is a dark passageway in the labyrinth. The air is thick and
heavy, stale with the odor of death and decay. There are hardly any
sounds audible, but some sinister creature must reside within, for
there are bones strewn along the corridor, some of them humanoid. All
the passageways seem to look alike, making it very easy to get lost.

&+LPassage in the &+wLabyrinth &+Lof &+rNo Return&N~
   This is a dark passageway in the labyrinth. The air is thick and
heavy, stale with the odor of death and decay. There are hardly any
sounds audible, but some sinister creature must reside within, for
there are bones strewn along the corridor, some of them humanoid. All
the passageways seem to look alike, making it very easy to get lost.

water is deafening compared to the ambient stillness that pervades

stream is here, flowing forth from the pool of water.

   There is a murky stream here of cold, fast-moving water. The bed of
the stream is about knee high, and is very slippery. The banks of the
stream is composed of slick flowstone, which formed when thin films
of water deposited sheets of mineral along the ground.

there are bones strewn along the corridor, some of them humanoid. All

&+LPassage in the &+wLabyrinth &+Lof &+rNo Return&N~
   This is a dark passageway in the labyrinth. The air is thick and
heavy, stale with the odor of death and decay. There are hardly any
sounds audible, but some sinister creature must reside within, for
there are bones strewn along the corridor, some of them humanoid. All
the passageways seem to look alike, making it very easy to get lost.

&+LPassage in the &+wLabyrinth &+Lof &+rNo Return&N~
   This is a dark passageway in the labyrinth. The air is thick and
heavy, stale with the odor of death and decay. There are hardly any
sounds audible, but some sinister creature must reside within, for
there are bones strewn along the corridor, some of them humanoid. All
the passageways seem to look alike, making it very easy to get lost.

&+LA Dead End&n~
   This is nothing more than a dead end, one of many that await the
would-be adventurer that wanders into the Labyrinth of No Return.
A skull lies on top of a pile of bones here, staring at all who
should be unlucky enough to come here, where it had met its end.

&+WA Light at the End of the &+LTunnel&n~
   Oddly enough, the air here seems less stifling, and a light can
be seen at the end of this tunnel, to the east. Sounds of song and
laughter can be heard in the distance, and a feeling of joy and
happiness slowly ebbs in from the east.
