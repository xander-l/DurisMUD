&+gallowing the entire interior to be lit with only a few magical floating
&+gglow spheres. The patrons laugh and sing around the many tables, and
&+gthe true spirit of what joy means amongst the Elves conveys a sense
&+gof wonderful well being, and undeniable peace. In a place where open
&+gminds come to laugh and sing and share countless tales, no one can leave
&+gwithout having made a few friends and feeling a bit more content with
&+glife. A massive spiral staircase, as occupied with patrons as the main

&+gquality of performance of almost anywhere. Above the theater itself is
&+gthe canopy of the oak's own broadleaves, allowing sun to filter in like

&+gseats. The walls between the windows are lines with music sheets,
&+gsome of which still glisten with freshly applied ink. They detail
