&+g Forest Path~
&+gA forest spreads out in all directions. The forest contains many different
&+gspecies of trees, and some individual trees are obviously very ancient, with
&+gmassive trunks rising high above the forest floor.  There is also much scrub
&+gand brush growing on the ground between the trees, making it difficult to
&+geither walk or see for any distance.  Overhead the branches of the trees
&+goverlap, filtering the sunlight so that it barely illuminates the area. The
&+gremains of dead trees crisscross across the floor of the forest making
&+gpassage even more difficult.

&+gSeveral dead trees lie across the path ahead. The trees look like they have
&+glaid there for centuries and appear to have been almost fossilized. Behind
&+gthe dead trees is a deeper shadow which upon closer inspection is an opening
&+gin the hillside. It can be only be reached by squeezing through a small space

&+cThe opening is an entrance to a cave! On one side of the opening is faint
&+cmarkings on the face of the rock. The markings are too eroded to make out,
&+chowever, even to tell if they were natural or made by some long ago
&+cinhabitants. On the floor of the cave are many small rocks and boulders

&+r Ancient Cavern~
&+rThe cavern is very large with a high domed ceiling. On the walls of the
&+rhallway at regularly spaced intervals are the remains of what looks like
&+rsconces that might have been for torches. Mysteriously, they still emanate
&+rlight even though whatever they originally held has long since disintegrated
&+rinto dust. Strewn about are bits and pieces of what might have once been a
&+rhumaniod. It is hard to tell now.
