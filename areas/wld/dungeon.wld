&+yA Strange Entranceway~
   The entrance is nearly undectable from the vast amount of &+gshrubbery &Nand
&+ggrass &Ncovering the trapdoor. The entrance appears to be circular in shape
and about 5 feet in diameter.
   The &+gforest &+wseems to become silent as you peer into the darkness of the
trapdoor. The &+ytrapdoor &+witself looks to be made of &+yoak about 3 inches wide
&+wand is covered with &+gvines &+wmaking opening the door slightly difficult from
the sheer weight of the trapdoor.
    Back north is the &+gforest &+wwhile up seems to be a cliff which leads to
the top of the mountain this cave is in, however there are no handholds or
ladders to get up there.

   &+LIt's very dark in here&N. The room is also very narrow, you can hardly
squeeze through. The walls are covered in &+wvines and you can see scratched on
the wall the words "&+cNothing here&+w". The graffiti continues as you see the
words "&+cYeah, I'm here!&+w" and it ends with someone writing "&+cAw shut up Krog&+w".
   The tunnel seems clear of life as if this tunnel was shaped by humanoids
not naturally. Up leads back to the entrance of the cave.

made of &+ydirt &+wand &+gvines &+wand there is a very real danger that this room could
cave in killing you, but the room fortunately doesn't seem to be moving at
all or have a chance of caving in for awhile.
   Although the path seems to end here, the floor has very loose &+ydirt &+win
it and might even be concealing a hidden trapdoor.

with a light bright enough to cover the room. There is a desk at the north
end of the room which is covered with scrolls and books about strange
topics.
   The room only has a height of 5 feet, and is only 15 square feet across
making it difficult to move around. On the ground is a very old looking

Greetings,

   This dungeon is very dangerous with my last dying breath I write to
warn you of its danger. I have been over come by a Red Dragon and
escaped to this library to write my last words. Please reader, do not
continue any further to this dungeon.

&+LA &+LCave Junction~
   To the south through a small entranceway you can make out noises of some
humanoids moving around when down is a ladder made of steel which leads
deeper into this mysterious place.  Down is &+Ldarkness &Nwhich doesn't
seem to end but very faintly you can make
out the floor when south you can faintly make out some light most likely
from the settlement. It would appear to be a primitive settlement where some
danger could lie if the creatures that lived in it were aggressive to
outsiders.

a fate worse then death.
The east leads back to more spacious areas. You can feel faint blasts of
&+Rheat &Nfrom the tunnel too which makes going into the tunnel less fun by

&+WThe Summit~
   &+WSnow &+wremains all around you. Nothing here is to note since snow
covers all the secrets that could be here. The beautiful view of the &+gforest
remains and it's like you could stay here forever watching the view.
The entrance of the cave can be clearly seen from here.

A Guard &+LPost~
   This room is very primitive looking with huge &+yclubs &Nleaning against the
wall and animal furs on the ground.
   It's pretty big too about 20 square feet so several ogres can fit in here
and stand guard against intruders who'd accidently entered the ogre tribes
lair.
   Considering the plain decor of the room. The ogres who stay here don't
really care about the room at all.

homes. Pictures of &+mOgre gods &Nadorn the rooms intimidating you and the hard
stone floor has been replaced with soft dirty furs.
   It seems the more east you go the higher the class of ogres it reaches.
The ogres surprisingly seem to hold their gods in higher respect then other
ogre tribes, there must be powerful shamans and acolytes that live here.

   You can tell this is the entrance to the leaders home, because there is a

   You can either enter the home or leave back to the smashing noises north
and south, there is no sound from the Ogre Chief's home which adds a feeling
of danger to entering his home.

sides of the room.
   This house is bigger then other Ogre homes and this is the only home that
has shelves. The shelves contain bottles of &+yfoul smelling liquid &Nthat looks
very &+gpoisonous &Nshowing the chief must be an alchemist or something
similar to that. From the size of the room, this home could nearly
fit up to 15 ogres. The chief must be a highly respected (or feared) man.
