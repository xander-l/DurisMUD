   &+LHere, black and red stone meet in a clash of colors. A large circular
&+Lhole is here in the floor, emanating a reddish glow and heat. The heat isn't
&+Lunbearable, but it will make you sweat. Different shades of red line the
&+Lrim of the opening, and it looks as though it'll only fit one person through
&+Lat a time. Steam slowly wafts up from the opening and condenses on the

&+rThe Lair of the &+LDracolisk&n~
   &+gBones and several items, mostly ruined, lie strewn about the floor here.
&+gClaw marks decorate the walls and floor, like some great beast scratched at
&+gthe wall, trying to get out. The room smells awful, like decaying flesh and
&+goffal. The ceiling is relatively high here, about 45ft from the floor. To
&+gthe south, the ceiling becomes lower.&n

&+RPit of Fire&n~
   &+rThe walls of this vertical shaft consist of a fire red stone, and emits
&+rheat. Coarse in texture and in no pattern, the passage is naturally formed,
&+rand roughly circular in shape. Above, a red ceiling can be seen, drops
&+rfalling from above from the steam condensing. A strange sparkling plays
&+rover the surface of the stone and a curious lightness comes over any of
&+rthose close-by. The tunnel here leads to the north.&n

   &+rThis cavern is HUGE, the walls barely visible past the heat waves that

&+rand is dotted with small holes. A small pool of water is here, bubbling
&+rand steaming from the heat of the rock beneath. A small opening in the wall
&+rto the south leads up, and sucks in some of the steam created by the
&+rdifferent temperatures of the tunnels above, and the cavern here.&n
