&+LThe Base of a Fog Enshrouded Mountain&n~
&+y   A wide ravine snakes its way from the base of the mountain disappearing
&+yabout midway up the mountains length. From this spot, as one gazes up the
&+yravine they notice that this mountain is actually the largest of a set of
&+ysmaller rocky ranges. A dark set of storm clouds linger at the mountains peak.
&+yBright flashes of lightning suddenly illuminate the sky and what lies at the
&+yvery peak of the mountain. During the &+Wlightning &+yflashes one can barely make
&+yout what appears to be a set of castle walls.&n

&+LThe Bottom of a Wide Ravine&n~
&+y   Formed centuries ago as the great ice caps of Duris melted sending large
&+yglaciers of ice plummetting from the mountainous peaks to the lands below, a
&+ysingle large glacier carved this rocky ravine. Sheer walls of rock and granite
&+yborder the ravine. As one gazes about and takes measure of the path to be
&+ytraveled they quickly realize that should any bandits attack, that the only
&+yalternative will be to fight, for there is no where to flee. Large boulders
&+yare set into the ravine. The tops of the large rocks have been chiseled flat
&+yand appear to be set so as to form a crude set of steps. The steps being much
&+yto large to be walked upon except for those few races of giants that still
&+yinhabit the lands of Duris.&n

&+yTravelling Through a Rocky Ravine&n~
&+y   The ravine twists and turns through the side of the mountain. The natural
&+ypath formed as a great glacier slid from the mountains peak to the valley
&+ybelow centuries ago. Set at diagonal angles from each other are large
&+yboulders. The giant rocks appear to be set so as to form a crude set of
&+ystairs that lead up towards the mountains peak and also down to the valley
&+ybelow. Sheer walls of rock rise up from the mountainside and fully border the
&+yravine. The walls would appear to prevent anyone, including the most
&+yexperienced of thieves from scaling the walls for there are no crevices or
&+ycracks by which to make a firm grasp. As one gazes further along the ravines
&+ydistance, they notice that visibility becomes obscurred. A heavy mist of
&+ydark grey clouds blocks ones vision and the ravine begins to make numerous
&+ytwists and turns.&n

&+LA Wide Ledge Overlooking the Valley&n~
&+y   A wide ravine to the westt opens up onto this wide ledge overlooking the
&+yvalley below. As one peers down to marvel at the view they realize that they
&+ymust be close to the mountains peak for the tops of trees are all that's
&+yvisible below. A few vultures pass through the air below, having spotted the
&+ynights meal. The ledge itself, although wide, appears to be very thin. The
&+yblack granite rock contrasts sharply with the brown and grey rock of the
&+ymountain indicating that the ledge appears to be not a natural formation, but
&+yrather man made in attempt to reach the mountains peak.&n

&+LThe Base of a Storm Battered Ravine&n~
&+y   Dark thunderclouds linger along the mountainside. A fierce wind bellows
&+ythrough the ravine, pushing on ones body and making further travel more
&+ydifficult. Although the wind howls with a piercing wail, it does little to
&+ydisperse the clouds of billowing darkness. The clouds, often releasing bolts
&+yof lightning that strike in the distance, simply swirl in one places casting
&+ydark shadows along the path above. During the sudden flashes of lightning
&+yvisions of giants moving along the horizon enter ones mind. When the flashes
&+ysubside only darkness remains leaving one to guess as to the reality of their
&+yvision.&n

&+ystorm batters the ravine. Large balls of hail fall from the sky with
&+ytremendous force battering the edges of the ravine. The fierce wind rising
&+yover the top of the mountains peak and gaining force as it travels through the
&+ycenter of the mountain. As one walks along this path they feel as though a
&+ydragons breath is blowing against their body. Flashes of lightning seem to
&+yconstantly strike a specific spot just ahead in the mountains. The bright
&+yflashes of light fully illuminate the area if only for a brief second. During
&+ythese strikes one can see that the ravine being traveled has been widened so
&+ythat even large carts can be pulled up and perhaps to the other side.&n

&+ymountain. To the north one sees that there is an opening to a small cave in
&+ywhich one could take shelter from the ravaging storm. Large balls of hail fall
&+yfrom the sky with tremendous force battering the mountains rocky walls.
&+yThe fierce wind rising over the top of the mountains peak and gaining force as

&+yof souls. The thunder so loud that one would think the very mountain itself is
&+yabout to explode into volcanic eruption. The bright flashes of light fully
&+yilluminate the area if only for a brief second. During these strikes of
&+ylightning one can see that the cave ahead is but a large arch and that the
&+ypath continues through the center of the mountain.&n

&+yexplosions. To the north the same thunderclouds linger overhead, however the
&+yfierce wind is non-existant. A few strikes of lightning can be seen streaking
&+ythrough the sky and striking what appears to be a large stone structure in

&+y   Large boulders have been set to form a pair of crude stairs. The top of the
&+yboulders have been chiseled so that their surface is completely flat. Sheer
&+ywalls of stone border the edges of the stairs. The walls provide no crevices
&+yof hand holds in which one could attempt to scale should they be attaked. It
&+yis difficult to gauge what lies ahead in the distance for the stairs take
&+ynumerous twists and turns. At certain points the path goes flat before one

&+yErected centuries ago as the last safe haven of this warrior race, Stragthor
&+yhas now opened its gates to allow its warriors to roam the land of the humans
&+yin an effort to quelch the ravaging plague of Underdark denizens. As one
&+yenters the valley they realize that it resembles more a city carved into the
&+ystone mountain. Large stone buildings border wide rocky roads. The major
&+ybuildings appear to border the city and are actually carved into what remains
&+yof the mountainside. Dark thunderclouds hover overhead casting a deep shadow
&+yover the valley.&n

&+yhas been carved from the side of the mountain. Rising up on the outskirts of
&+ythe city are the peaks of the surrounding mountain. The peaks providing a
&+ynatural wall that protects its citizens from large scale attacks as well as
&+yensuring the city remains safely hidden. Large &+ggrassy &+yareas are barely visible

&+ygazes about the area they notice that construction has taken place and is
&+ystill on-going. Wooden platforms hang from the walls that border the road as

&+y   The wall that borders the southern edge of the road has been carved from
&+ythe side of the mountain range. The storm giants, wishing to be as close to
&+ythe torrential storms that hover overhead, simply excavated a large depression
&+yinto the side of the mountain ranges. The natural barrier serves as both a
&+ydefense mechanism, as the walls are of solid rock, and as camoflauge from
&+yintruding eyes. At first glance as one walks toward Stragthor they would
&+ysimply assume that they are travelling a mountainous path. A ledge can be seen
&+yabout thirty feet in the air extending from the southern wall and overhanging
&+ythe path. Guards moving about the ledge keep a watchful eye over the city and
&+yon any merchants moving just outside the city's boundary.&n

&+Lopened from the rear. Small wooden pegs have been driven into the stone walls
&+Lof the room. Hanging from the pegs are different types of game. The animal
&+Lmeats appear to have been organizes according to the type of animal that was
&+Lbutchered. Small rabbits, deer, hogs, and goat hang suspended by their hind
&+Llegs from the pegs. Along the floor a small amount of blood has collected in

&+LA Large Ravine Through the Valley&n~
&+y   This narrow ravine runs north and south through Stragthor. To the north
&+yone can barely see a grass covered plateau used for raising sheep and goats.
&+yTall walls of stone rise up and surround the ravine. The stone walls have been
&+yhollowed from the inside and now serve as caverns for the storm giants that
&+ystill remain in the city. Overhead a billowing &+mthu&+Lnde&+mrstorm &+ybrews. Streaks of
&+ylightning illuminate the sky with bright flashes followed by a loud explosion
&+yof thunder. The dark and gloomy sky overshadowing the natural beauty of the
&+ycity of giants.&n

&+LThe Edge of a Large Gathering Square&n~
&+y   The road turns north heading toward what appears to be a wide ravine that
&+ycuts across this mountain to the next. Along the edges of the road are small
&+youtcropping of stone buildings. To the east the road opens up into what
&+yappears to be a large square. From this distance one can see what appears to
&+ybe stone chairs spread out in a semi-circle surrounding a large platform.
&+yThick and dark &+Lth&+mun&+Lde&+mrc&+Llo&+mu&+Lds &+yswirl directly overhead. A fierce wind blows
&+yalong the road gathering force as the buildings funnel the wind along this
&+yparticuliar roadway. As one travels the wind pushes against their body making
&+yit feel as though an invisible barrier is halting their progress. Bolts of
&+ylightning arc across the dark and gloomy sky. The bolts strike the ground with
&+ytremendous force causing the stone beneath ones feet to shake violently before
&+ycoming to rest.&n

&+LA Narrow Side Street&n~
&+y   Much narrower than the other streets within the city, this small
&+ycobblestone road leads toward a small dwelling. The cave stands no more than
&+ytwenty feet tall and would appear to be too small for any adult storm giant to
&+yfit through its door. As where most of the other dwellings had a thick slab of
&+ygranite this dwelling has a small wooden door supported by four hinges
&+ycrafted of mithril. Two brass lanterns are mounted along the side of the door.
&+yThe flames burning within the lanterns cast a bright &+Yglow &+ythrough the area. A
&+ythin slab of rock extends about three feet from the top of the door providing
&+ya covering so that any who approach the dwelling can stay dry during the
&+ysuden thunderstorms that strike the valley.&n

&+LThe Main Foyer of the Shaledrieth Emissary~
&+y   Although the outside of the dwelling resembled nothing more than a small
&+ycave set within the storm giants city, this cave is richly adorned. The
&+yemmissary sent from &+YShaledrieth&N &+yhad no intention of living his days amongst the
&+ybrutal and often simple storm giants and instead brought every creature
&+ycomfort he could possibly carry through the treacherous pass. A fine
&+yoaken table sits against the side wall. Sitting atop the table is a small
&+yglass lantern. The etched glass intensifies the light radiating from the
&+ylanterns flame to fully illuminate the room. Along the floor lies a bright red
&+yrug trimmed in golden tassles. A set of double wooden doors lies at the far
&+yend of the foyer.&n

&+ygazes in that direction the stone buildings appear to be large obilisks
&+ycarved from the mountain itself. The structures rising from the rocky plateau
&+yto stand defiantly against the skyline. The rolling thunderclouds often
&+yrespond with arcs of lightning that race across the sky striking the very tips
&+yof the buildings. The road is comprised of smooth flat rocks that have been
&+yset into the hard stone at precise angles. A smooth black mortar fills the
&+yeges of the stone making it appear as though the path is actually a road.&n
&+yTo the east a large building is visible. The amount of traffic going in and

&+yarea as small boulders jut up from the roadway providing obstacles that

&+yand wagon through this pass. The roadway makes a light turn to the east

&+ylie just to the north overlooking a large grassy plateau that lies in the

&+ymansion are scattered with numerous boulders that jut from the ground like
&+ysmall fingers. The boulders designed as a guard should any of the great war
&+ymachines breach the main walls and attempt to lay seige to this section of
&+yStragthor. A heavy, &+Ldark &+ycloud, lingers just overhead. The fierce wind that
&+yblows through the valley can be screaming with a high pitched wail as it
&+yroams over and under the crevices along the road.&n

&+yone looks out from where they now stand, barely visible over the snow drifts
&+yis a clear view of Strgthor, valley of the snow giants. The valley appears to
&+yhave been excavated from the peaks of large mountains. Large stone bridges
&+ywith high arches can be seen linking one mountain peak to the next. A large
&+ystorm cloud swirls overhead. Ever so often a bright flash of &+Wlightning &+yflashes
&+yacross the sky followed quickly by a thunderous grumble.&n

&+yOverhead a billowing thunder cloud rumbles angrily sending bolts of lightning

&+Lhauled here to construct this dwelling. Open windows can be seen at varying
&+Llevels of the mansion. There are no glass windows nor coverings and instead
&+Lthe occupants have a clear view of the surrounding area. As one stands at this
&+Lvantage point and gazes at the path just traveled they notice that this peak
&+Lstands much higher than the surrounding area. A clear view of the valley is

&+Lthe high council. Evenly spaced along both sides of the room are tall granite
&+Lcolumns. Engraved in each of the columns are thick vines that start at the
&+Lstructures base and twist their way to the ceiling. Once the vines reach the
&+Lceiling they branch out, traveling the length of the room, to join the
&+Lstructures on the other side of the room. A large carpet of dyed deer fur runs
&+Lfar end of the room. Hanging from the walls in the spaces between the granite
&+Lcolumns are clay paintings. The scenes depicted are of fierce storm giant
&+Lwarriors engaged in battle on the sacred lands of Jotunheim. A majority of the
&+Ldead depicted on the ground are of drow and duergar leading one to believe
&+Lthat a recent invasion into those lands has stirred the storm giants of Duris
&+Linto joining the forces of Tharnadia.

&+yare sparse in this area as the animals instincts have them avoid going to
&+yclose to the cliffs edge. Overhead a large thundercloud looms casting a dark

&+LStanding At the Edge of a Rocky Cliff&n~
&+y   The grassy plateau ends at this point as the land suddenly drops off into
&+ya large cliff. As one stands near the edge an arctic wind blows as though
&+yattempting to push one over the side and into the rocky ravine below. Small
&+yshrubs sprout from the ground at the cliffs edge. The shrubs forming a
&+ymakeshift wall and if one were careless they could easily step over the
&+yvegetation and fall to their deaths. The animal tracks that litter the ground
&+yare sparse in this area as the animals instincts have them avoid going to
&+yclose to the cliffs edge. Overhead a large thundercloud looms casting a dark
&+yand gloomy shadow across the valley. Bolts of lightning strike down at
&+yrandom intervals striking some object within the main section of the valley.&n

&+LOverlooking a Cliff&n~
&+y   As one approaches the edge of the cliff they must overstep small shrubs

&+ythe tough wool of the grazing sheep. The thorn bushes serving as a natural

&+ythat a &+Ws&+wi&+Wl&+wv&+We&+wr&+Wy m&+wi&+Ws&+wt &+yabout a hundred feet down obscures vision to the valley

&+ycould be used for farming. Hooved imprints into the soft soil indicate that
&+yinstead of cultivating the land the storm giants use it as a grazing field
&+yfor their sheep and goats. Small shrubs and other &+gvegetation &+yrise from the
&+yrich soil. The cold air seems to do little to thwart the growth of vegetation
&+yin the area and strangely enough the field thrives with lush foliage.

&+yone peers about it is an almost surreal vision. Here lies a fertile land
&+ycovered with thick grass and trees amidst the snow covered peaks in the valley
&+yof Stragthor. Small outcropping of trees and brush litter the landscape, their
&+yfull blooms adding a slight color of brown to the otherwise green landscape. A
&+yfierce wind howls overhead, cast as a thundering cloud swirls about the
&+yvalley. Along the ground are tracks left by heavy animals. The hooved marks

&+yinto the air. The smooth &+Lgranite &+ysurface appears to have been carved from the

&+yacademy of some sort. A large plaque mounted onto the wall bares the symbol of

&+rEntranceway to the Mercenary Guild&n~
&+y   This wide room takes an almost circular shape in appearance. Those storm
&+ygiants training as mercenaries were more agile and swift than those trained
&+yas warriors. Having realized the special abilities of a few of their race, the
&+ygrand council funded the development of the &+Lmercenary &+yguild. As new recruits
&+yare selected to attend one of the two guilds, the swifter are sent to learn
&+ythe trade of "warrior for hire". Often indebted for years, those storm giants
&+ythat earn their money freelance pay a yearly due to the high council. The walls
&+yof the room appear to have been recently carved. Long nicks in the stone from
&+ywhere the chisels struck are still visible. Hammered hastily into the walls
&+yare metal brackets. Long wooden torches, dipped in tar, burn within the
&+ybrackets.&n

&+yLined along both sides of the wall are statues of warriors clad in battle
&+yarmor. The armor consisting mainly of patched furs. Primarily wielding great
&+ystone &+Lclubs&+y, only a few giants hold massive two-handed swords in both their
&+yhands. The battles the statues fought are easily identifiable for their slain

&+yoverhead is a small ball of &+Mf&+ma&+Me&+mr&+Mi&+me &+Mf&+mi&+Mr&+me&+y. The ball casting an array of

&+ywith a dark haze. The majority of smoke rises to the ceiling. As one peers up
&+yto watch the smokes flow they notice that there is no cavern ceiling, instead
&+yone has a clear view of a thick and thunderous stormcloud. The black haze that
&+ylingers about the cavern, a result of the burning &+gt&+Lre&+ges &+yand branches, gathers
&+yabout ones throat and chest making talking difficult and spell casting
&+yimpossible. The strange feeling a result of ancient herbs mixed into the fire

&+yA single slab of granite rests atop two thick &+Lobilisks&+y. The granite serving as

&+Lfrom the mountainside that the excavaters simply chiseled around the large
&+Lstone slab. Hanging from rocky pegs behind the counter are pieces of animal
&+Lhide armor and a few crude weapons. The shop obviously not catering to the
&+Lfiner weapons, but stocking the basic equipment for those who finish their
&+Ltraining here at the academy. Snaking like thin cracks along the wall are
&+Lveins of &+Cm&+ci&+Ct&+ch&+Cr&+ci&+Cl&+L. The strange metal embued with underdark radiation emits a
&+Lsoft, eerie glow. The light, although dim, casts enough light by which to see.&n

&+ycarved stone are set in numerous circles along the ground. Although the
&+yrest of the academy is carved from stone, and having a rocky floor, the
&+yground within this chamber is of a soft sand. Peering out over the main
&+ychamber one notices large footprints set into the sand. The sand having been
&+ybrought into the chamber to allow the veteran &+Bwarriors &+yto demonstrate the
&+ycorrect positioning of ones feet as they engage in melee combat. Set high into
&+ythe far wall is a large stone balcony. The senior trainer often standing to
&+ywatch as the new recruits spar with each other. Along the ground and mixed
&+ywith the sand are small splotches of a reddish-brown liquid. One quickly
&+yrealizes that although only training, that the fierce warriors often become
&+yenraged and that &+Wd&+we&+Wa&+wt&+Wh &+yis no stranger to these grounds.&n

&+yportion of the city. The backs of tall stone structures border both sides of
&+ythe road. If it were not for the fact that one is walking through a a city
&+yexcavated from the peak of a mountain, it would sem as though they now stand
&+yamidst a dark alleyway in some grand city. Overhead a dark and thunderous
&+ycloud lingers casting a deep shadow over the city. Streaks of lightning

&+y   Having settled here centuries ago, the storm giants left Jotunheim to be in
&+yseclusion. Excavating the peaks of a small mountain range the founded the
&+yvalley of Stragthor. Nestled safely within a tall wall of mountains the valley
&+yprovides everything they need to survive the lands of duris. The snow covered
&+ypeaks at the cities border preventing most travelers from reaching the
&+yinterior of the city. Overhead a large thundercloud casts a deep shadow over
&+ythe valley. Bolts of lightning reign down in a thunderous roar. The loud
&+yexplosion as the lightning strikes stone echoes through the valley.&n

&+ythere are no visible cracks or crevices and instead their surface is as smooth
&+yas glass. The rocks that lie about the ravine are not jagged, but rather
&+yperfectly round and one quickly realizes that flowing water rushing through
&+ythe ravine has smoothed all the rocks along its borders. The thunderous
&+ycloud overhead looking as though it will unleash a fury of rain which could
&+yprove deadly for anyone standing in the ravine as the water begins to flow.&n

&+yfor just one slip would send them tumbling to their deaths. To make travel
&+yworse, a fierce wind blows along the ravine.  The wind gathering force as it
&+ytravels along the mountain side. As it swirls in and through the small
&+ycrevices within the rock, the wind gains a high pitched screeching sound. The
&+ysound echoing through the area as though a banshee's wail.&n

&+yof the mountain. It is difficult for one to tell exactly how far the drop is
&+ybecuase a silvery &+Wm&+wi&+Ws&+wt &+yhovers about fifty feet down obscurring ones vision. A
&+yset of stones, forming crude stairs, allow for some form of footing for those
&+ybrave enough to venture down into the mists.&n

&+yis standing still on the ledge, a powerful wind blows from the mountain said
&+yattempting to push one over the edge. Small pebbles and round stones on the
&+yground make footing difficult as at any time, one false step will send one
&+yscreaming over the ledge. In between the screeching wail of the wind, the
&+yfaint sound of &+Bw&+Cav&+Bes &+ycrashing against rocks echoes from within the mist.&n

&+ydissipate the silvery mists and instead only makes traveling the ravine even
&+ymore dangerous. The ravine angles sharply to an almost straight drop off
&+yfrom the side of the mountain. Small rocky pegs extend from the mountain
&+yproviding a secure foot hold for which one can move. In the distance one can
&+yhear the sound of waves striking &+Lrocks&+y.&n

&+yis a thick cloud of silver vapor. The cloud so thick that one would believe
&+ythey could simply reach up and grasp the &+wcloud &+ylooking substance in their
&+yhands. If one were to walk back down the ravine they would approach a large
&+yocean. The waves striking the rocks at the base of the ravine echoing along
&+ythe path. If one were to continue up into the mist, a uneasy feeling
&+yovercomes one as the mist appears to be protecting whatever lies just
&+ybeyond the veil of silver.&n

&+yrocks and large boulders out into the &+Co&+Bcea&+Cn &+ythat borders the northern section
&+yof the land. Gazing up along the path the ravine takes, one notices that it
&+ysnakes its way up the mountain until disappearing into a silvery mist. The
&+ymist lingers, unmoving, a few hundred feet up the ravines path. To the north
&+ythe sound of waves breaking on large rocks echoes thrugh the area. The
&+ywind carrying a cool mist created from the striking waves.&n

&+yMounted on all four walls are bronze lanterns. A small flame burns in each of

&+MA Long Narrow Hallway&n~
&+y   Weaving its way through the interior of the palace, this long hallway
&+yappears to open up into a large chamber just to the east. Mounted along the
&+ywalls of the hall are fine oil paintings that one would expect to see in the
&+ymansions of Tharnadia. In the space between the paintings are large reed
&+ytorches. The torches, having been dipped in a flammable liquid, burn with an
&+yintense &+Yf&+Rla&+Yme&+y. A thin mithril sheet around the edge of the torches shields
&+ythe paintins from the intense heat of the flames. The light radiating from the
&+ytorches is enough to fully illuminate the room.&n

&+LA Ledge Overlooking the &+BO&+Cc&+Be&+Ca&+Bn&n~
&+y   This wide rocky ledge stands outstretched a few feet above a raging ocean.
&+yAs one peers over the ledge they notice large grey rocks protruding from the
&+ywhite foamy water. As each wave strikes the rocks, a fine &+Wm&+wi&+Ws&+wt &+yis sprayed
&+yover the ledge coating the area in moisture. A light green algae thrives in
&+ybetween the rocks that com prise the ledge. The &+galgae &+yfeeding off the constant
&+ymoisture cast about the area. A flock of seagulls are barely visible in the
&+ydistance. The constant chatter filling the air until the next wave comes
&+ycrashing in. A small rocky slope, with chisled steps, leads down to the water
&+ybelow. The stairs, having been carved by someone other than the storm giants,
&+yprovides easy access to any who should attempt to dock a ship at this point.&n

&+LOn Stairs of Chiseled &+yRock&n~
&+y   A small set of stairs have been chisled into the rocky wall. The stairs
&+yleading to the ocean below. If one travels up the stairs they appear to lead
&+ytoward a cliff that sits just below a jagged mountain range. As one peers up
&+ythe stairs and unto the mountains they notice a dark storm cloud hovering
&+yabout midway up along the peeks. The stormcloud obscurring vision of what lies
&+ytoward the top of the mountain range. Large jagged rocks protrude from the
&+yocean like rocky spikes. As each wave comes crashing against the natural rocks
&+ya &+Ws&+wi&+Wl&+wv&+We&+wr&+Wy &+ymist is sprayed against any standing on the stairs.&n

&+BStanding at the Oc&+Cean&+Bs Edge&n~
&+y   The rocky stairs chisled into the side of a cliff lie just to the south. As
&+ythe stairs spiral down, they fan out disappearing to the north into the ocean.
&+yAs one walks along the stairs, the rocky bottom stands submerged at least a
&+yfoot beneath the water. As one peers down into the water they notice that the
&+yrocks on which one now stands serve as a makeshift pier. If one were to walk
&+yoff the edge of the stairs they would fall deep into the oceans depth. The
&+ymakeshift pier allowing a small ship to pull up and be offloaded without the
&+yneed to dispatch a much smaller scourge or raft. Small barnacles lie crushed
&+yalong the surface of the pier. The crushed shells indicating that the area
&+ywas recently walked upon as a ships goods were offloaded.&n

&+MThe Edge of Stragthors Market&n~
&+y   This large area was carved from the very edge of a mountain peak and now
&+yresembles more of a vast canyon. Having opened their gates to the other good
&+yraces of Duris, the area was quickly overrun with merchants and tradesmen
&+yseeking new and strange goods created by the storm giants. The area has
&+yquickly grown to be one of the most popular of bazzars. Large tents cover wide
&+ytables used by the merchants to hawk their wares. The tables are erected in no
&+yparticular order and are aligned at odd angles creating obstacles that one
&+ymust navigate to get from one merchant to the other. The flaps of the brightly
&+ycolored tents hang directly overhead creating a shelter to protect one from
&+yrain and wind.&n

&+yabout the floor they notice large footprints set within the sand. Large grey
&+ystones jut from the floor. Small shields and wooden swords are attached to the
&+ystones and appear to provide a stationary target for practicing swordplay. A
&+ythick canvas sack stuffed with &+Ystraw &+ysits toward the rear of each of the
&+ystones. The small circular target areas painted on the sacks indicate the
&+yvital areas in which to place a deadly backstab.&n

&+MA Large Oval Library&n~
&+y   Stacked atop large stone shelves lining the walls are volumes upon volumes
&+yof books. The bindings all pushed firmly against the stone walls. A few of
&+ythe books hang out beyond the edge of the shelves. The books appearing as
&+ythough they could fall from their perch at any minute. As one gazes about the
&+yroom they are struck with awe at the history that must be contained within
&+ythis library. During the gaze ones eyes settle on a large red book with gold
&+yrunes etched into its binding. The runes glowing with a strange aura. As one
&+yhappens to look closer they notice that a metal spring is attached to the edge
&+yof the book. Mounted on the stone edges between the shelves are large brass
&+ylanterns. The fire within casting a bright glow about the room.&n

&+MA Long and Narrow Hallway&n~
&+y   The dark stone that comprises the wall of this hallway has been chiseled
&+yflat giving it the appearance of slate. The flat panels shine as though they
&+yare coated with oil. Spaced at random intervals along the wall are thick metal
&+ybrackets. Tall torches of twisted wood sit within the brackets. Their tips
&+ydipped in a dark oil causing the flame to burn with a bright intensity. The
&+yyellow flame flickering and licking at the walls but casting a bright light
&+yabout the area. The light casts eerie shadows along the paintings that line
&+ythe wall. As one gazes down to the end of the hall they notice a large
&+ystone door.&n

&+MWithin an &+mElegant &+MBedroom&n~
&+y   A large wooden bed sits in the middle of the room. The vibrantly colored
&+ysheets atop the bed appear as though they are silk. A thin layer of laced
&+yfabric is sewn along the edge of the sheets. The headboard is comprised of a
&+ylarge mirror inlaid with shiny silver along its edges. Small vines and flowers
&+yare engraved into the silver giving it an upscale appearance. Sitting to the
&+yside of the bed is a large oak drawer. Small bottles of herbs and spice sit
&+yatop the drawer, used by the rooms occupants in their quest to add fragrance
&+yto their body odor. A thick red rug, oval in shape, sits neatly beneath the
&+ybed. The golden tassles sewn around the rugs edge neatly outlayed onto the
&+yfloor.&n

&+YThe Throne Room of &+CKing St&+cr&+Ca&+ca&+Cg&n~
&+Y   As one enters the throne room of King Straag they are quickly strucken with
&+Yawe at the wondrous elegance created by the storm giants. A tall throne of gold
&+Ystands inthevery center of the room. The walls, a dark granite stone with
&+Ythick &+Cm&+ci&+Ct&+ch&+Cr&+ci&+Cl &+Yveins, rise up forming a domed cathedral. As one peers up at the
&+Yvery center of the ceiling, at the point in which it forms the dome, they
&+Ynotice that the ceiling is made of glass. Through the glass one sees the very
&+Ycenter of a raging thunderstorm. Gazing back down the the golden throne, one
&+Ynotices that the throne sits atop four steps. The marbled floor etched with
&+Yintricate runes so that the subjects of Stragthor, no matter their height,
&+Ywill always be beneath King Straag.&n

&+LA Large &+BSea &+LCave&n~
&+y   The constant shifting of the tides has worn a hole into the side of the
&+yrocky cliffs. Now covered with a slab of granite that blocks visible
&+ypassage into the cave, the large opening would appear to allow an Ogre
&+yto enter standing fully upright. Large spear shaped rocks jut from the ground
&+ylike giant teeth. The rushing sea water covering the bottom half of the
&+ycaverns floor in a secession of flowing water that ripples coursely along the
&+yground. As one peers about the cavern they get the overwhelming impression of
&+yentering the mouth of a large beast.&n

&+BThe Edge of a Shallow Lagoon&n~
&+y   A large mound of sand to the north prevents the rushing sea water from
&+yentering this section of the beach. The sand driven by a recent storm has
&+ytrapped a large amount of water forming a small lagoon. Visible beneath the
&+yclear blue water are small schools of fish. The fish, of varying sizes and
&+ycolors, dart back and forth in a mass of scale and fins. Footprints still
&+yvisible in the soft golden stand give indication that the lagoon supplies an
&+yeasy meal for any who should be camping in the area for an extended time.&n

&+yBarely visible beyond the crest of the sand lies a vast ocean. To the south
&+yand west the lagoon is bordered by a large mountain range. The sand that has
&+ytrapped the sea water in this area was left by a recent storm. As one looks
&+yabout the ground they notice large footprints in the sand. The footprints as
&+ywide as a storm giants foot, but also much smaller ones indicating that some
&+yof the humanoid races also visit this area.&n

&+yenough room by which a raiding party could base their camp. Inset into the
&+ycool stone walls are large bronze brackets. The brackets holding flaming
&+ytorches that cast a bright light throughout the area. The burning weeds
&+ysizzle softly as a snakes hiss each time thier flames lick the cool and moist
&+ycavern wall. Large &+Lrocks &+yjust from the water that covers the cavern floor.
&+yThe rocks providing both a table for planning and in some instances a dry bed

&+yproviding perches on which the rams and goats raised by the storm giants
&+ystand atop claiming their individual territories. Small piles of dung litter
&+ythe ground. One has to be careful as they walk for the soft excrement sticks
&+yto ones boot like fresh mud.&

&+g   The grassy plateau ends at this point as the land suddenly drops off into
&+ga large cliff. As one stands near the edge an arctic wind blows as though
&+gattempting to push one over the side and into the rocky ravine below. Small
&+gshrubs sprout from the ground at the cliffs edge. The shrubs forming a
&+gmakeshift wall and if one were careless they could easily step over the
&+gvegetation and fall to their deaths. The animal tracks that litter the ground
&+gare sparse in this area as the animals instincts have them avoid going to
&+gclose to the cliffs edge. Overhead a large thundercloud looms casting a dark
&+gand gloomy shadow across the valley. Bolts of lightning strike down at
&+grandom intervals striking some object within the main section of the valley.&n
