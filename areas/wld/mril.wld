&+yBurial Ground Entrance&n~
&+L   The entrance to the graveyard has a large gate that spans across the path.
&+LIt is engulfed in spider webs and rust from the passing years.  The gate has
&+La small wooden sign with the words "Keep Out" posted on it.  The entrance is
&+La dirt path that leads into an old graveyard.  This path has not been traveled
&+Lfor centuries.  There is a lot of bushes laying on the path which makes it
&+Lsomewhat hard to see the trail ahead.  Also there is a strange looking skull
&+Lhanging on the side of the gate.&n

&+L   This is the center of the graveyard.  To the east is the entrance, west
&+Lare two separated grave sites, north is the DEAD END, and south is a forest
&+Lgrove.  This intersection was well traveled years ago and still today there
&+Lis not much grass on the path. Surprisingly there are no tombs around the
&+Lintersection.  This must have been a gathering place for people who had a
&+Lfamily member die.  Also the certain gloominess that engulfs the graveyard
&+Lseems to be missing in this room.&n

&+yInside a Huge Tree&n~
   There are strange engraved symbols on the walls.  Its seem to be some sort
of ancient language.  The inside of the tree as been burned out and chiseled
to a smooth finish.  There is one large root that limits your movement in
here.  The entrance into the tree is a transparent wall.  From the outside
the tree looks normal, but from the inside there doesn't seem to be anything
there.

   This underground shelter is a small confined area.  The shelter is made
in-between the giant roots of the tree.  The floor is all dirt, the walls

&+BRiverside Road&n~
&+B   This is a road next to a small river.  It is a twelve foot wide dirt road.
&+BThe river next to the road has a swift current and big jagged rocks that
&+Bcreate its big rapids.  There are groups of fisherman on the side of the road
&+Bfishing for samon.  On the opposite side of the river is the city of Miaeril.
&+BThe sound of the nearby river is very relaxing.&n
