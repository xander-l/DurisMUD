&+LDeep &+bBelow the Waters &+LSurface&n~
&+b   This far under the waters surface, sun light is just a glimmer and
&+bpressure is at an all time high.  Enemies have the advantage under such
&+bconditions.  Suddenly ones bravery is tested as the path continues into
&+ba cramped water cavern.  Proceed into the &+Ldarkness&+b or rise for &+Wair&+b.&n

&+m   Erosion has provided a serpent with this private opening.  Cramped
&+myet adequate the lair has been tucked away from observers for far too
&+mlong.  A mystical light hovers at the cavern core, exposing lost
&+mtreasures and forgotten relics.&n

&+LSmo&+wkey Back&+ywoods&n~
&+y   Blocked from sight, this backwoods hideout is a calm retreat from
&+ythe busy docks.  Tucked between the rocky shores and lake shallows is
&+ythis firm landing.  Although shaded by day, there is an opening for
&+ystar gazing the night sky.  The central firepit placed here is still
&+ysmoldering.  Being here seems to help your personal &+wregeneration&+y.&n
