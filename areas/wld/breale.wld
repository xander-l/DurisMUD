lifeless. It looks as though they have been there for a few days. Flies are
buzzing around several of them. Some of these women have enough strength to
wave the flies off even with the limited mobility they have. In the very center
of all of these pillories there is a very tall stake. Underneath it are burnt,
charred ashes of a fire that had gone out. Burnt ends of rope hang off of the
stake. The prior occupant of the wooden stake had probably been relieved of the
burdens of the rope as soon as the fires consumed her. To the north is the
Market Square. To the south is the Town Well.

&+WSecret Passage~
   This passage is so narrow, one has to crawl through it. There is a slight
draft coming from the western tunnel. The passage allows access to both the
east and the south. The eastern passage looks more visible, as there are lights
in that direction. To the west is a door.

&+BPassage of Clarity~
   The tunnel widens into this room. In the center of the room is a bronze
table with a white table cloth. On top of the table is a gold wand. However,
the wand cannot be removed-- something is preventing it from movement of any
sort. On the eastern wall is a message with a &+W"one"&N printed over it. On
the western wall is a message with a &+W"two"&N printed over it.

&+BPassage of Clarity~
   In the center of a room, a straw broom hovers over the ground. Any attempts
to grab it, and it swiftly moves in one direction out of reach. The broom seems
to have a life its own. On the east side of the wall is a message with a number
&+W"three"&N over it. The west side has a message with a &+W"four"&N over it.

   A large, black hat is twirling in the center of the room. The hat is pointed
and has designs of yellow moons and white stars all over it. Any attempts to
touch the hat results in an electric shock. On the east side of the wall a
number is written over some scribblings: &+W"five"&N. On the west side, the
number &+W"six"&N.

   This passage is so narrow, one has to crawl through it. There is a slight
draft coming from the western tunnel. The passage allows access to the west. A
door to the east looks like it blocks a room with lights in it. One can see the
light shining underneath it. The passage to the south also looks lit.

&+YSpices 'n Things~
   The room seems lit, but there are no torches to be seen. An old hag in rags
sits behind the counter picking her teeth with some straw. Her hat is pointed,
and she some very grotesque moles and warts on her face and hands. She squints
her eyes as though she is in deep thought and contemplation. In the corner of
the room is a broom and several books. Behind the counter, a giant apparatus
made of glass is pumping and bubbling some concoction. Different colored
liquids are traveling from one container to another.

&+WDark Tunnel~
   This tunnel has no lighting whatsoever. It is cold. The draft seems to
funnel through here making a type of whistling sound. The tunnel is very narrow
from the feel of it, and requires very careful stepping to avoid tripping or
bumping into the wall. There is a hole about the size of a fist in the south
wall. This is the source of the draft. The hole must be a shaft up to ground
level used to keep these tunnels full of air.

&+RWitch Central~
   This lit cavern is triangular in shape. A large cross hangs upside down
from the ceiling. On the center floor is a drawing of a triangle with three
twinkling stars at each end. Although it is only a drawing, the stars are
glowing. Sitting on this drawing is a stone base with fire coming from it.
A gigantic black cauldron is hung over the fire, bubbling. Doors lead north,
south, east, and west from here.

magic. A broom sits in the corner. A small cauldron bubbles in the corner over
a fire. A pointed hat lies on the table next to an open book. Several symbols

of spices sit on a shelf.

   The room is entirely bathed in red lights. The source of the lights cannot

interlinked, forming a star. There is a large hole in the center of the room--
but it cannot be entered because of the immense heat rising out of it.

   There is a clothes rack on the west side of the room; on it, hangs a
beautiful black silk robe. When trying to get the robe, the hand passes through
it, as though the robe did not exist. A large painting of a white-bearded man
hangs on the wall. His eyes show that he is very angry. They seem to follow
anyone within the room. Black curtains adorn the north and south walls.
