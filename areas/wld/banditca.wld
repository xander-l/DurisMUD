&+rOutside a Huge Camp&+w~
    While the surrounding landscape is rather plain, to the north lies a huge
camp. Roofs of tents and wooden structures can be seen rising above the
tall wooden wall that surrounds that camp. The sound of yelling
can be heard within the camp, punctuated by the occasional scream of pain.
This camp could be a gypsy camp although there is an equally
high chance that it is a home to bandits and slave traders. Smoke
can be seen rising from the center of the camp, presumably from a
massive bonfire burning within.

&+YA Path Near the Camp's Main Entrance&+w~
    This dusty trail leads closer to a large gate that leads into the camp.
The noise of the many people inside can be heard here which makes it sound
like it's extremely crowded inside. Although the many tents give the
appearance that this camp is temporary, the massive wall built around the
camp gives a clue that this place is a permanent settlement. Guard towers
built with strategically placed arrow slits and defenses are noticeable in
the distance which gives the idea that this is a camp for warlike nomads
or bandits.

surrounding the camp consists of massive logs making entrance impossible.
Vicious looking spikes can be seen at the top which makes the idea of
scaling impossible. Many wagon tracks and hoof prints can be found on the
ground which shows this camp faces heavy traffic through the front gate.
The front gate itself can be found a short distance to the east. Westwards
leads to a small untraveled trail around the camp.

    Magically lit torches line the walls of this dirty tunnel. This tunnel
appears to have been made as an escape route for the bandits if they
needed to leave the camp fast and secretly in an emergency. It seems to
have been constructed by a superior engineer and looks to be very stable
with little chance of collapsing. The ground and walls are very dry and
dusty and this place appears to be kept at least partially maintained. No
doubt this tunnel would not only help the bandits escape the camp but
prisoners unfortunate enough to have been captured by the bandits could
escape through here. Upwards is a trapdoor which leads out of here.

Magically lit torches line the wall every several feet making it possible
for a human to move through here at any time of day. The wall itself is
composed of very tall logs with sharpened spikes at the top making attempts
to scale it impossible. A catwalk is directly above here which gives the
guards a chance to drop stuff on those who walk here. There are not many
footprints on the ground and it is rather quiet here which gives the idea
that this place is not frequently traveled. Numerous tents can be seen
towards the center of the camp and loud noises can be heard from an open
area in the center. There is a ladder here which leads to the catwalk
above which is about seven metres off the ground.

several windows give view to the outside. There is a fire pit in the center

    While this building the same size of the other guards barracks, it
is obviously made for only one very important person. There is a bed
in the southeast corner and a writing desk opposite of it. The inside
of this place appears to be the most well kept place of the entire camp.
Room for a fire is in the northwestern side of the building with a chimney
above it that provides ventilation. Luxurious looking carpets line the
floor making this room look fit for a Tharnadian duke. Fancy tapestries
can be found on the wall each depicting symbols of ancient and very
evil gods.

    While this building the same size of the other guards barracks, it
is obviously made for only one very important person. There is a bed
in the southeast corner and a writing desk opposite of it. The inside
of this place appears to be the most well kept place of the entire camp.
Room for a fire is in the northwestern side of the building with a chimney
above it that provides ventilation. Luxurious looking carpets line the
floor making this room look fit for a Tharnadian duke. Fancy tapestries
can be found on the wall each depicting symbols of ancient and very
evil gods.

&+LA Path Leading to the Center of a Bandit Camp&+w~
    This narrow path leads between the center of the bandit camp, and to
the road alongside the wall of the camp. Westwards is a door which leads
into a very sturdy looking and fancy building. To the east a giant cage
can be seen which is where the slaves are kept until they are sold or
put to work. Southwards leads to an area directly north of the actual
auction while north leads back to the road along the wall.

&+rInside a Slave Pen&+w~
    The condition of this pen is absolutely wretched. One could say that
the condition of the cattle pen is luxurious compared to this place.
Slaves unfortunate enough to be kept here are forced to live in their own
filth. Numerous rats can be heard scurrying across the floor and
occasionally huge bugs can be seen running across the pen. The pen is
very small too and the slaves are forced to live with little room to
lie down. Diseased blood and other bodily fluids can be seen on the ground
further showing how disgusting a place this is. There is a view of the
northern wall of the camp to the north.

    This building is as plain as buildings get and appears to have been hastily
set up. The building is square with hammocks lining the walls. Space for a
fire pit has been set aside in the center of the building and there is a small
hole at the ceiling, functioning as a crude chimney. There are no windows
and the only exit is a beat up wooden door to the south. It is quite dirty
inside with broken bottles of ale and other debris strewn about. This structure
probably could house twenty bandits.

    This path leads right along the interior wall of the bandit camp.
Magically lit torches line the wall every several feet making it possible
for a human to move through here at any time of day. The wall itself is
composed of very tall logs with sharpened spikes at the top making attempts
to scale it impossible. A catwalk is directly above here which gives the
guards a chance to drop stuff on those who walk here. There are not many
footprints on the ground and it is rather quiet here which gives the idea
that this place is not frequently traveled. Numerous tents can be seen
towards the center of the camp and loud noises can be heard from an open
area in the center. It can be seen that the northern path bends abruptly
to the west.

    These barracks are much more comfortable than the ones used by the
rest of the camp. Instead of hammocks, comfortable beds line the wall and
several windows give view to the outside. There is a fire pit in the center
of the room and a chimney right permitting proper ventilation. There is only
one exit to the south which leads right into the center of the camp. These

gathered. Because this place is so open it would be a bad place to be caught

that is a giant platform which the auctioneer stands on to sell items
or slaves. Exits lead in all directions and numerous tents can be found
on all sides also. Several wooden structures can be seen in the distance
as can a slave pen to the northeast and a cattle pen to the south. This
place makes a perfect gathering place whether it be to prepare for a raid,
to sell slaves, or to watch an execution of a prisoner.

&+LA Path Leading to the Center of the Bandit Camp&+w~
    This narrow path leads between the center of the bandit camp, and to
the road alongside the wall of the camp. To the north is a small tent
while southwards is the northern wall of a wooden structure. Great shouts
can be heard to the east while the road on the west seems much quieter and
less traveled. A giant platform can be faintly seen in the distance along
with a great smoky bonfire.

    This path leads right along the interior wall of the bandit camp.
Magically lit torches line the wall every several feet making it possible
for a human to move through here at any time of day. The wall itself is
composed of very tall logs with sharpened spikes at the top making attempts
to scale it impossible. A catwalk is directly above here which gives the
guards a chance to drop stuff on those who walk here. There are not many
footprints on the ground and it is rather quiet here which gives the idea
that this place is not frequently traveled. Numerous tents can be seen
towards the center of the camp and loud noises can be heard from an open
area in the center. To the west is a path which leads straight into the
center of the camp.

   This tent is very small and could hold five people at the most. The tent
walls are made from leather and it appears to be quite stable. These tents
are used as living quarters for visitors to the camp and contain a bedroll
and room for a small fire. Although plain in most senses, it appears to be
quite cozy compared to the harsh outside of the bandit camp.

set up. The building is square with hammocks lining the walls. Space for a
fire pit has been set aside in the center of the building and there is a small
hole at the ceiling, functioning as a crude chimney. There are no windows
and the only exit is a beat up wooden door to the north. It is quite dirty
inside with broken bottles of ale and other debris strewn about. This structure

    This path is quite wide and could allow passage for horse drawn carts
and other large vehicles. Those types of vehicles appear to take full
advantage of this road as many tracks are evident on the ground. The north
leads near the center of the camp where a wooden platform can be faintly
seen. Southwards leads out of this camp and to the entrance to the cattle
pen where live cattle is kept for food.

&+yThe Eastern Side of a Wooden Structure&+w~
    This building is as plain as buildings get and appears to have been hastily
set up. The building is square with hammocks lining the walls. Space for a
fire pit has been set aside in the center of the building and there is a small
hole at the ceiling, functioning as a crude chimney. There are no windows
and the only exit is a beat up wooden door to the north. It is quite dirty
inside with broken bottles of ale and other debris strewn about. This structure
probably could house twenty bandits.

&+yAlong the Wall of a Bandit Camp&+w~
    This path leads right along the interior wall of the bandit camp.
Magically lit torches line the wall every several feet making it possible
for a human to move through here at any time of day. The wall itself is
composed of very tall logs with sharpened spikes at the top making attempts
to scale it impossible. A catwalk is directly above here which gives the
guards a chance to drop stuff on those who walk here. There are not many
footprints on the ground and it is rather quiet here which gives the idea
that this place is not frequently traveled. Numerous tents can be seen
towards the center of the camp and loud noises can be heard from an open
area in the center.

    This building is as plain as buildings get and appears to have been hastily

&+gInside a Cattle Pen&+w~
    This small fenced off area is used by the bandits to store live cattle
to keep as food. It is extremely dirty and piles of manure can be found
all over the place. While small this pen is still capable of holding
enough cattle to feed the majority of the bandits in the camp. To the north
one can see the center of the camp where slave auctions are often held.
Southwards directly faces the southern wall of the camp.

&+rA Heavily Travelled Road to the Center of the Camp&+w~
    This path is quite wide and could allow passage for horse drawn carts
and other large vehicles. Those types of vehicles appear to take full
advantage of this road as many tracks are evident on the ground. The north
leads near the center of the camp where a wooden platform can be faintly
seen. Southwards leads out of this camp near the southern wall of it while
to the west is a gate which leads into a small cattle pen where live cattle
is kept for food.

&+rInside the Entrance to a Bandit Camp&+w~
    This area is right inside the gate to the bandit camp. Numerous tents
can be seen inside and smoke from a huge bonfire can be seen towards the
center of the camp. This place appears well traveled as wagon wheel
tracks, hoof prints, and human foot prints can be seen all over the
place. The ground is very firm which makes it an excellent place for
travelling. Directly above is a catwalk with slits at the bottom which
enable the guards to throw stuff at people below. Southwards leads to
a massive gate which leads out of the camp back into the plains. Because
of all the wood used to build this fort an out of control fire would
definitely destroy the entire camp.

has plenty of room for bandits to duck from arrows and throw projectiles
down on enemies on the other side of the wall. The catwalk itself is made
from wood with metal reinforcements which make for a very stable platform.
It continues east and west for several meters and is not very long. Down
