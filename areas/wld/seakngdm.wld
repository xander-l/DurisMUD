&+LA Landing Before a &+WGate&N~
   Just below the &+bElemental Plane of Water&N, this eerie and mysterious
landing has been formed just under a small shaft.  From this point, a very
heavily guarded entrance into the &+WSea Kingdom&N lies to the southeast.
The surroundings are composed of very dark waters, all drifing slowly with-
out any motion.  A small landing rests here, before a set of massive
nightstone gates.

&+bA &+rM&+bo&+Rs&+Ba&+ri&+bc &+cViewing Chamber&N~
   &+bThis large circular chamber comes to a dome at the top.  Intricate
&+bpictures cover the inner dome depicting heavy rains, flooded valleys,
&+band monstrous waves, each conjured by a bearded sea God.  Each large
&+bmural is sectioned off by the finest of &+ccr&+Cyst&+cal &+bcorals, grown
&+bperfectly and naturally into position.

   &+LLooking down, towards the base of the trident statue&+L, you notice
&+Lthat it been formed over some loose-looking rubble.  Chanting can also
&+Lbe heard from below in some sort of strange uncomprehendable tongue,
&+Lmost likely some sort of &+Wpraying to the statue&+L.

A &+WDome&+b of &+rC&+bo&+rr&+ba&+rl&N~
   &+gSea coral has grown in a large dome-like shape, entrapping any
&+glife within it.  The coral itself is very beautiful, but completely
&+gindestructable.  It has grown to the point where in every direction,
&+gexcept for just below, is unaccessable.  Perhaps, the will that has
&+gforced the coral to grow in such an unpredictable pattern has made
&+git this way in order to trap trespassers.

&+Larea.  It appears that this one small portion of the lake is much more
&+Lcomfortable then the rest, due mainly to the breathable air, and the

&NAn &+cIll&+Cusi&+cona&+Lry Ramp &NTo a &+bGhost Ship&N~
   A large &+Linvisible&N bridge reaches out north to the starboard side of
a large ghost ship.  Some sort of dark magic has kept this ship alive deep
within the darkest part of the sea kingdom.  The ship rests without motion,
and is constantly &+Wphasing&N in and out of existence.  There are no boards
or planks or anything that make up the structure of the ship, only a hazy
&+Lgray&N outline.

&+LThe Ultranos, Starboard Side~
   &+LThis portion of the Ultranos is on the starboard side.  This mysterious
&+Lghost ship bares no identifying marks of any kind, and is merely a faint
&+Lgray and misty outline of a once-prosperous ship.  Looking over the side
&+Lof the ship, the Shadow Lake is totally invisible.  The Ultranos is not
&+Lmoving or shifting in the currents at all, and rather, is sitting here
&+Lin a frozen state.

   &+LThis is the center of the ghost ship, the Ultranos.  There are no
&+Lnavigation controls or anything on this misty and hazy gray outline
&+Lof a once-prosperous voyager ship.  Just north of here, the northern
&+Lmast post can be seen, and a perfect replica of the same mast post
&+Llies to the south as well.  This center junction on the ghost ship
&+Ljoins the Port and Starboard sides, but, however, the entire ship is
&+Lwithout life, resting here in complete frozen de-animation.  A large
&+Lblack trapdoor rests open to the inner chambers of the Ultranos below.
&+LThe only type of color in the area emits from below - a faint blue haze.
