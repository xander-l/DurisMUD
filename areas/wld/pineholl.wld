   Tall evergreens, spruce and different varieties of pine trees, tower
over everything in the area.  Everything about the forest is feels
peaceful and serene.  Bushes scattered throughout the dense forest are
dotted with small &+Rred&N, &+Yyellow&N, and &+mpurple&N flowers, adding
color to the darkness.  Everything here smells like fresh pine needles,
and the aroma, along with the cool breeze that brings it, is very
pleasant.  A narrow trail leads up into the mountains to the south and
the forest continues to the north.

   The ancient trees rise upward to block out almost every bit of
light.  What little light reaches the ground is eagerly gobbled up by
the small bushes that are scattered throughout the area.  Cool breezes
shake the branches high above, but the trees themselves provide a
blanket of security, protecting everything beneath them from the
elements above.  Moss lines the ground in the shadier parts of the
forest, and small bushes and saplings do their best to take up the sun
that makes it through.  The forest continues in every direction.

dwarfed by some of the tremendous pines that thrust their way into the
sky here.  Some of these trees are so ancient that they have an aura of
untold wisdom and knowledge.  A strange feeling about this part of the
forest almost suggests that it is hiding something, though how this
feeling is generated is a mystery.  The forest teems with life as it

trickling water to the north where there appears to be a small clearing
of some sort.  Majestic pines surround the area like silent sentries
keeping watch.  The trees themselves are so old that seem to have an

something oddly discomforting that seems to drive all creatures away.

   An ancient fountain stands in ruins in this small clearing.  It is
hard to tell exactly what the fountain looked like when it was first
put here, or who put it here in the first place.  Water still trickles
out of one spot of a broken statue in its center and pools in its
marble basin.  Dead birds and other animals lie near the fountain, and
most of the vegetation nearby seems to have been killed by water that
has splashed out of the fountain.  At the same time though, a peaceful
doe is seen taking a deep drink from the fountain and bounding off into
the forest at startling speed.

   Like everywhere else in the forest, it is quiet here.  It is a
strange quiet though, there is something quite sinister about it,
something that even the animals that normally roam the forest must feel
for there are no animal tracks to be seen.  There is a strange wide
pond to the north that seems to surround a large, square field of
grass, almost as if it is some sort of moat.  A steep mountain to the
east blocks any easy travel in that direction, but the forest continues
to the south and west, and there is a deep looking pond to the north.

   The forest here is utterly devoid of animals, there aren't even any
animal tracks to be seen.  A sinister air seems to have come over this
place, a feeling that urges one to turn back deeper into the forest.
The forest continues in all its splendor and beauty to the south, east,
and west.  There is a strange moat to the north that seems to surround
a square field of short grass.  At times the field shimmers and the
faint outlines of a large castle or tower can be seen, but the vision
quickly disappears.  When the light shines just right, one can almost
make out a &+Wtranslucent drawbridge&N of some sort that seems to rise up
into nothingness.

   At first glance this part of the forest appears to be like the rest,
yet closer examination reveals certain oddities.  The first is that
there are no animals or animal tracks here, it is as if all the animals
of the forest have decided that this is NOT the place to be.  Yet
another oddity, none of the scattered bushes here have any flowers, and
most of the plants here seem to be a bit sick.  Something sinister has
invaded here, something that continually urges anyone here to head back
into the forest to the south.  There is a strange pond or moat to the
north that surrounds a large square field of grass, if one stares long
enough the field shimmers and the faint outlines of a castle or tower
can be made out, but the vision soon fades to reveal only blowing
grass.  The forest continues to the south, east, and west, and there is
a strange pond or moat to the north.

   Some unseen force urges everyone, and everything, to go elsewhere.
Whatever power it is, it is at least strong enough to drive all the
animals deeper into the forest for there aren't even any animal tracks
here.  Even the trees and bushes appear to have been affected, they
have a sickly cast to them, and seem somehow 'droopier' than those in
the rest of the forest.  The forest continues in all directions, but it
seems to only want people going to the south or west.  There is a
strange pond to the northwest that surrounds a large square-shaped
field of grass like a moat.

   Beauty and tranquilty wash over this area, maiking the forest,
though dark, an attactive and peaceful place.  It is hard to imagine
anything bad about this forest.  Then again, part of the quiet is due
to the soft bed of pine needles that lines the ground and the bushes
scattered around.  They absorb even the small sounds of the animals
that flit back and forth through the forest.  The whitened bones of a
large deer lie beneath a bush to the southwest, reminding travelers
that the laws of nature are still in command here, and that nobody is
truely safe.  The forest continues in every direction.

   &+RRed&N and &+Yyellow&N flowers dot some of the bushes that have found places
to grow beneath the thick tree trunks that shoot upward into the sky.
The tremendous spruce and pine trees that stand here do so with a
strength and fortitude that can only be admired.  Many of these trees
are older than the oldest elves, and several seem so ancient that it is
awe-inspiring to ponder what they have witnessed in their long lives.
Though there are no paths here, the ground beneath the trees has been
padded with a soft layer of pine needles and is relatively easy to
travel in any direction.

   The massive pine trees that thrust their way toward the heavens here
have a majesty that adds to the beauty and tranquility of the forest.
At times, animals can be seen darting through the trees, but the trees
themselves, as well as the soft bed of pine needles on the ground,
absorb the sounds of the forest, giving this area a peaceful aura.  The
peacefulness may be misleading though, a quick cry rings out in the
distance, to be swallowed again by silence.  It is clear that the laws
of nature still rule here, and that caution is the key to survival.

   The ancient trees rise upward to block out almost every bit of
light.  What little light reaches the ground is eagerly gobbled up by
the small bushes that are scattered throughout the area.  Cool breezes
shake the branches high above, but the trees themselves provide a
blanket of security, protecting everything beneath them from the
elements above.  Moss lines the ground in the shadier parts of the
forest, and small bushes and saplings do their best to take up the sun
that makes it through.  The forest continues in every direction.

   The feeling in the forest here is quite different, though still
peaceful there is the impression of underlying tension.  It is much
lighter here because there is a wide open clearing to the west.  In
fact, it almost seems as if the clearing is the source of the tension.
Despite the constant impression that the forest is inhabited by nothing
but wildlife, the clearing to the west proves that heavy logging has
been going on, and seems to be moving in this direction.  The forest
continues to the north, south, and east, and there is a clear-cut area
to the west.

   All the trees here have been cut down and hauled away, leaving
nothing but desolate stumps and lonely bushes that have begun to wither
in the bright sunlight.  Loggers have been hard at work here, and to
the north and west.  It is clear that the loggers that have been
working here have no concern for the animals, or even the forest that
has been supplying them with lumber.  Old pine needles, small broken
branches, and sawdust have been left here to dry in the sun, creating a
fire hazard that nobody seems concerned about.  The clearing continues
to the north and west, and thick forest is to the south and east.

entire area clear, even small saplings have been trampled and left to

   There is something mournful and quiet about this area.  It is hard
to feel that such brutal clear-cutting of the forest is anything other
than a rape of the land.  Loggers have foolishly cut everything down
here.  If they were smart enough to leave just a few of the larger
trees behind new saplings would grow much more quickly and be ready for
logging much sooner.  A broad rocky mountain face extends along the
southwestern edge of the clearing blocking the way, but the clearing
continues along the base of the mountains to the north and east.

   A stockade-type wall can be seen further to the northeast, showing
where at least some of the lumber ripped from the forest has gone.  The
senseless clearing of every living tree from this stretch of land is
appalling, it is no wonder animals in the deeper forest give all other
creatures such careful, studying glances.  There is a single
particularily large tree stump here from a tree that must have been
over three thousand years old.  The tree itself must have been huge,
able to supply tremendous amounts of lumber, the way the forest has
been cut down here suggests that if it were a scrawny nothing of a tree
it would still have been felled.  Steep mountains block the way to the
north and west but the clearing continues to the south and east.

   This must have been one of the first areas that was cut down.  The
scattered bushes that were left behind haven't been able to stand up to
the direct sunlight and have begun to wither and die, their flowers
drooping to the ground.  Not a single sapling has been left here, even
small saplings can be cut down and sold for use as walking staves, or
for the creation of wands.  The area seems desolate and lonely,
completely unlike the peacefulness of the forest.  The clearing
continues in every direction.  A stockade-type wall can be seen further
to the north, obviously protecting some sort of small logging village.

strange pond to the east that appears to be more of a moat that
surrounds a large square-shaped field of short grass.  When one stares
at the field long enough it seems to shimmer and one can make out the
faint outlines of a castle or tower, but the vision soon dissipates
leaving one questioning their sanity.  The forest continues to the

   Made of thick tree trunks that have been planted upright in the

construction.  Why the villagers built it is unclear, none of the
forest animals would normally have anything to do with a village, no
matter how small.  Whatever their reason, there has certainly been
enough lumber taken from the forest to build many walls like this.  One
hopes that the loggers that have so brutally cleared these lands have
profited enough to stop soon.  Nothing has even had time to try to grow
back here.  The clearing continues along the wall to the west and to
the east where there is an entrance to the village, as well as
continuing to the south.

are no guards, and it is clear that nobody really cares what goes on
around them.  This appears to be a village of convenience, built and
kept up for only as long as it takes to make a profit so that people
can move on.  A thick evergreen forest can be seen to the south, and
clear-cut areas extend along the stockade wall to the east and west.  A

would appear that not even loggers are allowed here, for the corpse of
a logger lies beside one of the hugest trees in the entire forest.
Somebody, or something, didn't want him to touch that magificent tree.
He lies on his back with his axe flung backwards over his head, his

&+LOn a Mountain Trail&N~
   Heading both south and down here, the trail is lined with several
small bushes with sharp thorny needles.  Several of the bushes have
beautiful &+Yyellow&N flowers that add color to the othwerwise drab gray of
the surrounding stones.  Down below this point the high tops of several
ancient pine trees can be seen waving slowly in a gentle breeze.  A
flash of some sort of &+Bblue&N quartz can be seen running through one of
the rocks high above but nothing else here seems terribly interesting.

&+LOn a Mountain Trail&N~
   The trail narrows a bit as it heads north along a thick patch of
brush, but is still as easy to travel as the gentle slope that heads
upward.  Walls of stone rise up on every side, making it difficult to
see anything other than the trail.  Protection provided by the rocks
doesn't really outweight the beauty of the view they conceal, but there
is little choice but to continue and hope that the trail opens up a bit
more.

   Gradually sloping up and down here, the trail is still easy to
travel, though a bit hard on the feet.  Everything here is barren
stone, and many of the edges are quite sharp, an unwary traveler could
easily stumble and injure themselves on the sharp rocks.  This trail
must have been created at some time by running water, but whatever
water ran through here has found another route.  The rocks have been
cracked by the constant exposure to harsh sunlight and the chill of the
dark nights.

looking forlorn and lonely.  All of its berries have been stripped away
by passersby and several of its branches have been torn off.  It has no

   This small clearing has clearly seen frequent use as a rest stop.  A
&+ysign&N stands here near the trail that heads off to the south, and
several small bushes do their best to cling to the barren stone.  A
small ring of stones in the center of the clearing shows where several
people have camped in the past, but the dirt in the center is cool,
nobody has set a fire here for a long time.  Small mountain trails head
off to the north and south.

&+yA Flat Mountain Path&N~
   This wide path once had small bushes and saplings on it, but all
these plants have been crushed down and killed.  Flat and dusty now,
the trail has a gently slope upward, and heads downward toward a forest
clearing beside a small village.  The village below has a large
stockade wall made of tree trunks that have been planted upright in the
dirt.  The village itself looks quite tiny, though a fair number of
people can be seen moving around in it.  Quick study of the ground
reveals that a number of large tree trunks have been dragged up this
slope, as well as many heavy wagons.

chance against the thin pines.  There is a lot of thick brush here, but
nothing so bad that the forest can easily be traveled to the north and

prevents climbing in those directions.

tremendous sliding gate is suspended above this point, held in place by
ropes that must be tied down somewhere inside the village.  The gate,
as well as the stockade wall that protects the village seems to be a
bit more than is required.  Even the more dangerous forest animals

&+yA Road Along the Stockade Wall&N~
   Massive tree trunks have been used to create a high, solid wall of
wood that is able to protect the village from almost any attack.  Oddly
enough, whoever designed this wall really didn't do a very good job.
There are no arrow slits for firing out of the wall, and there is no

&+yThe End of a Dirt Road&N~
   The dirt road ends here beside a jagged mountainside that the
stockade wall has been built against.  The village itself seems well
situated for defense, it is tucked into a niche between two steep
mountains and the huge stockade wall protects the only open side of the
village.  Despite its massive proportions, the wall itself is poorly
designed and would provide little real protection against a real
attack.  A sturdy pine door leads into a small log cabin to the north

   Though not the riches of decorations, this small home has been
decorated with excellent taste.  A sturdy bed rests along the western
wall and a small kitchen has been carefully created in the northeastern
corner.  Beside the stove is a small stack of firewood and a rack for
pots and pans that has been attached to the wall.  Four chairs surround
a small carefully decorated table in the middle of the room.  A sturdy
pine door leads outward to the south and a small window in the western
wall faces only the jagged mountainside, giving no real view of
anything at all.

&+yA Dirt Road Along the Stockade Wall&N~
   A large log cabin to the north has been built with the same style as
the massive stockade wall.  It was built to be big, sturdy, and
immobile.  It is also similar to the stockade wall in that it isn't
terribly well designed.  The cant of the roof is off a bit and when it
rains all the water will clearly run off the roof in a river, right in
front of the door.  The door itself is a bit warped, and looks as if it
was tossed there as a last minute touch.  The dirt road continues to
the east and to the west where it ends beside a steep mountain.  A
warped door to the north enters the huge log cabin.

&+yA Dead End&N~
   The dirt road comes to an end here between the stockade wall to the
south, a large cabin to the north, and the slick, steep mountain to the
west.  Nothing here is of any real interest, the workmanship of the
wall and the log cabin has no fine touches.  In fact, most of the
workmanship that can be seen in this village is shoddy, it seems that
as long as one can get several logs to rest atop one another then you
can build a home.  Halfling craftsmen would scoff and such terrible
work, and dwarves would be overcome with fits of laughter.  The dirt
road heads eastward toward the village gates.

be seen.  A number of mining tools line the southern wall, looking
quite out of place in a logging town.  A warped door leads outward to

   Numerous bunk beds, some double, some triple, have been spread out
in the room in a horrible mess.  Dirty clothing has been tossed around,
and left whereever it landed.  The workers that sleep here care little
about good hygiene, in fact it would appear that the only thing this
room is used for is sleeping.  On top of its filth, the place is a
disorganized mess, the only clear spot in the room is clearly beneath a
hole in the room that must leak everytime it rains.  The cabin

based upon what lumber was available at that time.  Very few of the

   The stump of a massive tree that once stood here has been left
behind, probably because the labor to remove it would have been so
intense.  Around the stump, and even on top of it, a number of
different herbs have been planted.  The garden is quite open, anyone
walking along the road to the west could easily walk in and pick
whatever they wanted.  A number of the herbs are hard to identify
though, it might be wisest not to test anything without knowing what it
is.

   The only thing of any importance here in the town square is an
ancient well that contains some brackish water.  For even a small
village, the square, and the streets, seems almost deserted.  The few
villagers that can be seen give visitors angry glances, it is clear
that visitors aren't really very welcome here.  Dirt roads continue in
every direction from this point, with particularily large builings
being visible to the north and west.

has also been set very close to the road.  Both ramshackle buildings
look ready to collapse at any time making this part of the road a bit
uncomfortable to travel on.  The building to the south has an ugly
rough wooden door that is in dire need of some sanding.  The dirt road

   The road ends here by the jagged mountainside.  Two sturdy cabins,
one to the north and one to the south, stand here showing a level of
workmanship not seen anywhere else in the village.  Both cabins have
been built to withstand almost any assault.  In fact, the logs that
have been used in their construction are so thick that it is hard to
believe that there is any room inside them.  A sturdy lock on the door
to the north, and the angry glances of some of the nearby guards,
suggests that something valuable has been hidden there.  The double
doors to the south are unlocked, but also guarded.  Everyone nearby
acts as if there is something important here, something that the
village wants to hide.

&+LA Storage Chamber&N~
   A most unlikely seen unfolds.  This is a logging town, or is
supposed to be, yet this sturdy and heavily guarded room contains huge
bins of raw ore, much of it looking like the ore used to make rare
alloys of &+Bblue steel&N which is used to create some of the finest weapons
in the land.  Any outsiders that enter here are turned away, or even
killed, as quickly as possible.  &+BBlue steel&N is valuable in many
kingdoms, even small amounts can bring in a great deal of money.  It
appears that the villager's greed has led them to protect their secret
carefully.  It is a well known fact that &+Bblue steel&N is difficult to
mine, and even more difficult to work with.  Usually only dwarven
blacksmiths have the skill required to make truely fine weapons of this
metal.  The poor design of the villager's homes suggests that none of
them would have the skill to work with it.  Perhaps if they weren't so
paranoid they would be able to attract some dwarven blacksmiths to help
work the metal, making all that they mine even more valuable.  A pair
of sturdy double doors leads out to the street.

&+LThe Entrance to a Dark Mine&N~
   A blast of heat and curses wafts up from a closely guarded passage
that leads downward into the stone.  Some of the curses are in some
strange tongue, a language that is difficult to identify.  At times the
crack of a whip can be heard, and the bellow of a foreman rises up over
the din.  The sounds seem to echo, as if the narrow passage leads down
into a large chamber of some sort.  A large set of pulleys and ropes is
hung from the sturdy logs that make up the building, clearly designed
to help pull ore up out of the mine.  Exactly what is being mined here
is unclear.  A sturdy locked door leads out to the street.

only thing not made out of unfinished logs is the small shack to the
north, and it seems a bit odd too.  There is not door to the building,
but several strange symbols have been painted over the doorway.
Further to the west a huge column of smoke can be seen rising from a
huge log building.  Nothing here is of much interest, the dirt road
continues to the east and west, though there really isn't anything
exciting there either.

there is no inn here, who would want to stay in a village full of such
rude people?  Just to the west of here is a huge log building that has
been built against the mountainside.  From the rear of the building
there is a huge plume of smoke that rises into the sky, huge amounts of
coal and wood must be being used there.  A rickety door leads into a

   Oil lanterns have been hung from every wall of this small cabin, and
it is a good thing too, there are no windows to let in any light.
Everything in this home is made of rough lumber hastily nailed
together, with the exception of a fine ebonwood desk that lies against
the eastern wall.  The desk stands out as a shining example of fine
workmanship, and is undoubtedly worth more than the entire home and
everything that is in it.  The kitchen is filthy, yet it looks like it
is only rarely used.  Something in the kitchen has begun to rot, and
the stench alone is enough to bring tears to one's eyes.  A rickety
door leads back out of the home.

size and the thickness of the logs used in its creation, the building
is poorly built.  Narrow gaps can be made out between the logs that
make up the walls, though the gaps aren't enough to see through, they
certainly let in wind and water.  The building itself is about 40 feet
tall and stretches back over 100 feet along the steep mountainside to
the west.  A huge column of smoke rises up from the rear portion of the
building as if there is some sort of huge furnace there.  A heavy door
made of thick logs blocks entrance into the building, but it doesn't
appear to be locked.  The road heads back eastward toward the center of

to create ignots of &+Bblue steel&N that can be sold or traded.  The duergar
slaves are clearly not pleased with their plight, and keep a careful
eye on their overseers for any possible chance to escape.  Duergar
dwarves, are masterful craftsmen when it comes to working metals, and
clearly refuse to do anything for their human masters other than
smelting down the ore.  It is clear from the hate in their eyes that
they intend to kill their masters and escape, they are simply waiting

   Several huge loggers, and a few men dressed like miners, stand
beside a long bar smoking long cigars and drinking whiskey.  There are
no windows or other openings to let the smoke out, so it hovers in the
air slowly filling the room until the door to the tavern is open
letting some of it escape.  Most of the men here are quite boisterous,
and several are clearly eager to pick a fight.  None of the villagers
goes out of their way to even speak to visitors though, and the
bartender simply looks the other way when one tries to make an order.
Evidently the villagers don't want company, and seem to go out of their

from somewhere else because the only trees nearby are several varieties
of pine trees.  The logs of the building have been carefully planed and
fit together to create a stable, solid building that looks ready to
withstand just about anything.  The building itself has been built
against a rough cliff that rises upward to the north.  The cliff slants
slightly running along the northwest side of this area until it meets a
more gradual, but still steep, mountainside.  An &+yoak door&N leads into

that there are no windows here, make this room seem dark and somewhat

the desk, which seems to have a presence of its own.  Despite the
formal and imposing furnishings, there is a faint layer of dust on the
desk that would suggest it isn't used very often.  A small open doorway

along the entire shaft keeping it very brightly lit.  Though the shaft
clearly extends quite a ways down, it is a bit unreasonable to keep it
so brightly lit.  Below this point the shaft doesn't seem quite as
steep, but it is still as well lit as it is here.  A surprising waste
of money in a village that can't even spend the time and money to build
proper buildings.

&+LA Well-Lit Mine Shaft&N~
   The villagers have kept this mine a secret, though why is still a
bit unclear.  They are so jealous and paranoid that they attack any
foreigners that have been so bold as to enter the mine.  Further
exploration should be done with great stealth, for it only takes one
villager to sound the alarm.  Distant sounds echo through the shaft, as
if it leads to a large chamber of some sort.  Angry cursing in some
foreign tongue and the crack of a whip can be made out above the sounds
of hammers and picks.  The shaft makes a gradual slope downward to the
south wear it bends east and a steep grade leads upward out of the
mine.

&+LA Well-Lit Mine Shaft&N~
   The echoes and sounds are louder here, the shaft clearly leads down
to some sort of hollow chamber or cavern, nothing else would explain
the distortion of the sounds that make their way upward from below.  A
number of large torches have been used to light the shaft.  With the
bright light it is easy to see the groves that have been left behind by
heavy carts that must be regularly dragged out of the mine.  The shaft
bends from north to east here.  To the north it climbs upward and to
the east it makes a sharp drop downward.

   Thick black smoke from the large torches hung about the room rises
swiftly upward out of the shaft, and some sort of faint breeze seems to
be coming from further below.  The shaft has a more gradual slope as it
continues downward to the east but gets steeper as it climbs upward to
the west.

&+LA Well-Lit Mine Shaft&N~
   The shaft bends north here where it clearly meets a massive cavern
of some sort.  Lanterns and torches have been hung everywhere, shedding
bright light on everything in the area.  It is no wonder the villagers
spend so little money on their homes and buildings, most of their money
must go toward torches and lamp oil.  The crack of a whip echos through
the shaft, and the below of a foreman can be heard, urging people to
work harder.  The cavern to the north looks as brightly lit as this
narrow mine shaft, though why it is so well-lit is unclear.

&+YA Brightly Lit Cavern&N~
   Despite the high ceiling of jagged stalactites, the cavern is
extremely well-lit.  One possible reason for the bright lighting is
that nasty creatures sometimes make their homes in dark caverns such as
this, and bright light tends to drive such creatures away.  Another,
perhaps more appalling reason has to do with the shackled slaves that
can be seen chained to the cavern wall further to the east.  The
figures are small and stout, about the size of dwarves, but there is
something different about them.  The cavern continues to the north and
also to the east where slaves can be seen shackled to the walls.

&+YA Pen of &+LDuergar&N &+YSlaves&N~
   The villager's secret is clear now.  They don't have any mining
skills whatsoever.  Somehow they have captured a small clan of Duergar
and have enslaved them, forcing them to do all of the work.  The bright
lighting is painful to the dark dwarves and makes them a bit easier to
control.  Several of the slaves shackled here have basically collapsed
from exhaustion, having worked far more than is reasonable.  Despite
their exhaustion, their grim faces bear a determined look about them,
it is clear that they will use any opportunity to overthrow their
masters and slay them.  The massive cavern continues to the north and
west.

&+YA Brightly Lit Cavern&N~
   Even the stalactites hanging from the cavern roof high above can be
seen in the bright light shed by the torches and lanterns that have
been spread throughout the area.  Fortunately, there are a few
stalagmites large enough to hide behind, village guards and duergar
slaves can be seen throughout the cavern digging up ore.  One would
guess that the duergar must have been surprised while mining one day,
and enslaved by the human overseers.  Though clearly exhausted, the
duergar move like they have a purpose, most likely the slaying of their
foremen, and any other human they come across.  It is no wonder the
races from the dark caverns deep beneath the surface hate the races
from the surface so much, it would seem reasons for hatred are created
by both sides.  The brightly lit cavern continues in every direction.

   Cries of anger and rage are mixed with the crack of whips and the
pounding of hammers and picks.  Torches and lanterns have been hung
everywhere, their smoke adding an oily taint to the air.  Human
overseers can be seen in the northeast corner of the cavern working a
large group of duergar slaves, and smaller groups can be seen moving
through the cavern looking for new veins of ore.  Duergar have a
reputation for being excellent craftsmen, as well as being vile and
evil.  It would seem their human overseers can match their cruelty
however, even the duergar give them a wide berth.  The cavern continues
to the north and east.

   Lose rubble from a relatively recent collapse of one of the cavern
walls lines the floor.  The cavern is well-lit here, in fact the cavern
would appear to be well-lit everywhere.  Torches and lanterns flicker
here and there as they begin to run low on oil, but there are so many
that they are easily filled or replaced before any darkness encroaches
upon the area.  The cavern continues to the north and west.

   The &+Bblue steel&N ore that is being mined here is quite valuable, no
doubt valuable enough to easily pay for all of the oil and torches
being used to light this massive cavern.  Groups of guarded duergar are
led around by human guards as they search for additional veins of ore,
and a large mining party can be seen at the northern edge of the
cavern working at what must be a large vein of ore.  The cavern
continues to the north, south, and west.

&+YA Brightly Lit Cavern~
   There is something eerie about this cavern, and the way human
overseers are so easily manipulating duergar slaves.  Lanterns and
torches light the cavern so well that it is hard to believe that
anything could possibly remain hidden.  The duergar are very clever
though, and one would presume that the first error their human guards
make will be the last.  The huge cavern extends in every direction.

&+YA Brightly Lit Cavern&N~
   It is clear that this massive cavern is quite ancient, and the
rotting corpse of some strange creature lieing here shows that once
other creatures owned this territory.  The human villagers from above
have invaded and taken over though, through the use of brute force and
bright lights they have chased away or killed any of the creatures that
threatened them.  It is probably a good thing the villagers have kept
their enslaving of the duergar a secret, there aren't many civilized
groups that would approve of such a thing.  Mountain dwarves hate
duergar so much that they would probably invade just to kill the
slaves, though the mine might be attractive too.  The massive cavern
continues in every direction.

&+YA Collapsed Area in the Cavern&N~
   There was once some sort of shaft or cavern that led further into
the mountains here.  It has been deliberately collapsed and filled in
to prevent any creatures from below entering the cavern.  This was
probably done after lighting the cavern and hunting down any
threatening animals or duergar.  The cavern continues to the east, the
collapse of the tunnel here is so complete that no amount of digging
will ever allow passage in that direction again.

   Stalactites hanging from the ceiling here have flattened points, as
if their sharp ends have been deliberately broken off for some reason.
Human overseers and duergar miners can be seen further to the east
working a large vein of &+Bblue steel ore&N.  Other smaller groups can be
seen wandering the cavern searching for new spots to begin mining.  It
is clear from the shouts and the almost constant cracking of whips that
the human villagers intend to work the duergar to death, before leaving
the cavern in peace.  The cavern continues to the south and east.

   The wall of the cavern further to the north and also to the west
contains a large vein of &+Bblue steel ore&N.  Several groups of duergar
mine the ore under the watchful eyes of human guards and overseers.
The guards watch not only the duergar slaves, but also the cavern
itself, looking for intruders who are attacked on sight.  Despite the
bright light, there are stalagmites along the cavern floor that provide
hiding places to avoid the guards.  The cavern continues in every
direction.

&+YA Large Vein of &+BBlue Steel Ore&N~
   The wide veing of ore can be clearly seen running along the wall
like the trail of a drunken sailor.  To the north it dives down a bit,
with most of the ore being at the level of the floor, but here it is at
about chest height, or head height for the duergar slaves being forced
to work it.  Rich and pure, this vein must contain enough ore to supply
an entire kingdom with &+Bblue steel&N.  Weapons forged with this fine metal
have won kingdoms in the past, perhaps the greedy villagers have
delusions of grandeur.  The cavern continues to the north, south, and
west.

   The wide vein follows the wall of the cavern as it bends from south
to west, zigging and zagging like a wounded deer.  Angry duergar slaves
pick slowly at the vein, giving angry glances at their human overseers.
Rough stone has been broken away in an almost random fashion.  It is
clear the duergar slaves that have been working here are doing their
best to be inefficient, and that their human overseers have no real
notion of what they are doing.  The vein of ore continues along the
wall to the south and west.

&+YA Large Vein of &+BBlue Steel Ore&N~
   A large amount of work has been done in this area and it appears
that the vein of ore here has been almost completely mined out.  Clever
duergar have convinced their human overseers to waste more time mining
here, giving the slaves more time to plot an escape.  The constant
crack of whips that echoes throughout the cavern hints at the abuse the
duergar have been enduring.  One would guess that if they get free they
will kill all of the villagers that they can find.

opens up to a small room to the east.

   Careful stonework has turned the walls of this place into a

recently used.  Small, narrow holes line the walls, though the holes are
small, they appear to be very deep.  Why the holes have been drilled is
a complete mystery.  Perhaps this was a duergar home or rest area of
some sort before the humans invaded the cavern and took them prisoner.

   Cloaked in darkness this would appear to be the hiding place for
several duergar that have so far escaped the villagers that have
captured their fellow clansmen.  Strange maps with odd markings have
been posted on the wall along with a schedule of times.  The times
appear to be the times that the guards and workers above take their
breaks.  It would appear that the duergar that have been hiding down
here intend to free their clansmen and slay the villagers that captured
them.  This huge room extends to the north and east.

capture, it is clear that they will have to use every bit of dark
cunning they possess to free their clansmen.  Several ruined suits of
armor rest against the wall, it would seem there are more suits of
armor than duergar.  The duergar have ruined the armor in case they too
are captured, they know the villagers aren't capable of repairing it as
easily as they are.  The large room continues to the south and east.

can be repaired.  The equipment here isn't sufficient for making new
weapons or armor, but there is enough here to make certain the armor
and weapons are in good shape.  Weapons and armor that can be seen here
suggest that the few duergar that escaped are mainly warriors or guards
of some sort, though there would seem to be so few that they will have
a very difficult time rescuing their clansmen.

   A heavy stone door in the eastern wall looks imposing enough on its
own.  Carvings of dead and dieing humans give it a macabe, evil aura
that seems to fill the room.  Duergar hate for the humans that have
basically destroyed their clan shows in every figure that has been
carved into the door.  One carving even shows a duergar warrior
triumphantly slaying a human child.  Evil and hate are so powerful here
that one can almost touch them.  The large room continues to the north
and west, and the heavy stone door in the eastern wall leads deeper
into the mountain.

human, and every surface creature he can find.  Strange symbols have
been drawn on all of the walls, though what significance they have is
unclear.  Several chains hang from the eastern wall, a &+rpool of blood&N
beneath them suggests that someone has been 'questioned' here.  A
carved stone bed and heavy stone desk stand along the southern wall,
the desk looking like it sees more use than the bed.  Every thing in
the room screams hatred and anger, as if the very air is ready to lash
out and strike something just for being there.  A heavy stone door in
the western wall leads out of this dark room.
