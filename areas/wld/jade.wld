&+yA Wheelhouse&n~
&+y   This wheelhouse uses a large water wheel built along the east side
&+yof the &+GJade&+y river to power a set of gears that grind &+Wrice&+y into a paste
&+ythat is used for several different purposes as well as the local wine.
&+yThe room is fully automated, and usually the only activity here is when
&+ythe local workers are transporting their harvests from the &+Wrice&+y fields
&+yand dropping it off here into the enormous metal containers.&n

&+LThe &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+L District Gates&n~
&+L   This is the border between the capital of &+GJade&+L and area controlled by
&+Lthe &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+L authority.&+G Jade&+L rents out the space to the orcs under quite
&+La few strict conditions, one of which being no fighting anywhere within
&+Lthe city limits. &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+L is only to happy to meet any of the &+gEmpire&+L's
&+Lconditions, as it means they have control of a sizable outpost in the far
&+Least, as well as constant access to one of the largest&+y harbours&+L in the
&+Lentire world. Though the orcs are allowed free travel around the city,
&+Lmost never leave their outpost other than to travel to the docks, and the
&+Lcitizens and officials of &+GJade&+L never venture into the &+WStorm&+C Po&+crt&+L authority
&+Leither, due mostly because they find it in rather a perpetual state of
&+Lsqualor and filth.

&+LThe &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+L District&n~
&+L   As one enters the area controlled by the &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+W Autho&+crity there
&+Lis a drastic difference in the quality of life. Though &+GJade&+W &+chas a set
&+Lstandard imposed upon the orcs here which they seem to &+Wpush &+cto the limit.
&+LTruthfully, this outpost is probably the tidiest of all &+Wof Storm &+CPo&+crt's
&+Lterrorities, though is still a massive contrast to the &+Wsheer&+c beauty of
&+Lcity just across the bridge to the west. From here one &+Wcan s&+cee the orc
&+Lwatchtower to the east, as well has many warehouses and&+W barr&+cacks set up
&+Lalong the northeastern area of the outpost. The gate ou&+Wt is &+cjust west.

&+LThe &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+L District&n~
&+G  Jade&+L, being a city of true neutrality, has no issues wi&+Wth t&+che local
&+Lpopulation of orcs, direct from &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+L. Many of their&+W mon&+cks come here
&+Lto train in this far off land to the east, and though mos&+Wtly &+cwelcome in
&+Lthe city itself, tend to stick to themselves in their own&+W cla&+cimed terrority.
&+LThough it is common to hear of skirmishes between the man&+Wy vi&+csiting human
&+Lpilgrams, they are usually brief and dealt with harshly o&+Wn bo&+cth sides by
&+Lthe &+GJade &+gEmpire&+L.&n

&+yBefore a Watchtower&n~
&+y   A small path off the main road of the district leads to a familiar land-
&+ymark in any of &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+y's many outposts, a watchtower than looks out over
&+ythe surrounding area. The ramshackled door to the tower lies north, barely
&+yhanging on by its hinges, but even so, simply by looking directly upwards
&+yfrom here, any one of the several &+barchers&+y in the crowsnest could easily
&+yfire an arrow down into one's skull, ramshackled door be damned.

&+yThe Base of a Watchtower&n~
&+y   Watchtowers are one of the common signs of the orcs of &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+y. In
&+ynearly every one of their many outposts, the distinguishing towers can
&+ybe seen rising up above the rest of their camps, with the storm crest flag
&+ywaving proudly in the air from the tip.  The watchtowers are one of the
&+yfirst structures the orcs construct when founding a new outpost, and as
&+ya result appear rickety and flimsy, however they are in fact quite sturdy
&+yand combined with experienced &+barchers&+y work quite well as a primary defense
&+ybuilding.

&+yA Storage Area&n~
&+y   This is one of the numerous walk-in warehouses that line the paths of the
&+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+y district in &+GJade&+y. It seems the orcs here have more storage space
&+ythan anything else, but just what is in the hundreds of containers is any-
&+yones guess.  One would imagine everything from stolen goods, to pirated
&+yplunder, to weapons of little destruction, to just pure old fashioned junk.
&+yLike the other storage areas, there is a &+Lshed&+y set up here for organizing
&+ytools and items, and this one is actually accessable without sifting through
&+ymounds of litter.

&+ya testament to the naval orcs treatment of the lesser workmen. The walls
&+yand roof are just planks of wood, and the floor is left bare earth. There
&+yisn't even beds for the workmen, just some straw strewn upon the ground.

&+yThe North Bridge&n~
&+y   The north and south bridges are identical in construction and quite a
&+ysimple design. A simple wooden arch serves as a walkway across the &+GJade
&+yriver, elevated just enough to allow some of the smaller passenger rafts
&+yto pass underneath.  Cherry trees in large earthenware pots are placed as
&+ydecoration along the length of the bridge. The north bridge here connects
&+ythe northern beach area to the harbour.

&+ypier. They are fairly simple wooden mooring points, each supported by
&+yheavy wooden beams planted deeply into the ocean floor.  There is about
&+ythree large iron brackets fastened onto the piers for tying up ships in
&+yport, able to secure boats of almost any shape or size.&n

&+LEntry Hall of the Assassin Guild&n~

&+Lhere and the rest of the city of Jade seems unmeasurable. Outside there
&+Lwas light, vibrant colours, and beauty. Here there is nothing except black
&+Lwalls, a sense of foreboding, an a quiet hush that replaces serenity with
&+Lfright. Perhaps one would be better off walking back outside, and making
&+Lsure the door to this placed remains locked forever.&n

&+y   This stretch of beach lies at the northe&+brn tip of the city of Jade.
&+yThe chill water laps up against the rocks&+b and hardened earth as seagulls
&+ycaw overhead. As the beach stretches ou&+bt to the east it goes directly below
&+ythe shipyards and the impressively lo&+bng pier of the city. The smell of salt
&+ywater is extremely strong and a pow&+berful fish scent fills the air.&n

&+yThe bui&+Wlding itself is built in the same design of much of Jade, th&+yough it
&+yhas act&+Wually been built several feet out on the ocean coastline, wi&+yth large
&+ybamboo stilts supporting it up high enough to remain dry even during high
&+ytides or stormy weather. A small bridge leads out the door to the palisades
&+yto the &+Wsouth. A donation plate is set up for those wishing to respe&+yct the
&+yfour Gu&+Wardians through monetary means and the sweet fragrance of bu&+yrning
&+yincense&+W fills one's nostrils.  A spiral staircase leads up to the c&+yenter.

&+ya three foot high iron fence has been built to keep out any of the many

&+yare borderline marshes, but they are kept clean and free of the many

&+g   This is the edge of the wilds of &+GJade&+g, a dank and dark jungle &+mswamp&+g that
&+gthe locals try their best to avoid due to the countless dangers that lurk
&+gbehind every rotting bamboo tree.  The wilds themselves are separated into

&+gwater seeps into the soil that it becomes almost unwalkable. The southern
&+gjungle area is dryer, but no less dangerous, as the beasts that hunt in
&+gmarshland have no qualms about tracking their prey to solid land.  A large
&+gwarning &+Wsign&+g has been hastily stuck into the soft earth here.

&+LThe Fifth Floor of the Assassin Guild&n~
&+L   The inside of the assassin guild is indentical in design other than the
&+Lalternating staircases that lead up and down between floors. The darkness
&+Land the silence are both tools used for the training of the assassins as
&+Lit promotes their stealth and shadowing tactics. Without much surprise it
&+Lis obvious the assassins who make this building their hideout don't much
&+Lappreciate visitors or anyone not in their tight circle of vicious killers
&+Land are only too happy to practice their murder skills on any intruders.

&+LThe Assassin Guild Arena&n~
&+L   Here, at the center of the top floor of the assassin guild, a small
&+Lcombat ring has been set up, for a more organized form of skill practice.
&+LThough it seems to be a contradiction that assassins would actually test
&+Ltheir skills within an area, with any sort of rules at all, it is most
&+Llikely used only to work on their hand-to-hand combat and martial arts.
&+LThe menancing headmaster stands here, watching his pupils come and go,
&+Land overseeing their progress in the art of death-dealing.

&+LA Dark Attic&n~
&+L   This is the pinnacle of the assassin guild, a dark and fright-inducing
&+Lattic. It also appears to be where the assassins store much of their
&+Lvaluables and the belongings they liberate from their victims.  Like
&+Lthe rest of this loathsome building, there is no window and no light,
&+Land a chill lingers in the air.

&+LA Hidden Cavern of &+rArmageddon&n~
&+L   Though almost everywhere within the tunnels between the &+GJade&+g wilds &+Lis
&+Lmuck and swampland, this seems to be an exception due to the work of the
&+rarmageddon&+L soldiers. Rocks and stones have been fitted into the tunnel walls
&+Lfor support against the tunnel walls as well as defense. As a result the
&+Lair is much easier to breath, the swamp fumes are lessened and the tunnel
&+Ldenizens are void, replaced instead with soldiers of &+rarmageddon&+L, a threat
&+Las dangerous, if not more, than any swamp beast.&n

&+LA Hidden Cavern of &+rArmageddon&n~
&+L   Black rocks and stones have been piled up against the tunnel walls here
&+Lto keep the swamp water from leaking through and into this hidden cavern.
&+LThe army of &+rarmageddon &+Lseems to have a strange fixation with underground
&+Lbases, even in such rugged terrain like this. The hidden cavern itself has
&+Lroom for only maybe a couple dozen soldiers, so it is quite hard to tell
&+Ljust what these anarchists are plotting, deep underground a swamp and in
&+Lthe far off eastern lands.&n

&+LThe General's Cave&n~
&+L   This room is the most well-kept in the entire hidden cavern, nearly a
&+Lpalace compared to the rest of the dark, marsh tunnels. The black rock that
&+Lhas been placed mismatch along the rest of the cavern fully covers this
&+Lroom, and even the floor seems to be finished. It is an obvious example
&+Lof what the orcs of &+Larmageddon&+L are most likely attempting to construct for
&+La staging area for their next invasion.  The small strike force here is
&+Lmost likely trying finish cleaning up the caverns so a larger group can
&+Lmove in, eventually assulting the capital of &+GJade&+L itself.  Several high
&+Lranking members of the army of &+rarmageddon&+L make this area their quarters,
&+Land there is a large bin built here, for tool and weapon storage.&n

&+gThe &+GJade&+g Jungle&n~
&+g   In some locations within the jungle the vegetation grows so thick and so
&+Ghigh it is actually possible to climb up above the jungle floor and towards
&+gthe canopy. In many ways it is much better to try and travel the wilds this
&+Gway as the soft muck of the marshland is replaced by more solid branches,

&+yA Ladder Up the Watchtower&n~
&+y   The watchtower ladder takes great feats of courage to climb. The ladder
&+yrungs appear like they could break off at any moment. Once at the top,
&+yhowever, one is rewarded by quite a breathtaking view of the city, as it
&+yis quite literally the third tallest structure within&+G Jade&+y, second only
&+yto the palace and the assassin guild both off to the west.

&+yThe Top of the Watchtower&n~
&+y   Trademarked by the orcs of &+WStorm&+C Po&+crt&+y, the watch tower is a simple yet
&+yextremely effective design that allows archers to target and sniper off
&+yattacks with ease. The top of the watch tower is like a nest, covered with
&+ya mismatched series of wooden planks that don't appear pretty but do what
&+yis intended of them quite well. A hole in the floor leads to the rickety
&+yladder leading back down.

&+LThe &+ySamurai&+L Guild&n~
&+y   The samurai warrior is unique to the far eastern lands. They are masters
&+yof the blade and exceptional hand-to-hand fighters, but their most impressive
&+yattribute would be their mental focus. Each samurai spends as much time in
&+ydeep meditation as they do in combat training, believing the mind to be the
&+ymost important weapon of all. The room upstairs reflects this, a quiet and
&+yserene meditation room, while here, the lower floor is a dojo where the in-
&+ytense training is done.&n

&+yLike many of the buildings here in the east, it has been built with the
&+yever popular bamboo and thin, dyed wood sheets. An extremely lightweight
&+yladder leads upwards towards the light beacon, a large globe of illumina-
&+ytion, maintained and recharged by the local mystics of &+GJade&+y for the sole
&+ypurpose of guiding ships in and out of the port.&n

&+LThe &+yShipworks&+L Guild&n~
&+y   Like the majority of the other guildhouses, the top floor is used for
&+yrest and relaxation of guild members. It is small yet comfortable and in
&+ythe traditional eastern fashion the are large carpets and pillows spread
&+yover the floor, where those who belong to the guild can sleep and rest
&+ybefore the next shift.  The downstairs is generally where meetings and
&+yofficial business is conducted.

&+LThe &+gPalace&+L Basement&n~
&+L   The basement, though obviously still remarkably construct&+wed, is a much
&+Lmore subdued location of the palace, and indeed the entire c&+wapital city.
&+LIt is much darker here compared to vibrance of the upper lev&+wels, and one
&+Lcan't help shaking the feeling that one doesn't belong here.&+w The palace
&+Lfoundation walls are all built with sturdy, imported granite&+w, and though
&+Lit is extremely strong, it doesn't help much to keep the chi&+wll out. Just
&+Lanother factor leading one to believe that the locals of Jad&+we don't visit
&+Lhere often.

&+LA &+gDecaying &+LTunnel&n~
&+g   As one travels deeper into these infernal tunnels, mobility through the
&+Lrotting muck becomes nearly impossible, and the predators that lurk these
&+mtunnels become increasingly more violent, vicious, and deadly.  Smaller
&+gcreatures of the overland marsh are no longer present, obviously all eaten
&+Lor butchered by the larger beasts here. The tunnel itself is mazelike, and
&+mit is hard to determine who or what made these passageways in the first
&+gplace or if they are some sick and twisted design of nature, for the only
&+Lpurpose of luring in the foolish and devour them once and for all.

&+yA Small Mission&n~
&+y   This is a small and humble log cabin being used by a group of mission-

&+ycities in the west consider the religious beliefs of &+GJade &+yto be backwater
&+yand heathenistic, so every couple months a new pilgrimage, led by the
&+ysomewhat famous &+YSaint &+WMacavor&+y come and stay here, in an attempt to save
&+ythe residents of &+GJade&+y's souls. The citizens of the &+gEmpire&+y tolerate the
&+ymissionaries, treating their preachings with usual good humor, though
&+yrarely show a slightest inkling of interest of what the westerners have
&+yto say.

	Dear family,
	I have gone to assist my fellow Hunters in a distant land
	and shall be gone for quite some time. A great evil threatens
	this entire land, far worse then any Drow, Ogre, or Lich.
	I believe the Sixth Legion to be behind the organized army of
	armageddon, and hopefully, with the help of Roland and the
	others we will be able to stall them. The shadows seem every
	where, though, the battle being waged on many levels, indeed
	even Nansuo plots and schemes for the sake of the Legion and
	shall I find him on my travels, I shall bring him to justice.
					Your loving son,
						Kantara

&+Lfor them, a spy from the city. They are a cruel bunch, but the main
&+Lquestion one needs to ask oneself is, if they are pirates, where is
&+Ltheir boat.&n

&+LA Pirate's Den&n~
   &+LThis appears to be some sort of local recruitment office for the
&+Lpirates. Outlaws of all sorts come and go, speaking to the cunning
&+Lpirate officers about membership. The room itself is like most of the
&+Lcarved out cave, with very dim light and almost no furniture or de-
&+Lcoration.

&+LThe Den of Marn&n~
&+L   Though no where near as famous, ruthless, devious, and dangerous as
&+LFeng Cho, Marn is still quite a deadly foe, constantly organizing raids
&+Lagainst trade and merchant ships just off the coast from here, his damp
&+Land cold lair. Only a couple candles give off any sort of light here,
&+Ljust barely enough for the pirate to gaze over his booty and write up
&+Lplans for his next attack. Salt water seems to leak in from the roof,
&+Lmost likely from the high tide residue that is probably just overhead.

&+LA Pirate's Den&n~
&+L   The cave underneath the harbour stretches along a narrow corridor
&+Lheading east. Several smaller side passages, used for various pirate
&+Ltreasure, training halls, or meeting rooms, split off from the main
&+Ltunnel. The den itself is quite well guarded, angry brigands and
&+Lruffians charge anyone they believe to be an intruder, or worse yet
&+Lfor them, a spy from the city. They are a cruel bunch, but the main
&+Lquestion one needs to ask oneself is, if they are pirates, where is
&+Ltheir boat.&n
