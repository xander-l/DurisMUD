&+LA &+Cpocket &+Lof &+Cair &+Linside the wrecked &+yhull of the ship&+L.&n~
&+yThe inside of the ship has a small &+Cair pocket &+ywhich has likely not been breathed in
&+ysome time yet still has &+Woxygen&+y. A deep sense of &+Ldread &+yand &+Lforboding &+yseems
&+yto permeate the inside of this once massive ship. The smell of &+csea&+Cwa&+cter &+yand
&+Ldecay &+yalso drift into your nostrils. It is best to proceed with extreme caution due to
&+ythe tales that are told about the &+Lcurse &+yplaced upon this ship by &+WPoseidon.&n

&+yBecause the wreck is resting on it's starboard side, the &+Yhatch &+ywhich used to lead below to the &+rgunnery
&+ydeck is now against the southern facing floor.  It appears to have been locked for some reason perhaps
&+yto keep the &+rgunnery &+Lcrew &+yfrom leaving their posts during the epic battles the Cyclops had been in. The

&+yRubble is strewn about here in the aft of the ship, located nearby would be the Captain's Quarters. The fore
&+yof the ship would be where the First Mate's Quarters would be. This would help keep the crew under control of

&+yThe &+CCa&+cpt&+Cai&+cn's &+yquarters were very spacious and the remnant's of oppulent furniture with &+Rvelvet &+yand &+msilk&n
&+yupholstery are strewn about the room. An old desk with sea rot lies on it's side and it's drawers lie&n
&+yopen...all except for one drawer which appears to have a &+clock&+y on it. There is a &+Ycage&+y with a &+Ldead &+Bbird&n
&+Wbones&+y within on it's side in the corner. Shattered &+Ylamps &+yadorn the remnants of the hulls wall beneath&n
&+yyour feet. Broken &+Wdishes &+yand &+rrusted &+Csilverware &+yalso can be seen scattered here.&n

&+LBefore the Hold of the &+yShip&n~
&+yThere is a &+Lhatch&+y to the south that leads into the hold of the ship where the cargo and other precious
&+yitems are stored. It is rumored that the &+LDreadnaught Cyclops&+y carried a vast &+Ytreasure trove&+y when sunk
&+ycarrying an entire treasury shipment to &+CIcecrag&+y during the &+WPlatyr Dynasty&+y. Rumor has it that &+BAuril&+y was
&+ybehind convincing Poseidon to betray the family Platyr by convincing him that they planned to cleanse
&+ythe sea of all merpeople because they believed them to be immoral creatures. What treasures await and
&+yalso consequently, what dangers lie to the south behind the hatch is unknown...

&+yresting on her starboard side, this &+cabandoned &+rgun &+yport is a ghostly reminder of the crew's
&+yfinal moments before they drowned. An old &+Ycannon&+y lies on it's side near your feet. You see
