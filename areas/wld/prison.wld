&+RThe Main Foyer~
&+L   The main foyer of this dark place is well fortified by the &+ciron&+L and
&+Csteel&+L bands that wrap about this room like a &+wribcage&+L. Gaping doors
&+Lbeckon those who have a taste for insolence and injustice. The
&+Latmosphere stiffles those searching for a breath of fresh air. Visiting
&+Lrooms lay to the east and west.

   All around you, guest of wind blow in every direction
as small whirlwinds dance around.
Every so often a small chuck of floating rock can be seen in the distance
and bellowing smoke can sometimes be seen. Gravity does not seem to exist here
and travel looks possible in any direction.

&+RThe Plane of Avernus on the Nine Hells~
   This is a plane of darkness, consisting of rocky crags and hillcocks, a
land of stunted, poisonous vegetation and bare rock. Many concealed pits
lined with filth-smeared stakes and the like have been prepared for intruders.
Avernus has no roads or buildings, but many caves and warrens have been dug
out of the rocks; most are devils' homes as unwary travelers seeking shelter
will soon learn.

&+yThe Elemental Plane of Earth~
   All around you there is nothing but solid rock for as far as the eye can
see. One gets the feeling of being buried alive, surrounded by all of this
living rock. It is pitch black except for the magical light you have with you.
The moss green, to dark brown and black rock color seems to never end.

&+LA Steep Slope~
&+L   The tunnel continues into the darkened abyss below. All senses here seemed
&+Lheightened as sounds, smells, and the feeling of corruption emminates from
&+Lthe lower regions of this vile place. A foyer can be seen glowing vibrantly
&+Lbelow.

&+MEntrance to the &+LPrison of &+mDespair~
&+L   This earthen tunnel slops deep into the earth. Sounds of screaming and
&+Lsmells of pure disgust saturate the air. The floor is composed of a soft
&+glimestone&+L, slowly ebbing away over time as new souls are admitted to
&+Ltheir gloomy eternity.

&+MTh&+me &+YCenter &+Mo&+mf t&+Mhe &+YN&+Ge&+Bx&+Lu&+Cs&n~
&+L   This vault comprises the center of the &+YN&+Ge&+Bx&+Lu&+Cs&n.
&+LIt exists neither on the prime plane, nor that of the immaterial,
&+Lbut is secluded from both.  As such, the rules of the regular world
&+Lfail to apply here.  There is no earth on which to stand, yet the
&+Lair is firm and allows stance.  No sound is able to form on your lips,
&+Lnor any magical incantation or mental exercise able to burst into
&+Lfruition.  Your very wounds cease to bleed, yet do not heal.  Time
&+Litself does not exist in the center of the &+YN&+Ge&+Bx&+Lu&+Cs.&n
