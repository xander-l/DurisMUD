&+LA Large Ravine~
&+L   This huge ravine looks more like a crater. To wander down it would surely
&+Ltake some time and would tax the most strongest of travelers. The tropical
&+Lforest doesn't seem to care of its existence however. Trees and the animals
&+Lthat reside within them are numerous indeed. Something peculiar sticks out of
&+Lthe ordinary however, something similar to that of other forests, game trails.
&+LOnly this can't be a game trail, for no game live within tropical forests,
&+Lwhich leads to one conclusion. Someone else, a humanoid being perhaps, lives
&+Lin this forest. A tough task ahead to discern which being it may be lays ahead.
&+LA large cabin is visible just before the ravine, it looks like a some sort of
&+Lhuman construction from the make of it. It could be a mission.

A Reception Room~
   It looks as though the humans were kind enough to build a reception foyer
to welcome the thri-kreen converts. From the looks of things the only thing
this reception room was used for was for the mass butchering that took place
once it was built. Thri-kreens don't take kindly to intruders into their land,
and they especially don't have the patience to practice any religion. Heads
with flesh long rotten away are visible under overturned chairs and tables.
Tapestries torn down expose the naked wall beneath. Every which way limbs from
the naive humans are visible. The thri-kreen attack must have been so quick,
sudden, and so unexpected that some of the humans were still in their morning
robes not yet dressed.

Sleeping Chambers~
   These sleeping chambers at one time must have been used by a number of
missionaries to sleep in, however, it is barely recognizable for what it once
was however. The only thing discernable within this chamber is the stench of
death, of rotten flesh. Overturned beds and shelves have been set aflame in
some sections of the room, with hacked up human bodies everywhere. It looks as
though the thri-kreen might have attacked during the night, when the humans
were most vulnerable. Idiocity is a human trait, one that both serves as their
protector and demiser. It shields them from the harsh realities of the world,
realities that would be difficult to cope with. However, it also creates in
their minds just how the world should be, which ultimately conflicts with how
things actually are and leads to ignorance, and eventually mortal danger.

The Missionary Lounge~
The priests came here to let out some of the stress of working with
such beasts as the thri-kreen. The task of converting any of them would be
a difficult task at best, as they well knew. They were allowed to do things
here that they may not do under any other circumstance. A small bar counter
runs across the south wall, with racks of aged wine lined up behind it. A
couple of gaming tables are set up in the room also, including a tableau
counter and a hoop raised over head, apparently for some athletic game. There
are several small couches about the large room, and it is not uncommon to find
several of the younger priests napping here in the afternoon.

Top of a &+yTall &nTree~
   From this vantage point one can see clear across the land. Miles and miles
of terrain can be seen clearly from the top of this tree. It would seem that
the thri-kreen have used this as an advantage for they've built a look out
tower of sorts. The station isn't much, however, one key ingredient in it's
construction was that it was built to last. Thri-kreen aren't great mechanics,
nor really are they great at anything besides war. So the thris obviously used
slave labor to build this small station, labor that they eventually ate for
dinner. But, anyway, a small horn is latched to a leather strap near the post.
If anything would ever arise that could present a threat to the colony, this
massive horn would alert all within earshot.

if the need ever did arise, for it must be at least twenty feet deep. Fish
of all sorts must be in the river, which serves as another source of food for
the hawks and other omnivores of the wildlife.

Cabin of the &+CHuman&n &+WMissionary&n~
   Human missionaries believe that all beings have an innate responsibility to
themselves to love they neighbors and themselves. This mission was obviously
established to convert the thri-kreen into fun loving bugs, fun loving bugs
that would no longer prey upon weaker races for food, weaker races such as
the human's themselves, or perhaps any other of their surface dwelling kin.
If anyone would ever wonder what effect this mission had upon the thri-kreen,
all they have to do is take one brief look at the remains of the missionaries.
All of them are either gutted, strewn upon spikes, or butchered into little
pieces. All of them however, have been eaten by the thri-kreen to a greater
or lesser extent.

&+LDeep Within a Ravine~
&+L   The tropical tree's sprout up a good forty feet into the air. The animals
&+Lsirt restlessly within the thick of the forest's ground. Some of the more
&+Lversatile animals fly through the air and land roughly onto other trees. Many
&+Linsects buzz through the air and rummage through the ground. Tropical forests
&+Lare notorious for their ability to weed out the hardened traveler from those
&+Lwho just want to play with nature for a few days. It is here that men are
&+Lseparated from the boys. The ability to withstand a night within this forest
&+Lis highly overestimated, for once you've journeyed far and wide into a tropical
&+Lforest such as this, you'd be forced to stay the night. It is here that the
&+Lants get you. You might wake up in the morning and find yourself one big
&+Lswollen whelp, or you might find that some bat took a scat on your person. Now
&+Lsnakes are a real threat too, you could also wake up to find some boa wrapped

A &+CSmall Pond&n in a Grove~
   Having cleared one's way through a tropical forest one finds himself in a
place of beauty that sticks out in a place of darkness. Tall ancient trees
surround this small pond of crystal blue water. A pair of large rocks sit on
the eat side of the pond creating a small shelf to sit on overlooking the
water. A faint trickle of water is audible, but one can not see from where it
originates. Every now and then fish are visible splashing in and out of the
water, but catching such fish is a tough task. The tropical forest thickens to
the west, and only a fool would be caught in there without the proper supplies.

   The main bulk of the cavern is filled with the festering civilization of
the thri-kreen. The cavern reaches to about a height of a hundred feet, and
spans nearly four times that. All around the cavern are broken stalagmites and
large rock mounds and crevices. Crowing into every nook are straw mounds that
thri-kreens use for sleeping. Thri-kreen are versatile creatures and very agil,
there is no place that they couldn't make that would be adequate to suit them
that they couldn't call a dwelling, or a home.

and now line this section of the forest. Here the thri-kreen's keep cow and
sheep that they have confiscated from nearby human settlements. This supply
of meet keeps the thri-kreen from having to actually hunt for their food which
keep them well nutritioned and seasoned for upcoming campaigns against foes.

A Cleared Pathway~
   The trees have been cut to their base to give way to space. It is obvious
that the trees must have inhibited some sort of work that was in progress, so
they were cut to provide adequate room. A large worn pathway through the
thick vegetation runs northward and southwards. Weeds and vines stick out and
hang around to further inhibit the path of travel, as slight as it maybe.
Whatever kind of work or exhibition that is going must not have been pressed to
further clear the selected path route, for a great many vegetation still makes
the pathway difficult to travel.

   This tree house is little more than a thick wooden platform walled with
bark. The bark is still quite green suggesting these sorts of constructions
must frequently need reconstructing due to the high winds or other destructive
forces. The tree house is quite unorderly suggesting lack of care or whatever
maintenance it requires. The treetop seems to sway quite dramatically and it
could cause one to lose balance and tumble to the ground, causing immediate
death or paralysis. This is obviously a watch tower constructed by some sort
of being, possibly humanoid but who could tell.

   This vertical tunnel seems to have been naturally formed, though its walls
seem to have been carved with artificial handholds, providing a method of
traversing its length with only moderate difficulty. The simple gray rock is
sparkled with the occasional crystal grain, creating a strange affect when
studied from the right angle. Besides the handholds, the walls are rather

&+LA Long Narrow Shaft&n~
   This vertical tunnel seems to have been naturally formed, though its walls
seem to have been carved with artificial handholds, providing a method of
traversing its length with only moderate difficulty. The simple gray rock is
sparkled with the occasional crystal grain, creating a strange affect when
studied from the right angle. Besides the handholds, the walls are rather
rough and marked, with jagged points which reach out to snag falling debris.

&+LTwisting Tunnels of the Wild Underdark~
&+L   The twisting tunnels of the Underdark are known for both their treachery and
&+Lunchanging features. The underground passages are very similar, the small
&+Lgray rock, with its rough surface, making up most of them. It is quite easy
&+Lto become lost in the drab corridors, with very few landmarks to guide the
&+Lway. The tons of rocks pressing in all sides gives the traveler an impression
&+Lof entrapment, which can overwhelm the senses of someone not native to the this
&+Lrealm, and its never-ending features and curvatures.

&+LA Long Narrow Shaft&n~
   This vertical tunnel seems to have been naturally formed, though its walls
seem to have been carved with artificial handholds, providing a method of
traversing its length with only moderate difficulty. The simple gray rock is
sparkled with the occasional crystal grain, creating a strange affect when
studied from the right angle. Besides the handholds, the walls are rather
rough and marked, with jagged points which reach out to snag falling debris.

&+LNearing a &+GPale Glow&n~
&+L   The tunnel slowly becomes wider to the north until it opens into what
&+Lappears to be a massive cavern. A ghostly pale green glow can be seen coming
&+Lfrom this cavern, but at this distance it is too hard to determine what the
&+Lcause may be. This tunnel is made from the gray rock so commonly found in the
&+LUnderdark, its rough walls prove that it was naturally formed. Whatever awaits
&+Lmust not be good.

&+LA Cavern of &+GPhosphoescent&+g Slime&n~
   This cavern is covered with a strange glowing slime, one which casts pale
green light throughout the area. Possibly some sort of fungus, this slime
drips from the ceiling and walls, pooling in large puddles upon the floor. It
is quite thick and sticky, clinging to whatever comes near it. The cavern is
massive, glowing with the ghostly light from edge to edge. Stalactites jut
down from the ceiling quite low in some places, their jagged length dripping
the same slime. The odd scent of mold hangs in the air, mixed with water.

&+yA Dirty Living Area~
   The main bulk of the cavern is filled with the festering civilization of
the thri-kreen. The cavern reaches to about a height of a hundred feet, and
spans nearly four times that. All around the cavern are broken stalagmites and
large rock mounds and crevices. Crowing into every nook are straw mounds that
thri-kreens use for sleeping. Thri-kreen are versatile creatures and very agil,
there is no place that they couldn't make that would be adequate to suit them
that they couldn't call a dwelling, or a home.

&+yA Dirty Living Area~
   The main bulk of the cavern is filled with the festering civilization of
the thri-kreen. The cavern reaches to about a height of a hundred feet, and
spans nearly four times that. All around the cavern are broken stalagmites and
large rock mounds and crevices. Crowing into every nook are straw mounds that
thri-kreens use for sleeping. Thri-kreen are versatile creatures and very agil,
there is no place that they couldn't make that would be adequate to suit them
that they couldn't call a dwelling, or a home.

&nA Chamber Filled with &+yFurs&n~
   Piles of furs, ranging from bear and boar, to deer and fox, take up most
of this room. Their mere presence seems to add warmth tot he cave, thought this
heat can also be contributed to the nearby cooking pit. Furs have been hung
from several locations along the stone walls, warding off any cold that may
try to seep through from the gray rock. A few broken weapons and tattered
pieces of armor can be seen amongst the furs, remains from those who were
ambushed by the thri-kreens years ago. From the plush surroundings it is
obvious that this area is used for sleeping and relaxation, which is peculiar.

&+LA Cavern of &+GPhosphoescent&+g Slime&n~
   This cavern is covered with a strange glowing slime, one which casts pale
green light throughout the area. Possibly some sort of fungus, this slime
drips from the ceiling and walls, pooling in large puddles upon the floor. It
is quite thick and sticky, clinging to whatever comes near it. The cavern is
massive, glowing with the ghostly light from edge to edge. Stalactites jut
down from the ceiling quite low in some places, their jagged length dripping
the same slime. The odd scent of mold hangs in the air, mixed with water.

&+gDen &nof the &+MQueen&n~
   The dirt floor of this cavern is covered with huge booted foot prints,
easily two or three feet in length. Some of these prints are barely visible
underneath the thick layers of dirt and flowers. Crude drawings cover most
of the walls, displaying horrific pictures of thri-kreen smashing various other
humanoids with massive clubs and venomous fangs. There are also a few drawings
of these thri-kreens hunting large boar and rocs The glow of a fire can fills
one with unbound energy and excitement, warming the are with it's illumination.

&+LA Huge Cave Opening&n~
   Huge booted prints lead along the dirt path here, making their way up to
the very entrance of a massive cave. Broken branches from the rugged mountain
bushes have been scattered around the cavern entrance, though they do little
to hide its existence. Over twenty feet across, this gaping hole seems large
enough to contain a fearsome monster. All is silent around the area, even
the birds seeming to prefer a nesting place from this wound on the
mountain's side.

   The ceiling of this spacious cavern stretches far above, easily a hundred
feet from the rough stone floor below. It is shaped like a dome, the center
being much higher than the edges. The gray stone ceiling is rather smooth,
lacking the stalactites that decorate most of the Underdark. Most of the walls
within this cavern are bare, save for the occasional crack or crude drawing
from unorthodox being. Patches of blackish moss seem to grow from some of these
cracks and in small clumps along the floor.

&+Land are enormous enough to instantly crush any living thing that it pleases.

cover the inside of the cavern entrance, growing from the vegetation from the
marsh outside. The tunnel goes deeper into the west, it's darkened depths

ground, creating a slick surface for walking upon. Probably dragged in from

wafts up, overpowering any other odors present. This tunnel seems rather long,
and several side tunnels can be seen branching off along its length.

&+gCavern&n of the &+BKing&n~
   This cavern has been claimed by the thri-kreen chief, his strength and
influence being impressive enough to discourage anyone from moving against
him. A thick layer of fresh moss covers most of the stone floor, it's moist
soil providing a comfortable bedding for the king. The moss sends up the smell
of soil, a strong odor, which wafts through he air and clings to everything.
A few scattered bones can be seen strewn about the cavern, and a few scraps of
leather and rusted metal captured from the trolls that live nearby. Though very
primitive, this living area is among the best available to the lizardman, and
is coveted by them all.

&+LTunnel along a few Shallow Alcoves&n~
   Leading along several shallow alcoves, this dark tunnel seems to be one
of the most traversed in this section of the cavern. Though little mud covers
the area, the endless barrage of passing feet have created a smooth floor.
There appears to be odd scratch marks along the ground at even intervals, as
if the passing of individuals have clawed feet. The alcoves lining this tunnel
range in size from five to ten feet, though some are a bit large than this.

&+LA Shallow Alcove~
This shallow alcove is about ten feet around, more than enough room for a
a few thri-kreen to rest within. The floors have been covered with fresh moss
and bits of moist mud, creating a bedding which is quite soft and cooling.
Because of this bedding, a thickly earthy smell lingers through the alcove,
similar to the scent found in thick swamps. A few discarded strips of leather
and some cracked sticks dot the area, but for the most pat it appears to be
kept rather bare. Scratches cover most of the walls, some in recognizable shapes
and forms. This primitive art provides a past time for the thri-kreen, who
when not hunting or killing have very little to do.

&+LA Shallow Alcove~
   This shallow alcove is about ten feet around, more than enough room for a
a few thri-kreen to rest within. The floors have been covered with fresh moss
and bits of moist mud, creating a bedding which is quite soft and cooling.
Because of this bedding, a thickly earthy smell lingers through the alcove,
similar to the scent found in thick swamps. A few discarded strips of leather
and some cracked sticks dot the area, but for the most pat it appears to be
kept rather bare. Scratches cover most of the walls, some in recognizable shapes

&+rBefore a Primitive Cooking Fire&n~
   A shallow cooking pit roars loudly here, the open flame and thick piles
of charred wood within its heated depths giving off a thick stream of white
smoke, which floats slowly to the ceiling and spreads out looking for some
sort of ventilation. This pit gives off enough illumination to cast a warm
glow throughout this wide cavern, and into the cooking pit, sizzling within
its own fat. Whatever beast spawned these meaty chunks must have been humanoid
due to the fact that most of the cooking masses of flesh have arms and heads.

&+LCavern of the Thri-kreen Warrior&n~
   Most of the smoke from the other tunnels never reaches this cavern, for they
have discovered a thin vent which sucks it away. However, thin tendrils of
smoke occasionally waft in, twirling around the room as it battles against
conflicting drafts of wind. The cavern is about fifteen feet across, though
most of its size is taken up by circular pool of fetid water within it's very
center. The water does not appear to be deep, maybe three feet at the most,
though the strange runes surround the pool's edge gives it a mysterious
appearance. A thick pile of moss and mud has been gathered in one corner of the
room, used as a resting place by the thri-kreen master warrior which dwells
here. Weapons carved from wood and bone decorate the walls, their significance
lost to all but the most skilled in the arts of war.

Within a &+LDark&+y Muck&+Lling Holding Cell~
   The stench of this rather narrow cavern is overpowering, a mixture of mud,
decay, and what could best be described as fear. The walls here are very
moist, dripping with water and warding off the heat from a nearby cooking
pit. Thick tendrils of smoke dance across the ceiling, making breathing within
this confined cavern rather difficult at best. The smallest of cracks can be
seen within the stone above, sucking wave after wave of smoke within. This
small amount of ventilation seems to be the only thing keeping the cavern's
occupants from choking to death. The occupants must indeed be slaves to the
thri-kreen, for they would not keep their own kind within this deathtrap, nor
would they keep them shackled to the walls for their are many empty shackles
in this cavern. The only reason they're empty, probably, is because they're
being worked in the fields.

Tunnel filled with &+LSmoke~
Thick clouds of smoke hug the ceiling of this rather low tunnel, causing
problems for most who travel its length. Due to a poorly ventilated cooking
pit, this smoke stretches out along the stone above, seeking a place to
finally be free. The scent of charred wood and perhaps some sort of meat can
be detected nearby, enforcing the theory of a cooking pit. This area of the
underground caverns is much drier and warmer than the rest, and for that reason
it seems to be avoided by most of the thri-kreen.

Below a &+yMud-Caked &+LPit&n~
   The tunnel here comes to a sudden end, below, appears to be some sort
of hole in the ceiling. Thick streams of mud drip down from the ceiling,
covering the walls as it makes its slow journey down to the shallow pools on
the stone floor. Though the ceiling is almost twenty feet high, several jagged
handholds line the walls, allowing easy access to the passage leading upwards.

&+LAbove a Massive Hole&n~
&+L   A rather large hole in the ground breaks the endless monotony of these
&+Ldrab gray tunnels. The hole is about ten feet across and perhaps thirty feet
&+Ldeep. A few pale lizards can be seen at the bottom of the hole, though the
&+Ldistance makes it impossible to determine how many. The eastern edge of the pit
&+Lis jagged, offering several notches which can be used as handholds. Though it
&+Lmay take awhile, it appears almost anyone would be able to complete the decent
&+Lwithout much difficulty.

&+LA Dark Winding Tunnel~
&+L   The walls of this seemingly endless tunnel twist and turn in several
&+Ldirections, allowing only the most perceptive of individuals to navigate it's
&+Llength without becoming lost. The drab gray stone is every, making up the
&+Lceiling, floor and rough walls. There is little to serve as landmarks, save
&+Lfor the occasional clump of subterranean fungus or mold. The actually size of
&+Lthe tunnels vary slightly, though for the most part they are within five and
&+Leight feet wide. Stalactites and stalagmites are common within this tunnel,
&+Lthough their rocky forms are usually stout and plain.

&+LA Circular Cavern~
   This wide cavern stretches well over a hundred feet across, and perhaps
fifteen feet high. Several stalactites hang down from above, some as slender
as spears and some thicker than an ogre's torso. A few patches of odd fungus
seem to have taken root along the stone walls, but for the most part their
smooth surfaces are bare. The ground here is covered with small chunks of
rocks, possibly left from shattered stalactites that had broken off and
smashed against the hard stone floor. A tunnel leads away from the cavern in
it's northern and western most corners.

&+LA Steep Sloping Tunnel~
   The passageway here slopes downwards at an angle step enough to make
travelling its length quite difficult. The occasional loose pebble makes it
even more hazardous, to the point where a faltering step could prove fatal.
The walls of this tunnel are rather smooth, possibly the work of some ancient
underground river that ran beneath the tropical forest above. Their dark gray
surfaces are without mark, save for the occasional scratch caused by the
passing of a large subterranean creature. A huge rock seems to be protruding
from below, almost as if it were concealing something.

A &+LDark Niche&n in the &+LWinding Tunnels&n~
   This dark niche within the cavern seems to be used by the thri-kreens to
store the loot they have collected from their countless raids against nearby
settlements and passing merchant caravans. Piles of old wooden crates line
the walls, though most are empty or contain useless junk. Barrels of water,
wine, and ale are stacked in one corner, usually used to celebrate a major
victory. Old tapestries and paintings are also here, some of them actually
looking like they might be valuable. The tunnel leads back up into the main
section of the underground world. Though most of the walls look quite solid,
a part of the eastern area is covered with loose rubble, which appears to
have been just recently placed there.
