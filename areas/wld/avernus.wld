&+LThe Desolate Wasteland of Avernus&n~
&+LAvernus certainly looks like hell, with neither stars nor sun shining over
&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n

&+Lland structures.  The kobolds that live here seem to be fulfilling tasks given
&+Lto them by the baatezu natives.&n

&+LAvernus certainly looks like hell, with neither stars nor sun shining over
&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n

&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n

   &+rThe acrid, copper smell of frothing blood boils, bubbling&n
&+rinto fiery clots of foaming, congealed blood, with blackened&n
&+rstreaks of charred substance, riding upon the current within&n
&+rthe hideous landscape. Trapped reflections, undaunted by the&n
&+reffects of time or shifting molecules slide atop surfaces of&n
&+rthe infernal liquid, display scenes of rape, plunder and the&n
&+rsins of eons passed upon the brow of blackness and the crest&n

&+LAvernus certainly looks like hell, with neither stars nor sun shining over
&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n

&+rRiver of Blood&n~
   &+rThe acrid, copper smell of frothing blood boils, bubbling&n
&+rinto fiery clots of foaming, congealed blood, with blackened&n
&+rstreaks of charred substance, riding upon the current within&n
&+rthe hideous landscape. Trapped reflections, undaunted by the&n
&+reffects of time or shifting molecules slide atop surfaces of&n
&+rthe infernal liquid, display scenes of rape, plunder and the&n
&+rsins of eons passed upon the brow of blackness and the crest&n
&+rof malevolent intent.&n

&+LThe Desolate Wasteland of Avernus&n~
&+LAvernus certainly looks like hell, with neither stars nor sun shining over
&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n

&+rRiver of Blood&n~
   &+rThe acrid, copper smell of frothing blood boils, bubbling&n
&+rinto fiery clots of foaming, congealed blood, with blackened&n
&+rstreaks of charred substance, riding upon the current within&n
&+rthe hideous landscape. Trapped reflections, undaunted by the&n

&+rthe infernal liquid, display scenes of rape, plunder and the&n

&+LThe Desolate Wasteland of Avernus&n~
&+LAvernus certainly looks like hell, with neither stars nor sun shining over
&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n

&+rinto fiery clots of foaming, congealed blood, with blackened&n
&+rstreaks of charred substance, riding upon the current within&n
&+rthe hideous landscape. Trapped reflections, undaunted by the&n
&+reffects of time or shifting molecules slide atop surfaces of&n
&+rthe infernal liquid, display scenes of rape, plunder and the&n
&+rsins of eons passed upon the brow of blackness and the crest&n

&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n

&+LWhile the span and the peaks of the Stigmaris Mountains are not very

&+Lhere is different from that anywhere else on Avernus.  The rock seems to be

&+rLake of Blood&n~
   &+rThe acrid, copper smell of frothing blood boils, bubbling&n
&+rinto fiery clots of foaming, congealed blood, with blackened&n
&+rstreaks of charred substance, riding upon the current within&n
&+rthe hideous landscape. Trapped reflections, undaunted by the&n
&+reffects of time or shifting molecules slide atop surfaces of&n
&+rthe infernal liquid, display scenes of rape, plunder and the&n
&+rsins of eons passed upon the brow of blackness and the crest&n

&+yStigmaris Mountains&n~
&+LWhile the span and the peaks of the Stigmaris Mountains are not very
&+Limpressive, they still stick out upon the lanscape of Avernus.  The surface
&+Lhere is different from that anywhere else on Avernus.  The rock seems to be

&+Lthe mountain side seem to be oozing &+rblood&+L and other &+Rbodily &+Cfluids&+L.&n

&+LThe Desolate Wasteland of Avernus&n~
&+LAvernus certainly looks like hell, with neither stars nor sun shining over
&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n

&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n

&+LWhile the span and the peaks of the Stigmaris Mountains are not very

&+Lhere is different from that anywhere else on Avernus.  The rock seems to be

&+Lthe mountain side seem to be oozing &+rblood&+L and other &+Rbodily &+Cfluids&+L.&n

&+LThe Desolate Wasteland of Avernus&n~
&+LAvernus certainly looks like hell, with neither stars nor sun shining over
&+Lhead.  Instead, the entire plane is suffused with a &+rbloodred&+L light that never
&+Lwavers or dims.  The landscape is an endless wasteland of blasted, rock-strewn
&+Lfields, broken up with jagged mountains and treacherous foothills.  The
&+Lobsidian and quartz that protrudes from the earth could be beautiful in another
&+Lplace, but here only serve to cut and scrape the feet and legs of travelers.
&+LAvernus has no roads or buildings, save for the &+yBronze Citadel&+L, but many caves
&+Land warrens have been dug out of the rocks and poisonous vegetation; most are
&+Ldevils' homes, as unwary travelers seeking shelter will soon learn.&n
