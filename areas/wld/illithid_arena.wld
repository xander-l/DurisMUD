&+mCenter of the Arena&n~
The center of the &+Marena&N is dominated by the view of the huge stone
vat that contains the amorphous, &+MElder Brain&n.  Hard stone stretches
out into the arena in every direction.  A tall, conical plateu has been
erected in the center of this area, the steep slopes leading upward
at an angle barely climbable.

&+mNortheast Corner of the Arena&n~
A small depression in the ground contains runoff from the damp walls
in the northeastern corner of hte arena.  A slight trickle of water
can be heard.  The sound has a somewhat soothing affect in this place
of ritual violence.

&+mSoutheastern Corner of the Arena&n~
The arena comes to a sharp, angular corner here.  The line where
the southern, and eastern walls meet is jagged an uneven.

&+mWestern wall of the Arena&n~
To the east, the arena continues.  The historical combat plateau of the
illithids rises from the floor, up towards the &+MElder Brain&n.  A small
tunnel in the west wall can be made out.

&+mNorthwest Corner of the Arena&n~
The arena stretches out to the east and south from here. A bizarre
patchwork scuplture of hundreds of illithid heads forms the twisted,
rounded section that makes up the corner.

&+mSouthwest Corner of the Arena&n~
The southwestern corner of the arena is strangely cooler than the rest of
the arena.  The floor is rough, and a small outline or seam can be just
made out.  The arena strethces out to the north and east from here.

&+mPlateau&N~
The top of the plateau is approximately 15 feet across, with steep slopes
leading down into the floor level of the arena.  The awesome intellect
that is the &+MElder Brain&n lies above, creating an almost detectable
static of power in the air.

&+mA Dark Tunnel~
The tunnel is round and smooth, making footing difficult.  To the east
the cavern of the great arena opens up, while to the west the tunnel
continues into the darkness.

&+mPit Under the Arena&n~
This dark hole is void of features.  A stone slab looks as if it could
be wriggled into place above.  The ledge of the pet is just in reach,
and could be climbed out of.
