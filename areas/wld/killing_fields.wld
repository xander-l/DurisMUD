&+yRoad Through the Killing Fields&n~
   The road if it can be called that is covered in mud and made up of 10 foot
long beams of wood spaced horizontally one the ground approximately 5 inches
apart.  There are small trenches made from wagon wheels in the mud between

in the mud here.  A thick fog blankets the road, masking the horrors that
surround it on either side, accept for the occasional shrieks and groans from
the surrounding area all is quiet.  A road continues to the north through
the troll hills and this mud covered road leads south deeper into the killing
fields.

&+LThe Killing Fields&n~
   This large muddy expanse of ground is littered with bones, corpses,
dead trees, and large stones, giving it a very horrifying appearance.
Literally hundreds of humanoid tracks can be seen imprinted in the mud,
indicating that this area is frequented regularly.  A thick obscuring
fog blankets the field, hiding whatever horrors may be lurking about in
the shadows, though many shrieks and groans can be heard.  It is obvious
from the absolute carnage presented here, that many an unfortunate animal
or traveler has met their end in this field of death.

&+LThe Killing Fields&n~
   This large muddy expanse of ground is littered with bones, corpses,
dead trees, and large stones, giving it a very horrifying appearance.
Literally hundreds of humanoid tracks can be seen imprinted in the mud,
indicating that this area is frequented regularly.  A thick obscuring
fog blankets the field, hiding whatever horrors may be lurking about in
the shadows, though many shrieks and groans can be heard.  It is obvious
from the absolute carnage presented here, that many an unfortunate animal
or traveler has met their end in this field of death.

A Small Camp in the Killing Fields~
   This small camp has been setup on a small patch of hard dry clay surrounded
on all sides by muddy ground.  There is a small camp fire in the center that
has burned down to hot coals of wood and ash.  Only one pair of foot prints
can be seen here that appear human in shape and size.  The camp is quiet accept
for the many shrieks and groans that can be heard off in the distance.

&+yRoad Through the Killing Fields&n~
   The muddy wooden road makes its way through the killing fields.  There
are small trenches made from wagon wheels in the mud between the beams, a sure
sign of a well used road.  A thick fog blankets the road, masking the horrors
that surround it on either side, an accept for the occasional shrieks and
groans all is quiet.  The road continues to cut through the killing fields to
the east and west.

&+yRoad Through the Killing Fields&n~
   The road if it can be called that is covered in mud and made up of 10 foot
long beams of wood spaced approximately 5 inches apart.  There are small
trenches made from wagon wheels in the mud between the beams, a sure sign
of a well used road.  A thick fog blankets the road, masking the horrors that
surround it on either side, accept for the occasional shrieks and groans all
is quiet.  A road cuts through the bloody plains to the east and this road
continues to the west.

&+LThe Killing Fields&n~
   This large muddy expanse of ground is littered with bones, corpses,
dead trees, and large stones, giving it a very horrifying appearance.
Literally hundreds of humanoid tracks can be seen imprinted in the mud,
indicating that this area is frequented regularly.  A thick obscuring
fog blankets the field, hiding whatever horrors may be lurking about in
the shadows, though many shrieks and groans can be heard.  It is obvious
from the absolute carnage presented here, that many an unfortunate animal
or traveler has met their end in this field of death.

   This large muddy expanse of ground is littered with bones, corpses,
dead trees, and large stones, giving it a very horrifying appearance.
Literally hundreds of humanoid tracks can be seen imprinted in the mud,
indicating that this area is frequented regularly.  A thick obscuring
fog blankets the field, hiding whatever horrors may be lurking about in
the shadows, though many shrieks and groans can be heard.  It is obvious
from the absolute carnage presented here, that many an unfortunate animal
or traveler has met their end in this field of death.
