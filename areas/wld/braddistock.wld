&+LRoad leading to a Dark Mansion&n~
   To the north you can make out what looks like a huge mansion.
It's eerily quiet as you approach and the air seems thicker.  Darkness
starts to creep in, or is that just your imagination?

&+bEntrance Hall&n~
   The front door opens onto a musty, dirty entrance hall.
To your left a corridor leads into the west wing of the house.
On either side of the corridor opening the walls are bare but some
pieces of wood in the corner near the window indicate that a small
wooden table or chair once stood there.  Ahead of you, another
corridor leads towards the rear of the house.
   To your right a staircase climbs to the next story, reaching it at
a balcony which overlooks the hall along its north and west sides;
the stairs appear safe to climb though the balcony rail is broken
in several places.  Under the stairs at the rear of the hall a
third corridor leads east.  Glancing downwards you notice the ground
looks dusty in some areas, and clean in others.

   To the right of the sink a small, closed wooden cupboard is
fixed to the wall about 5' above floor level.

equally obviously it is now used for an entirely different purpose;
your first impression is that is it the living quarters for about ten
people.
   Ten single beds (crude affairs -- little more then thin mattresses on
boards) stand with heads to the south wall, each with a small wooden
locker at its foot.  In the center of the flagged floor is a long wooden
trestle table on which there is a variety of cheap metal cutlery and
earthenware crockery together with a large jug about half full of a light
brown liquid.  There are a dozen wooden stools around the table.

   A bench runs down the west wall of what was obviously a laboratory.
On the bench are various powders and liquids and several pieces of
chemical apparatus, some stained in different colors as the liquids they
contained dried up long ago.
   There is a table against the south wall, forming an L-shape with the bench.
 On the table is a candlestick, a tiny stump of
unlit candle remaining in it, and a variety of other items which,
even in the dim light, shine with the warmth of pure gold.  One of these
