&+cSmash Street~
  This street is covered with stones embedded into the ground. Large chunks of
rock and debris from the walls clutter the ground making it barely passable.
The debris seems to lessen to the north, as the road leads away from the
outer wall.  A large cloud of swamp gas blocks the sun entirely out. Along
the wall the street continues east and west.

  This section of pound road is bordered by wall to the east and buildings to
the west. There are large gaps in the stones that pave the street creating

see many buildings, most of which appear to have been multi-story at one time,
but the top floors now are just piles of rubble. The street is littered with
stone and debris. The air smells of decay and rot and insects swarm about.

can be seen to the north. The murky waters of a huge swamp can be seen south.

&+yAn Old Dead Park~
   This area appears to have been a park at one time but now is a trolls idea
of a playground. Dead tree trunks and tree limbs are scattered everywhere and
the ground its littered with the decayed corpses of small animals and
reptiles. The ground is trampled flat and devoid of plant life. Various sized
rocks lie about, some stacked as if they were building blocks. Stones that
have been chipped to create crude tools, and pieces of tree half carved into
clubs lie about. The park area itself is large surrounded by a stone
wall. The park continues north and west. The exit lies south.

&+bThe Guards Dining Room~
   This room is nothing but one huge round table surrounded by chairs. The
table itself is gouged and chipped where impatient Guards have waited for
food to arrive. Scraps of rotten food lie all over the floor and under the
table. The lovely aroma of decay and blood comes from the kitchen to the
north. Most appetizing.

was intentional, as the figures appear too new to have grown old and
crumbled. Banners that once covered the walls lie in shreds on the floor.
A huge, lush carpet that covered the floor at one time is also lying in

&+BThe Royal Statue Room~
   The hallway terminates at this point into a huge stone statue. The statue
is about 10 feet tall and finely crafted. It appears to be the minotaur
king that once laid claim to this palace. Wonder what happened to him?
There is a trapdoor leading down and the hall leaves to the west.

statue large minotaur king~
   This statue appears to be that of the minotaur king that once lived here. At
the base of the statue a name has been engraved in the stone, but its now
covered by a piece of animal hide with the word, 'MunChelf' written in blood.
The outer extremities, such as the horns, have been knocked off the statue to
make it appear more humanoid.  The blood is very faded, and may soon be
unable to be read.  It has been a long time since this 'MunChelf' was around
it seems.

&+BA Dim Hallway~
    This hallway is narrow and dimly lit. Banners that once covered the walls
lie about in shreds. The floor is muddy and the walls are chipped and cracking.
The only light is that which seeps in from the foyer.  There is a door in the
north wall and the hall continues east and west.

   This room appears to have once been a guest bedroom for royal visitors. A
huge bed is in the northwest corner, but is covered with stone chips and dust,
obviously not used in many years. Various other pieces of furniture lie broken
and dusty. You wonder why this room isn't used, its almost as if they don't want
anyone in this wing of the castle. A shiver runs down your spine. The exit is

the rubble that a mouse, much less a troll could squeeze through. The

A few skeletal corpses lie about, presumably of those that have tried for this

  This trail runs east west along the border of the ruins and the swamp. The
ground here slopes sharply to the north as the stone ruins disappear into the
muddy swamp. It is difficult to keep your balance on the slick mud surface of
the trial. The mud sucks at your feet and insects fill your mouth as you
breathe in the stagnant air. A road runs south from here. To the north is

  This centrally located spot is a favorite meeting place for the inhabitants
of Ghore.  The swamps can be accessed north and the ruins and various shops of
the town to the south.  The area is a crossroads with the trail running east
and west and another path leaving north.  There is a large statue of some
ancient troll guardian that has been erected and protects the area with a
magical force.  The statue has seen better days, however the major damage has
only occurred to the base of the statue.  A cloud of swamp gas covers the entire
swamp, blocking out any light from the sun.   A large stone lined pool of swamp
water is here for the trolls' drinking pleasure.

  This is a rather intricately carved statue of an ancient troll guardian.  The
artists depiction creates a more noble rendition of the standard troll, almost
giving a life to the piece of stone.  A faint aura surrounds the area around the
statue, and radiates outwards from it towards the edges of this area.  The magic
of the statue itself keeps it and others safe from physical harm.

   Thick vegetation and brush surround all the cleared areas of this dryland.
The path winds its way south, twisting and turning around the swamp like a
large snake. Huts have been placed in cleared areas at path-side. Two such
huts are both east and west of here. The trail runs north and south.

&+yA Trail Through the Bog~
   This trail runs west from here through the center of a huge bog. The smell
of the bog is overpowering. It is a smell of decay and troll excretment. Many
trolls can be seen about the bog, as it is the preferred place of residence for
many trolls. The bog looks big enough to handle hundreds of trolls easily. The
central path is east.

&+GAn Overgrown Patch of &+yMuddy Morass&N~
   &+yMud covers nearly all of the &+gvegetation &+ywithin this area, leaving
&+yonly the tallest reeds untouched.  A thick matting of plants lies flattened upon
&+ythe ground in the center of the area, perhaps as a resting place for some large
&+ycreature.  A &+Ldead and hollow tree &+ylies to the south, preventing anything from
&+ymoving in that direction.  There is a rather large pack of insects hovering in
&+ythe area, making a droning buzz that seems to reverberate about this morass.

&+GA Trolls Dwelling~
   This large tree had been hollowed out to create a home for some troll. Why a
troll would want to live in a tree is curious, maybe it was older, or less
adventurous than the rest. There is nothing in the room except for scraps of
rotting food and piles of troll crap. There are steps attached to the back wall
leading up to another room. The exit is south.

but the limbs are so thick and intertwined that it makes walking about possible.
The tops almost look like they were created with magic, but a close look shows
they are too irregular and the gaps down too big. The tree tops can be seen in
every direction. Better walk carefully.
