be coming from anything in particular, but more resemble a
small chunk of the Elemental Plane of Fire itself, that
somehow found its way here.

Great Worm Hole~
   The plane shifts and twists here into a massive funnel, rising
out of nowhere and disappearing into a cloud of mist.  Gravity is
a bit thicker around the neck of worm hole, drawing objects towards
it.  The cone is several miles in diameter, thinning out to a few
feet at its end.  It is rumored that such wormholes connect every
plane of existence to the Astral plane.

Yggdrasil, the World Ash~
   A mammoth oak tree rises out of a cloud of mist here, and
extends far beyond the range of sight.  The tree itself is
about two-hundred feet around, with great thick branches
that also disappear far off into the distance.  Yggdrasil
emanates an aura of great power, and glows faintly blue.  It
is rumored that this mighty tree touches every known plane
of existence, and is used by the gods themselves to travel
from one plane to another.

touches you, and a feeling of incredible peace and bliss
flows into your soul. Even though only the gods are powerful
enough to use this tree as a method of transport, you know it
to be a great landmark on the astral plane.
