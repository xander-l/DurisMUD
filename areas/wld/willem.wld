A Ruined City Street~
   The devastation extends for miles in each direction. Huge blocks of
stone are strewn about, the remains of the buildings that once lined this
street. All movement must be done slowly and carefully, lest a twisted
ankle result. Weeds have sprung up here and there, lending a slight bit of
color to a landscape that is otherwise entirely gray. This appears to have
once been a residential street.

&+yA Colossal Pair of Gates~
   A towering metal archway leads into a vast wasteland of ruined stone-
works. Once two enormous metallic gates hung from this arch, but in the many
years since this city stood, the gates rusted and fell to the earth, leaving
only the arch overhead as a memory of greatness. The gates lie off to one
side.
   Many tracks can be seen in the soft earth that leads underneath the
arch. It is obvious that more lead in, to the north, than lead south and
away from the desolation.

The gates are made of ancient copper, as evidenced by their greenish hue.
They are far too large and heavy for even an Ogre to drag very far. They
aren't going anywhere anytime soon (and there's no hollow underneath for
a carrion crawler to hide in!).

its neighbors, though... large blocks of granite, limestone, and sandstone
litter the street all the way to its center. There is no stretch of more

A Cul-de-sac along the Ruins of a Residential Road~
   The road comes to an abrupt halt here, widening briefly into a
circular shape, then closing off. The houses surrounding the cul-de-sac
look to once have belonged to the affluent of this dead city, but the
years have reduced them to the same state as all the other buildings.
Only one appears to have survived the decay to any extent, to the north-

complete buildings to the north- or at least their tops. As for the rest of
the interior, the southern half of the building seems to have fared well:
besides the door leading back to the street, which has been torn from its
hinges, there are few cracks in the southern wall and much of the floor is
relatively free of dust and debris.

competing trees, shrubs, and weeds. This place does, however, look like a
park might be expected to look if left untended for a century or two. At
least the surroundings are drunk with life, and not death, as is the case
in the city proper.
   The park is bounded by a short, crumbling wall of red brick on the
south, but paths through the vegetation can be taken in any other direction.

&+gA &+BFountain &+gin a Public Park~
   This is the far corner of the park. The ancient wall of brick that
marks its boundaries cuts off travel to the east and south. However, this
corner is markedly different from the rest of the park in that it appears
to have been cared for somewhat. While each plant seems to have been given
all the space it needed to grow, there is something of a clearing around
a bubbling marble fountain. Based on the spoor that surrounds this area,
this would appear to be the center of animal activity in the park as well.

&+gA Druid's Home~
   &+gThe upper branches of this tree have been meticulously crafted to
&+gform a number of places to sit, lie down, and climb higher and lower. From
&+gthe items lying about it is apparent that the tree's resident is a druid of
&+ggreat power: holy symbols, charts and diagrams written on tree bark, and a
&+gsmall shrine butting up against the main trunk. Unfortunately the foliage
&+gis too thick to be able to see out of the park in any direction.

   Darkness fills the space between the ancient stone walls of this
building. Though it has survived well, there is the usual rubble and
debris strewn about the floor. Along the east wall there is a long counter
which has long been clear of any items that might give a hint as to this
building's use. Along the south wall is a large staircase that leads to
the ruined upper stories. The cast-iron railings of the staircase sport a
repeating pattern of four interlocking diamonds.

&+cStanding Atop a Ruined Building~
   That the staircase leading up to this place was still usable is a
near-miracle. It was too much to ask that the second floor of this
building be in good condition. The walls have all crumbled away, and were
it not for the inlaid tile floor one might think that this was the
original roof of the building.
   From this vantage point one can easily see a series of five statues
somewhat to the north. In addition, the palace-like structure with three
spires farther to the northeast can be made out more clearly. As odd as it
is that such a building survived while all around it was destroyed, the
many windows appear to be in perfect condition, and the walls of the palace
are free of ivy.

   Decades of disuse have not been enough to disperse the awful smell
that emanates from this building. It is *extremely* apparent that this was
some sort of flophouse- piles of mostly-decayed hay are scattered about,
organized into rows, and there is a short counter by the door. There are
small deposits, here and there, of substances better left unnamed.
   In one corner the floor has fallen away, making this room somewhat
dangerous. The unfortunate who fell through that hole might not be able

   Whatever force destroyed this city was funneled through the windows
on the northern side of this building. The other three walls are in fairly

many upturned tables and bits of glassware and crockery that litter the
floor. A long low bar on the western wall has stains from end to end-
probably from liquor that spilled during the holocaust that devastated
this city. From this vantage point, what lies behind the bar is obscured

remained intact while doing so. From this alley it would be possible to
climb into what used to be the second story through the window.

buildings. From the amount of rubble in the street, indicating buildings of

&+mThrough a Strange Field~
   It is here that a most wondrous transformation takes place. It is as if
the gods had drawn a stark line across the city, before raining destruction
upon it. To the south of this line of demarcation lie the familiar ruins.
North of it, however, all is in perfect condition. A magnificent palace
reaches into the sky with three great spires; the palace is surrounded by
a series of well-tended gardens and several outbuildings.
   There is a barely audible humming sound that is the only indication of
the vast powers at work here.

Along a Ruined Street~
   The devastation extends for miles in each direction. Huge blocks of
stone are strewn about, the remains of the buildings that once lined this
street. All movement must be done slowly and carefully, lest a twisted
ankle result. Weeds have sprung up here and there, lending a slight bit of
color to a landscape that is otherwise entirely gray. This appears to have
once been a residential street.
   Travel further east is impossible due to the collapse of a three-story
hostelry directly across the road. To the north lies one of the odd
buildings that has more or less retained its shape over the years; the
building looks oddly menacing, though there's nothing in particular about
it that might give that impression.

A Field of Debris~
   There is no way that this can be called a street any longer. Although
one can dimly make out the cobbles far underneath, the destruction
appears to grow the farther north one travels. Here, near the northern
edge of the city, the rubble can no longer be identified as former
sections of buildings, and the boundary between house and avenue is
invisible.
   A large gap between two huge blocks of granite leads down into dark-
ness. The climb down into the gap looks quite treacherous, and the climb
up virtually impossible.

&+LA Sudden Change in the Sewers~
   &+LThe flagstone tiling that forms the walls of the sewers to the east is
&+Ltorn up here, and the relatively ordered passageway rapidly degenerates
&+Linto a rough-hewn cavern to the west. Whatever did this wields fearsome
&+Lpower. Perhaps further exploration to the west is inadvisable.

&+rNorth End &+Lof the &+rDining Hall~
   &+rThis room reaches over a hundred feet to the south, and is almost half
&+rthat in width. A series of four chandeliers hang high above the dining
&+rtable, which looks as though it could seat an entire army. A balcony runs
&+rfar above the scene, and more tapestries cover the walls. Strangely enough,
&+rthe table is set with some fairly lavish china, and there are several roasts
&+rplaced at intervals in the center of the table! Despite the readiness of
&+rthe meal, there is nobody seated at any of the places.

&+rsingle shade of deepest red. Several torches keep the room brightly lit.

&+rThe Kitchen~
   This room is refreshing, in that it is not filled with the blood-red
color that can be found almost everywhere else in the palace. It looks
likea well-stocked kitchen ought to look: two fireplaces, a large oven
constructed of iron, a long counter, and numerous shelves and cabinets.
As in the dining-hall, things seem to be frozen in a sort of stasis: the
fires roar without consuming any fuel, and food lies out on the table,
unattended.
   Hidden in the back is a small staircase that leads down into darkness.

the door provides the room's only illumination.
