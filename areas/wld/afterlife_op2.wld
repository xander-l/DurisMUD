&+CThis is a massive cavern under the frozen tundra that leads into a&N
&+Cwell lit tunnel. The cavern itself is extremely large, with large icy&N
&+Cstalagtites and stalagmites strewn about the cavern. An eerie white&N
&+Cglow emanates down the corridor, which reflects off of whisps of snow&N
&+Cand frost in the air, illuminating the cavern with a bunch of dancing&N
&+Clights. Four stoic frost golems stand vigil further down the corridor,&N
&+Cpreventing unwanted visitors from trespassing.&N

&+CThe massive cavern leads to this tunnel, which is coated in a thin layer&N

&+Cthe cavern reflects off of the ice, illuminating the entire tunnel in&N

&+CThe tunnel leads to this small room beneath the tundra. In the center&N
&+Cof the room is a large portal, which has a mirror like surface. The&N
&+Cportal is framed with thick ice, and encrusted in frost. The ice has&N
&+Can inner glow, and upon closer inspection, magical runes can be seen&N
&+Cswirling around just under the surface. An inscription on the wall&N
&+Creads, "This is the portal to &+cKhomani&+W-&+cKhan&+C".&N

&+GA small incline from the main path leads to this mysterious ring of&N
&+Gtrees. Apparently in the middle of nowhere, its hard to imagine how such&N
&+Gstrong, sturdy oak trees could thrive where no other life could live.&N
&+GA thin layer of fog snakes along the floor of the forest here. To the&N
&+Gnorth a small path can be seen that leads deeper into the mysterious&N
&+Gforest ahead.&N

&+GThe stone path continues deeper into the woods. The dark trees loom&N
&+Goverhead, and the fog seems to get thicker the further you travel on&N
&+Gthe path. Strangely, there are no sounds from the forest, just the&N
&+Gsounds of your feet traveling on the stone echo'ing throughout the&N
&+Gtrees. A faint glowing can be seen coming from the west as the path&N
&+Gcontinues in that direction.&N

&+Garound you there is nothing but trees. The stone of the portal has&N
&+Gengraved magical runes which also glow and pulse in time with the light&N

&+m    Dozens of skeletons and various other undeads have gathered
&+maround this circle. All of them gazing into the passage that
&+mlie within. None dare step foot within unless they were living.
&+mFoul creatures fly overhead, emitting a high pitched screeching
&+mnoise. A stench of rancid flesh and decay permeates the air.
&+mThe large rocks of salt here have been carefully placed as to
&+mensure the residency inside.

&+c    Here the air grows calmer, though there is a slight underground
&+cbreeze blowing. Bat nests can be seen along the lining of the ceiling.
&+cThe ground is moist but gritty and holds firm to the step. To the west
&+clies more eerie darkness.
