&+yA Precarious Walkway Between the Rocks&N~
&+yThis opening between the rocks appears to have been formed by some natural
&+ydisater, such as an immense &+Blightning strike&+y, or perhaps a small &+Wavalanche&+y
&+ythat cracked the rock face.  The jagged edges of the walls are bright with
&+ysedimentary layers, giving a colorful picture of the geology of the mountain.
&+yThe trail is covered by loose rock and sharp angles, making mounted travel
&+yimpossible, although a sure-footed adventurer might be able to navigate the
&+ycrevice.  To the south lies the plains.&N

&+yTravelling further down this crevice, the walls narrow slightly, making
&+ytravel slightly more dangerous.  Loose stones skitter underfoot, causing
&+yfooting to be unsteady.  The crack continues in a relatively straight line

&+LA Small Open Area in the Mountains&N~
This area appears to be inhabited.  A layer of dirty straw has been scattered
about, providing somewhat comfortable footing.  The air is rich with the
smell of smoke, animals, dung, and unwashed bodies.  The area walls are
slightly discolored with the stains of wood smoke and dirt.  Various small
camping implements are scattered about in differing states of disrepair.

&+mA Small Corral Set in the Wall of the Mountain&N~
This niche appears to have been carved directly from the mountainside.  A
small fence prevents the animals caged within from escaping into the living
area of the group.  The ground is a vile mixture of dung, rotting scraps of
food, bits of cloth, and decomposing bodies.
