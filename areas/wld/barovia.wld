&+LA Road Before the Svalich Woods&N~
   &+LThis road picks up here leading north into the Svalich woods.
&+LThe dark forest that lies ahead seemingly sucks out the light,
&+Lpreventing any small plant growth other than the foreboding,
&+Land cryptic leafless trees of the woods themselves.  A dense
&+Lfog blankets the surrounding area giving an aura of blackness
&+Land dreary twilight.

&+Lthese streets and roads.  Random buildings, including homes as well as
&+Lstores are located along these streets.  The only thing they have in

&+cThe Town Square of Barovia&N~
   &+cThis town square is marked with a grandiose &+Cstatue&+c of a prominent
&+cnobleman.  The nobleman wears a highly-collared vestment, hand on the
&+chilt of his sheathed rapier in a stance and posture demonstrating pride
&+cand strength.  A small insignia, scrolled upon the base of the statue
&+cof the nobleman are the words '&NCount Strahd von Zarovich&+c' in a common
&+clanguage to this region.  The long, groomed hair of this nobleman has
&+cbeen interpretated by the artisan of this statue in a long, flowing
&+cponytail, resting comfortably on his back in the same fashion a lion's
&+cmane would rest upon it's strong back.  This open area has many of the
&+csurrounding buildings face inward towards it.  The town crier of this
&+cvillage, although currently not present, would most likely shout warnings
&+cand messages to the townspeople, as seen fit by the lord of this realm.

&+CThe Village Well of Barovia&N~
   &+CA few small stone steps lead down into a small grassy
&+Ccourtyard, encircled by a small wooden fence.  The courtyard
&+Cis centered by a small, roofed stone well equipped with a
&+Crotissery-style mechanism used to lower and raise buckets
&+Cinto the water below.  Leaves in the everypresent autumn
&+Cfall of Barovia are scattered about the area, and fill the
&+Cotherwise empty and somewhat slimy wooden bucket that
&+Crests in a heap of rope on the leafy and overgrown grass
&+Cof the courtyard.

&+LHis shop, once entirely the home of him and his family, houses the

&+Lparts of Barovia.  A wild look fills his aging eyes, yet still fiery
&+Lwith magic, perhaps granting him a longer life than he would of normally

   &+LInside the gates, here, one can see the great wilderness
&+Lof the Valley of Barovia north of here.  The realm of Barovia
&+Lcarries with it many fearsome &+ywerewolves&+L and an angry forest.
&+LBeyond these gates, one can see the hillside of the Valley
&+Lrise and rise north in the distance, eventually finding the
&+Lgreat &+gLysaga Hill&+L and finally Castle &+rRavenloft&+L.  To the
&+Lwest, the foul gasses of &+mIvlis Marsh&+L rise like purple and black
&+Lsmoke into the horizon.  South of here, back into the &+cVillage&+L of
&+LBarovia, resting at the heart of the Svalich Woods in the lowest part
&+Lof the Valley, the &+gzombie &+Lincursion appears to have been
&+Lquelled for now.  Thee &+yfootprints&+L of a &+Chuman&+L &+Lare pushed
