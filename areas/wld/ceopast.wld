   The forest here rises high into the sky, with its
think canopy blocking out the sun.  A few stray beams of
light do little to light the forest, instead creating a
rather eerie feel.  The think undergrowth makes movement
rather difficult, and any travel through it is slow and
rigorous.  The sounds of wild life can be heard running
through the thick scrub, whilst they try and avoid their
pursuers.  The sounds of birds can be heard all around,
and in the distance the baying of a wolf pack echo
through the woods.

&+yA Fenced&n &+gHerb Garden&n~
   A small fence has been erected around this herb
garden.  The fence does little more than create a wind
block, standing only two foot in height.  The herbs
have been planted in careful rows, and the ground has
been kept weed free.  Surrounded on all sides by the
forest, this garden seems to be well loved.  To the
east is a small shack, which is starting to show the
signs of age.

&+cA Small Sitting Room&n &+yWithin a Run Down Shack&n~
   This sparsely decorated room is purely practical.  Two
chairs rest in front of a small fireplace, and a little
table bares an open book upon it.  The fire burns low,
providing enough heat to warm the room, its rock
construction holding the heat well after the fire has
died, further heating the small shack.

&+BA Small Bedroom&n &+yWithin a Run Down Shack&n~
   This small room contains a rather uncomfortable
looking bed, covered in patched furs.  A small chest
stands at the base of the bed, open and containing
some clothing.  A small washstand is the only other
piece of furniture in the room, made from gathered
timbers, it also contains a small mirror.  The wooden
floor creaks under pressure, and looks as though it
may give way under any great weight.

&+gA Dense and&n &+LDark&n &+gForest&n~
   The forest here is showing minor signs of thinning,
letting in a little more light than its deeper parts.
Even though the light has increased slightly it is still
a dark and densely treed area.  Skirting the fringes of
a thinner forest, small glances of what appears to be
farmland can be seen.  The population of which cannot be
determined from this vantage point.

   The forest here rises high into the sky, with its
think canopy blocking out the sun.  A few stray beams of
light do little to light the forest, instead creating a
rather eerie feel.  The think undergrowth makes movement
rather difficult, and any travel through it is slow and
rigorous.  The sounds of wild life can be heard running
through the thick scrub, whilst they try and avoid their
pursuers.  The sounds of birds can be heard all around,
and in the distance the baying of a wolf pack echo
through the woods.

&+gA Thinning Forest&n~
   The forest starts to thin here, and is largely due to
the fact that its woods have been used to construct the
surrounding farms, and also to provide heat for the local
families.  Leading deeper into the area the forest
thickens considerably, to the point of blocking out the
sun.  The resulting darkness, is the perfect cover for
the animals of the region.  The forest also boarders the
farming land, and the buildings, providing some shelter
from the winds and weather.

rather difficult, and any travel through it is slow and

all seem quiet content with their surrounds.  Light

&+yThe Entrance to a Small Barn&n~
   A large door swings easily on its hinges, and opens
up into a small barn.  Used to house the work animals,
and to store various tools, it is a fairly simple
structure.  Opening onto the field, and housing a small
coralle, it is no different from most barns.  Rising up
above the ground is a hayloft, stocked with serveral
bails.  Beams of sun can be seen shining through gaps in
the walls, providing enough illumination to work by.

&+gA Small&n &+GVegetable&n &+gPatch&n~
   This small garden has been set up the grow a vegetables
for the farmers family.  Carefully measured rows of produce
are in full growth, providing more than enough food.
Situated between two double story buildings, the patch is
sheltered from the harsher of natures elements.  The fresh
green growth looks especially inviting, yet the immature
vegetables are sure to turn the stomach.

are prepared.  A Large bench is covered with various
vegetables, yet to be cut, and a small haunch of meat

and a pot of water being boiled rests upon it.  A small
rack above the bench holds various cooking utensils, as
well as a few dried herbs.

&+gA Thinning Forest&n~
   The forest starts to thin here, and is largely due to
the fact that its woods have been used to construct the
surrounding farms, and also to provide heat for the local
families.  Leading deeper into the area the forest
thickens considerably, to the point of blocking out the
sun.  The resulting darkness, is the perfect cover for
the animals of the region.  The forest also boarders the
farming land, and the buildings, providing some shelter
from the winds and weather.

   The forest here rises high into the sky, with its
think canopy blocking out the sun.  A few stray beams of
light do little to light the forest, instead creating a
rather eerie feel.  The think undergrowth makes movement
rather difficult, and any travel through it is slow and
rigorous.  The sounds of wild life can be heard running
through the thick scrub, whilst they try and avoid their
pursuers.  The sounds of birds can be heard all around,
and in the distance the baying of a wolf pack echo
through the woods.

&+yA Small Field of&n &+YWheat&n~
   Swaying gently in the breeze, this field of wheat
provides for the farmer's families, as well as
providing some nourishment for the of the work animals.
The field has been carved from the surrounding forest,
and stands in stark contrast to the more common landscape.
Toward the south-west a steep rise of bluestone can be
seen, affording a rather plesant view.  Small birds can be
seen weaving their way through the field, pecking at the
fallen grains of wheat along the ground.  A small barn and
farmhouse sit alongside the field, the barn being where
the grain is stored during the winter months.

   The forest starts to thin here, and is largely due to
the fact that its woods have been used to construct the
surrounding farms, and also to provide heat for the local
families.  Leading deeper into the area the forest
thickens considerably, to the point of blocking out the
sun.  The resulting darkness, is the perfect cover for
the animals of the region.  The forest also boarders the
farming land, and the buildings, providing some shelter
from the winds and weather.

Even though the light has increased slightly it is still

&+yA Small Field of&n &+YWheat&n~
   Swaying gently in the breeze, this field of wheat
provides for the farmer's families, as well as
providing some nourishment for the of the work animals.
The field has been carved from the surrounding forest,
and stands in stark contrast to the more common landscape.
Toward the south-west a steep rise of bluestone can be
seen, affording a rather plesant view.  Small birds can be
seen weaving their way through the field, pecking at the
fallen grains of wheat along the ground.  A small barn and
farmhouse sit alongside the field, the barn being where
the grain is stored during the winter months.

&+LA Worn Dirt Trail&n &+gThrough a Thinning Forest&n~
   Winding through the forest is a fairly well used
dirt trail.  Used to connect the two farms to the main
water source, it is a route traveled daily by the
farms occupants.  The forest on either side of the road
is quite serene, providing wood and shelter to the
inhabitants of the region.  The sun shines through to
the ground, and often one can see the wildlife darting
in and out of the thicker forest behind.  The ground is
covered in a thick grass, and scattered with the dead
leaves of the trees above.

&+bA Small Pool of Water&n &+gon a Forest Trail&n~
   Bubbling up from the ground here is a small stream.
It seems to surge up from the ground only to fall back
into itself, providing a constantly fresh, albeit
unusual, water source.  A small dirt trail leads away
from it and back into the forest.  The water catches
the suns light on its surface, creating a sparkling
look, as it reflects the light into the forest.

houses the farms work animals.  The small stalls are
filled with fresh hay, and a small food and water
tray rests towards the front of the stall.  The barn
offers the animals protection from the weather, and
all seem quiet content with their surrounds.  Light
shines through the barn walls illuminating the coralle
so that no additional light source is needed.

area is used to graze sheep and livestock.  The thick
green grass is lush, and sways in the gently blowing
breeze.  The field is lined by the forest from which
it was cut, providing shade to the animals and allowing
them total freedom.  No fence lines the field, as past
the thinning forest the dense undergrowth makes movement
difficult, even for the bigger livestock.  Situated on
the field is a small barn, and a farmhouse, which also
seem to be a popular resting place for the animals.

&+gA Thinning Forest&n~
   The forest starts to thin here, and is largely due to
the fact that its woods have been used to construct the
surrounding farms, and also to provide heat for the local
families.  Leading deeper into the area the forest
thickens considerably, to the point of blocking out the
sun.  The resulting darkness, is the perfect cover for
the animals of the region.  The forest also boarders the
farming land, and the buildings, providing some shelter
from the winds and weather.

&+LA Worn Dirt Trail&n &+gThrough a Thinning Forest&n~
   Winding through the forest is a fairly well used
dirt trail.  Used to connect the two farms to the main
water source, it is a route traveled daily by the
farms occupants.  The forest on either side of the road
is quite serene, providing wood and shelter to the
inhabitants of the region.  The sun shines through to
the ground, and often one can see the wildlife darting
in and out of the thicker forest behind.  The ground is
covered in a thick grass, and scattered with the dead
leaves of the trees above.

&+yThe Entrance to a Small Barn&n~
   A large door swings easily on its hinges, and opens
up into a small barn.  Used to house the work animals,
and to store various tools, it is a fairly simple
structure.  Opening onto the field, and housing a small
coralle, it is no different from most barns.  Rising up
above the ground is a hayloft, stocked with serveral
bails.  Beams of sun can be seen shining through gaps in
the walls, providing enough illumination to work by.

   Cut from the surrounding forest, this small grassy
area is used to graze sheep and livestock.  The thick
green grass is lush, and sways in the gently blowing

them total freedom.  No fence lines the field, as past
the thinning forest the dense undergrowth makes movement
difficult, even for the bigger livestock.  Situated on
the field is a small barn, and a farmhouse, which also
seem to be a popular resting place for the animals.

   The forest here is showing minor signs of thinning,
letting in a little more light than its deeper parts.
Even though the light has increased slightly it is still
a dark and densely treed area.  Skirting the fringes of
a thinner forest, small glances of what appears to be
farmland can be seen.  The population of which cannot be
determined from this vantage point.

&+wA Steep&n &+bBlu&+Besto&+bne&n &+wRise&n~
   Rising out of the forest this steep rise, is made
completely of bluestone.  Below the forest can be seen
giving away to its dull surface, as all the topsoil is
long gone, a victim of the elements.  The surface of
the stone is suprisingly smooth, making handholds rare
and precarious.  The suface of the stone, almost
captures the light of the sun and absorbs it, giving
off little reflection, and creating shadows within the
outcrops of stone.

The once dense forest is reduced to a few hardy trees,
which cling to the precious top soil, often at rather
precarious angles.  The deep blue of the stone can be
clearly seen in places where the elements have removed
all traces of the earth.  The steep rise can be seen
jutting out over the forest canopy, most likely affording
an unparalled view of the surrounding area.

   Swaying gently in the breeze, this field of wheat
provides for the farmer's families, as well as
providing some nourishment for the of the work animals.
The field has been carved from the surrounding forest,
and stands in stark contrast to the more common landscape.
Toward the south-west a steep rise of bluestone can be
seen, affording a rather plesant view.  Small birds can be
seen weaving their way through the field, pecking at the
fallen grains of wheat along the ground.  A small barn and
farmhouse sit alongside the field, the barn being where
the grain is stored during the winter months.

the thinning forest the dense undergrowth makes movement
difficult, even for the bigger livestock.  Situated on
the field is a small barn, and a farmhouse, which also
seem to be a popular resting place for the animals.

&+gA Thinning Forest&n~
   The forest starts to thin here, and is largely due to
the fact that its woods have been used to construct the
surrounding farms, and also to provide heat for the local
families.  Leading deeper into the area the forest
thickens considerably, to the point of blocking out the
sun.  The resulting darkness, is the perfect cover for
the animals of the region.  The forest also boarders the
farming land, and the buildings, providing some shelter
from the winds and weather.

Even though the light has increased slightly it is still
a dark and densely treed area.  Skirting the fringes of

   The dense forest gives way here, to a bluestone rise.
The once dense forest is reduced to a few hardy trees,
which cling to the precious top soil, often at rather
precarious angles.  The deep blue of the stone can be
clearly seen in places where the elements have removed
all traces of the earth.  The steep rise can be seen
jutting out over the forest canopy, most likely affording

&+yA Small Field of&n &+YWheat&n~
   Swaying gently in the breeze, this field of wheat
provides for the farmer's families, as well as
providing some nourishment for the of the work animals.
The field has been carved from the surrounding forest,
and stands in stark contrast to the more common landscape.
Toward the south-west a steep rise of bluestone can be
seen, affording a rather plesant view.  Small birds can be
seen weaving their way through the field, pecking at the
fallen grains of wheat along the ground.  A small barn and
farmhouse sit alongside the field, the barn being where
the grain is stored during the winter months.

   Clustered together are some apple trees, not yet in

The trees stand against a back drop of the forest, and
are none to immpressive when compared in size.  Small
shoots can been seen coming up from the ground as the
newer trees begin to grow, seeds most likely from pilaged
fruit, the local birds endulged in.

   Used by the farmers to relax in, this room is fairly
extravagent, by the farmers standards.  An open fire
places keeps the room warm, and a small pile of wood
ensures that there is enough fuel for the night.  A large
rug covers the wooden floor, upon which rest so padded
chairs.  A small shelf sits above the fire place, holding
a few precious books.  A small table rests beside one of
the chairs, resting on it, a small pouch and a tabaco pipe.

&+gA Thinning Forest&n~
   The forest starts to thin here, and is largely due to
the fact that its woods have been used to construct the
surrounding farms, and also to provide heat for the local
families.  Leading deeper into the area the forest
thickens considerably, to the point of blocking out the

   The forest here is showing minor signs of thinning,
letting in a little more light than its deeper parts.
Even though the light has increased slightly it is still
a dark and densely treed area.  Skirting the fringes of

farmland can be seen.  The population of which cannot be

&+cA Small Dining Area&n &+yWithin a Farmhouse&n~
   This relatively plain room contains a small table and
chairs, used by the farmers at meal time.  A small shelf
against the wall holds some crockery and eating utensils.
A rug covers the floor, providing a little luxuary.
Joining the dining area is a kitchen and a living room.
A lantern is suspended from the roof providing light to
eat by, used during the evening meals.

   This well used kitchen is where the farmers meals
are prepared.  A Large bench is covered with various
vegetables, yet to be cut, and a small haunch of meat
which is being seasoned, rest in a tray.  A wood
burning stove has been set in the corner of the room,
and a pot of water being boiled rests upon it.  A small
rack above the bench holds various cooking utensils, as
well as a few dried herbs.

&+gA Field of Lush&n &+GGreen&n &+gGrass&n~
   Cut from the surrounding forest, this small grassy
area is used to graze sheep and livestock.  The thick
green grass is lush, and sways in the gently blowing
breeze.  The field is lined by the forest from which
it was cut, providing shade to the animals and allowing
them total freedom.  No fence lines the field, as past
the thinning forest the dense undergrowth makes movement
difficult, even for the bigger livestock.  Situated on
the field is a small barn, and a farmhouse, which also
seem to be a popular resting place for the animals.

&+gA Scraggy Forest at the Start of a&n &+bBlu&+Besto&+bne&n &+wRise&n~
   The dense forest gives way here, to a bluestone rise.
The once dense forest is reduced to a few hardy trees,
which cling to the precious top soil, often at rather
precarious angles.  The deep blue of the stone can be
clearly seen in places where the elements have removed
all traces of the earth.  The steep rise can be seen
jutting out over the forest canopy, most likely affording
an unparalled view of the surrounding area.

&+wA Steep&n &+bBlu&+Besto&+bne&n &+wRise&n~
   Rising high above the forest floor this small plateau
gives an unparalled view of the surrounds.  To the
north-east two small farms can be seen, thier fields
carved from the forest, and the thatched roofs of the
buildings hiding that within.  To the south the rise
decends, giving way once more to the thick forest that
surrounds it.  The plateau itself rises at a slight
incline, forming a tiny peak, before once again sloping
down into the forest floor.

&+wA Steep&n &+bBlu&+Besto&+bne&n &+wRise&n~
   Rising out of the forest this steep rise, is made
completely of bluestone.  Below the forest can be seen
giving away to its dull surface, as all the topsoil is
long gone, a victim of the elements.  The surface of
the stone is suprisingly smooth, making handholds rare
and precarious.  The suface of the stone, almost
captures the light of the sun and absorbs it, giving
off little reflection, and creating shadows within the
outcrops of stone.

&+gA Scraggy Forest at the Start of a&n &+bBlu&+Besto&+bne&n &+wRise&n~
   The dense forest gives way here, to a bluestone rise.
The once dense forest is reduced to a few hardy trees,
which cling to the precious top soil, often at rather
precarious angles.  The deep blue of the stone can be
clearly seen in places where the elements have removed
all traces of the earth.  The steep rise can be seen
jutting out over the forest canopy, most likely affording
an unparalled view of the surrounding area.

   The forest here rises high into the sky, with its
think canopy blocking out the sun.  A few stray beams of
light do little to light the forest, instead creating a
rather eerie feel.  The think undergrowth makes movement
rather difficult, and any travel through it is slow and
rigorous.  The sounds of wild life can be heard running
through the thick scrub, whilst they try and avoid their
pursuers.  The sounds of birds can be heard all around,
and in the distance the baying of a wolf pack echo
through the woods.

&+gA Dense and&n &+LDark&n &+gForest&n~
   The forest here rises high into the sky, with its
think canopy blocking out the sun.  A few stray beams of
light do little to light the forest, instead creating a
rather eerie feel.  The think undergrowth makes movement
rather difficult, and any travel through it is slow and
rigorous.  The sounds of wild life can be heard running
through the thick scrub, whilst they try and avoid their
pursuers.  The sounds of birds can be heard all around,
and in the distance the baying of a wolf pack echo
through the woods.

&+wThe Entrance to a&n &+bBlu&+Besto&+bne&n &+wCave&n~
   Leading down from the bluestone rise, this cave
entrance appears to lead deeper into the rise itself.
Little light drifts down from the cave opening, which
is well shielded both in the angle of the opening, and
from the sloping side of the rise.  The walls and floor
of the cave have been worn smooth, where as the ceiling
still maintains a jagged and rough hue.

   This small tunnel connects the entrance of the cave,
to a large cavern carved from the bluestone itself.  A
massive boulder covers the entrance to the cavern,
protecting what is not certain.  A stiff smell emenates
from with in the cavern, as well as a potent burning aroma.

   This large cavern has been blasted from the center
of the bluestone rise.  Each surface of the cavern has
been worn smooth as if some great heat melted the very

around the cavern, casting an eerie twilight to
illuminate it.  The ceiling of the cavern rises some
forty feet up, and is barely visable in the light.

   A simple hallway runs along outside the bedrooms of
the farmhouse.  A small wooden stairs connects the two

worn perfectly smooth.  Two bedrooms lead off from the
hall, each housing the family of the farmers.
