&+LBefore the East Gates of BogenTok&n~
&+L   These appear to be the gates of BogenTok, one of the common
&+Lcities in the Underdark, run primarily by figure heads of the
&+Lkey races in the Underdark.  The gates themselves are pretty
&+Lmuch non-descript, being forged out of adamntite in the local
&+LKhildarak forges.  All races seem to enjoy their stay here in
&+LBogenTok, as the women are good, the beer is plentiful, and
&+Lsongs of the great good race destruction fill the air.

&+RTitanor Street&n~
    This street seems to have been named after one of the founding
fathers of BogenTok, and that is Titanor, a fabled hero in ogre
mythology.  Titanor, who no one ever sees, lives in probably one of
the noble houses in the northern residential district, and probably
helps conduct army training in the southern military district.  The
road itself is very simple, nothing but large cobblestones, about
five or six feet wide placed together tightly.

The Great Intersection of Titanor Street and Tvlar Way~
&+L   Titanor and Tvlar street intersect here at a fairly common
&+Lstomping grounds.  The main troop movements lie to the south
&+Ltowards the training grounds, while the upper and middle class
&+Lresidential areas and general commerce districts lie to the
&+Lnorth.  Just before the training grounds is the great market
&+Lplace which lies to the distance in the south. While Tvlar runs
&+Lin a north-south direction, Titanor runs east to west.

&+cThe Great Fountain of BogenTok&n~
    This appears to be the central watering hole for the entire city.
The fountain fills almost the entire room, and soars into the sky at
least twenty feat, with aproximately 6 different waterfalls going
on at once.  At almost any hour of the day someone is taking a drink
from the cool refreshing fountain, or carrying a couple buckets
home to the crowded lower class appartments. The Strangled Paladins
Inn lies off to the east, while the public execution block lies to
the east by ways of a small mud road.

&+mThe Community WhoreHouse&n~
    The one thing that attracts many travellers of the Underdark to
BogenTok is their many whore houses throughout the city.  This
particular house is the most commonly used, being so close to the
Inn and also being near the center of town.  The whore house is
much like any other whore house, with a common gathering area and
several private rooms surrounding the common meeting place. To the
north, south, and west of here lie the private rooms, while the
head whore's office is up the stairs.

    This inn seems to have gotten its name from the evil practice
of bringing back mortally wounded paladins from battle, and torturing
them on display at the inn.  This inn is particularily large for many
of the inn's in the realm, with both a bar, a lounge, and the reception
area.  The entrayway to the inn is very non-descript except for small
figurines depiciting small racewar battles.

travellers come to get some of the stout beer imorted from Khildarak,
and every so often, some of the fine drow elven wines that are
imported from Arachdrathos.  The entire area is very dim, with only
faint glows to help the non-ultravision seeing races see. A set of
stairs leads up into the main receptionist area, while the entrance
to the inn lies to the east.

lead off in all directions where guests are lead.  Each hallway contains
a series of different sized room in accordance with the size of the
person renting the room.  The rooms range from small to medium to large.
There is also a central kitchen and wash room which guests are
permitted to use when checking in and out, as well as three times
per day.  To the east, lies a quiet lounge, mostly inhabitted by
plotting rogues, and scheming assassins.

are staying at the inn can be seen in the lounge talking with the
local lowlives who are looking for work, or perhaps just to hear
the latest news of the war with the good races.

    This room serves only one purpose in the town, and that is to
execute traitors of the city.  The execution block lies atop a plat
form no more than six feet in height, and the block itself is large
enough to accomadate even an ogre.  There are slash marks where the
execution axe has been brought down hundreds of times.  The area
around the platform is only a muddy-grass wetland where the local
scum of the city sit to watch the executions, while the upper class
drow elves have preferred seating from balcony's to windows in nearby
houses and appartments.

Tvlar Street~
   Tvlar street seems to be the main north-south street that runs
through the city, from the northern residential districts, to the
great market place, to the training grounds in the southern part
of the city.  Most of all, Tvlar street seems to be more well kept
than the other streets, although only made of cobblestones, it is
a dramatic improvement from the normal mud paths. A large bone
gate lies to the south. The doors to barracks' lie to the east
and to the west.

&+LA Large General Store&n~
    This general store is much like any other general store, the
items in the shop vary from day to day, and there is hardly a common
item in the shop all the time, however, most of the time a customer
is able to get what he wants in one form or another. Shelves line
every wall, and a fat orc sits behind a large counter.

&+LA Small Home&n~
    This small home is rougly built, consiting of only 2 rooms, and
a small wash basin, it isn't much to look at.  However, it does have
the advantage of being in the center of town, which is why many
nobles like to buy such a home.  Occasionally, these homes are
decorated with trophies gotten in battle.

&+rThe Stables of BogenTok&n~
    The stables of BogenTok are quite indistinguishable from any other
stables around the world.  A series of horses are lined up all tied
to their stalls, and a fat orc sits behind a small desk where he rests
inbetween his duties for caring for the animals.  There are several
hay and oats bins, as well as water buckets.  A small underground stream
has been tapped to form a small well in the back.

&+yEntrance to the Army Training Grounds&n~
    The army training grounds are filled with all of the races of
Duris, training to become part of the BogenTok army.  The entrance
is composed of a bone arch leading intro a series of training fields,
houses, and gyms.  The training doesn't seem to be discriminatory
against any of the evil races, from goblin warriors to ogre warriors,
they all flock here to train to be in the army.

&+rThe Bloodmail Factory&n~
    The bloodmail factory is a very delicate operation in the town of
BogenTok, its operation is a necessity to both the inhabitants and
the army that trains in the southern district.  The bloodmail factory
is quite possibly the best factory in the underdark, because this is
the one where almost everyone comes to.  It is headed by a giant-sized
magically altered duergar who has taken the adamantite trade, combined
it with the blood of just about any magical being and fored it into
a new armor, better than before.

&+rThe Processing Room&n~
   Behind the scenes at the factory is the processing room where most
of the work gets done.  The factory is mainly run by duergar and drow
elves.  The drow elves do most of the blood work, while the duergar
handle the molten admantite.  In this gigantic room is the two substances
are split up.  On one side, huge vats of molten adamantite are held,
while on the other side, huge glass containers containing the blood of
drow, trolls, duergar, dragons, and anything even slightly magical. Then,
at the center of the room, the two are mixed while the master drow from
above casts an odd spell upon them, forging them together into a suit
of mail the color of blood, that retains some of the original creature's
properties. Some steps lead up to the master drow and duergar's platform.

    The platform of the bloodmail factory looks over the main cooling
stations where the drow priestess can cast her spells.  Meanwhile,
the duergar platform taskmaster watches over the duergars pouring the
molten lead below him.  Together, the drow priestess and the duergar
taskmaster make a formidable team together.  The platform itself has
a railing to prevent anyone from falling down, and the steps lead
downward towards the main area.

    The general's quarters are probably the best quarters on the
entire grounds, possibly even in the entire city.  The general himself,
is a great duergar war hero who has bravely fought off the good races
of Duris for quite some time.  He has the long war-hardened face
of a warmaster, but the vigor of a youth, and the skill of a master.
The entire quarters are nothing but trophies of weapons and bodyparts
that he has collected over the years.
