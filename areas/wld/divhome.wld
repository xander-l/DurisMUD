&+cA &+WGlowing Portal&+c on the Plane of &+WMist&n~
&+L   The plane of &+Wmists&+L begins with an entrance &+Wportal&+L here.  The
&+wethereal&+L fog that suddenly surrounds all is strangely familiar for
&+Ltravellers from either the true &nethereal&+L plane or &nastral&+L.  It
&+Lappears endless, &+Wlighted&+L by an unknown source that seems to niether
&+Lcast shadows or strain the eyes.  Try as one might, despite the
&+Lrepetitive &+yterrain&+L in all directions, the only moveable direction
&+Lis north.&n

&+Lnorth, west, the only difference between the rooms appears to be
&+Lthe &+mpurple creatures&+L that wander about.  There seems to be noise

&+cThe Pathway of &+WPurity&n~
&+c   The main path within the &+WClouds&+c of the &+WDivine&+c begins here, just
&+ceast of the &+Wivory&+c gates.  &+WAngels&+c of all sorts travel along this
&+cpathway, needing not to exhaust their energies from flying from
&+cone misty landmass to another.  It is said that even the lords
&+cof the elemental planes walk along this path from time to time
&+cas well, coming to pay homage to the titans of justice, albiet just
&+cbefore they drift to the opposite side of the &+WHome&+C of the &+WDivine&n
&+cto pay to tribute to the more darker, more evil, powers who reside

&+cthe &+CPlateau &+cof &+WPurity&+c begins to the south with the sounds of sylphs
&+cand &+Ysirens&+c singing.  The &+Wclouds&+c beneath continue their neverending
&+cshift of movement, making all who are unaccustom to it almost dizzy.
&+cThe &+Wivory&+c gates appear to be nothing more than a dense fog to

&+cby an ancient elven arch-&+Wangel&+c, desperately searching for a way into
&+cthe &+WDivine&+c Kingdom.  The pathway west and north ends dangerously with
&+clack of any sort of substance and even those with the ability to
&+cfly would still fall dramatically.  &+WAngels, &+cArch-&+Wangels&+c, and spirits

&+cserenity overwhelms the senses.  Beneath the feet appears to be
&+cnothing but mist, much like the &+WHome&+C of the &+WDivine's&+c unending
&+cbattleground, but here the mist seems more holy, more pure.  &+WAngels&n
&+cand Arch-&+WAngels&+c gather in this area, casually most of the time, but
&+csometimes to prepare a defense against an invasion.  The Pathway
&+cof &+WPurity&+c lies north of here.&n

&+cWithin a &+WCloud&+L Giant&+c Camp&n~
&+c   This obviously is the heart of the &+Wcloud&+L giant&+c camp.  Guards
&+cwatch over the young &+Lgiants&+c intently, who wander about aimlessly.
&+cMakeshift tents have been set up, and the more drunken &+Lgiants&n
&+claugh and stumble about.  The northern and eastern edge of the camp
&+cends abrubtly with dispersement of the solid &+Wcloudscape&+c, offering
&+cthe unwary a very, very long fall down.&n

&+cWithin a &+WCloud &+LGiant &+cCamp&n~
&+c   The trail of &+Wclouds&+c continues through the cloud giant camp here,
&+cleading to the east.  The &+Wcloud&+L giants&+c walk back and forth through
&+cout their own personal area, confidently believing all noise they
&+cmake is muted by the thickness of the &+Wclouds&+c.  The &+Wangels&+c and
&+Ctitans&+c, however, know all too well of the &+Wcloud &+Lgiant&+c presence
&+cinside the &+WHome&+c and keep a watchful eye over them.

&+cNear the Edge of a &+WCloudy&+c Path&n~
&+c   The leader of &+Wcloud &+Lgiant&+c camp has set up his own tent here,
&+ckeeping close to a guard for his own well being.  Despite the
&+cvery fact there is actually a guard on duty all the &+Wcloud &+Lgiants,&n
&+cincluding the leader, seem overly relaxed until something disturbs
&+cthem.  With courage born from the vast ammounts of liquor consumed
&+cthey attack with the threat intrusion behind them.&n

&+cEnd of a &+WCloudy&+c Path&n~
&+c   The path leading through the &+Wcloud &+Lgiant&+c camp ends rather
&+cabrubtly here with the vanishment of all substantial, all solid
&+Wcloudscape&+c.  If one was to take a step in the wrong direction,
&+ca fall of great magnitude would quickly follow.  The view up here
&+cis amazing however, and is worth a time-out to gaze over the
&+WHome &+cstretched out in all its glory below.&n

&+LLair of a &+wSmoke Dragon&n~
&+r   The &+Wmist&+r becomes dense on all sides other than the west here,
&+roffering the massive &+wsmoke dragon&+r who has made his home here a
&+rsemi-secluded lair.  Although obviously incredibly powerful the
&+wdragon&+r pays little attention to anything other than his nap time.
&+rWhen hungry, the tiny &+Wmist &+rcreatures&+r that continously drift through
&+rthe area offer enough sustenance for the fearsome beast, and provide
&+rhim with food with the minimal ammount of effort.&n

&+CEm&+citi&+Con's&+c Back Room&n~
&+c   The assistant of &+CEm&+citi&+Con&+c is a recluse in nature and thus
&+cremains in a room hidden behind the &+CEm&+citi&+Con's&+c main work room,
&+caway from the forge, &+Lanvil&+c, and most importantly, the people
&+cof the &+WPalace&+c.  This room, surrounded by the typical stone,
&+cis barred by an almost invisible white door, blended perfectly
&+cinto the western wall.

&+cWith the &+Wclouds&+c contiously in motion within the &+WHome&+c it is easy
&+cto miss a pathway or a trail that is visible one moment then
&+cobscured the next.  The &+Wcloudscape&+c raises with a slight accent
&+chere, however, watching ones feet would be a wise idea as a fall
&+cfrom this height could quickly end one's life.&n

&+ccountless years, however over time the &+Wgrif&+Yfon's&+c numbers have
&+cdimished greatly.  The &+Wcloud&+c becomes too thin in all other
&+cdirections here, thin enough to no longer support any wieght,
&+cthus not accessable.&n

&+cand dazzling lights, making it difficult to concentrate.  This
&+cprison, contructed by the &+bill&+Bus&+Wionary&+c powers of &+WAmp&+Chel&+ces is usually
&+cfull after a raid into the &+LPits of &+rCerebrus&+c, but over time, the
&+ccaptives are either shown the &+Wlight&+c of goodness or are traded for
&+cother prisoners.  Currently, the prison is nearly empty.&n
