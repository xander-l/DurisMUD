&+yDrawbridge Before the Citadel~
   This drawbridge is composed of some unknown material -- material that is
resistant to the affects of the odd magical river it bridges.  The water
below shimmers oddly. To the south lies the underworld, while to the north
is a huge double door.  No locks or knobs or handholds are apparent in the
face of the massive onyx doors; the only decoration are powerful magical
runes worked into their surface in gold.

A Washroom~
   This small (very small) room serves as a personal washroom for the
apprentice residing in the adjoining room.  There is a toilet, sink, shower
and tub all combined into one!  Very rudimentary facilities, but very

An Apprentice's Abode~
   This room is very small and very functional.  The furniture consists of
a bed, a bookshelf and a chest containing clothes and other personal items.
Since the majority of an apprentice's time is spent in study, they have
little need or use for anything else.

&+rThe Apprentices' Hallway~
   This hallway is dimly lit by magical glowing spheres set into the walls
at regular intervals.  The floor is plushly carpeted with a red shag
oriental rug that covers the entire floor, muting the sound of footsteps.
Along the walls of the hallway are doors leading into the minuscule abodes
of the apprentices.

&+BThe Citadel Library~
   This library is spacious and well lighted; there are shelves and shelves
of books occupying this open floor.  Scattered around the room are desks
and chairs and reading couches and the occasional flowering plant or two.
The books that line the shelves are of both magical and mundane natures,
some written in spidery hand, others etched into stone by inhuman hands.
Whatever the case, it is most likely not a good idea to tamper with them.

   This laboratory is spacious, clean, well lit and sterile.  There are a
few tables with a bit of bizarre looking lab apparatus perched on them, a
few shelves full of carefully labeled bottles of liquids and amalagrams, a
few chalkboards covered with lines and lines of equations.  There is an odd
fragrance in the air, something not quite placeable but recognizable to all.

&+GTemperate Zone in the Greenhouse~
   This room is as large as the library, but all the magic bound in books
in the library has been unleased here!  This is some sort of greenhouse,
magically constructed so that the weather in one place is tropical, then
ten feet away is arctic!  It seems as if every type of weather condition is
represented here -- tundra, desert, temperate climes, tropical -- there is
even a simulation of the ocean somehow set up, with a small island with
arctic conditions in the southeast corner.  Different zones seem to be used
to grow different plants or cultivate different reagents.  This particular
room is temperate; there is not much difference from this room than most of
the weather outside, but the mages of the tower have reconstructed those
conditions anyway.  They're probably too lazy to climb down four sets of
stairs to get outside.

   This room is as large as the library, but all the magic bound in books
in the library has been unleashed here!  This is some sort of greenhouse,
magically constructed so that the weather in one place is tropical, then
ten feet away is arctic!  It seems as if every type of weather condition is
represented here -- tundra, desert, temperate climes, tropical -- there is
even a simulation of the ocean somehow set up, with a small island with
arctic conditions in the southeast corner.  Different zones seem to be used
to grow different plants or cultivate different reagents.  This particular
room is temperate; there is not much difference from this room than most of
the weather outside, but the mages of the tower have reconstructed those
conditions anyway.  They're probably too lazy to climb down four sets of
stairs to get outside.

ground is partially frozen dirt, out of which wimpy little plants grow.
The light is sparse but piercing, and the air surprisingly fresh.

clean, fine white sand the consistency of sugar, but it still tastes

several other types of magical spells laid on the room.  There is a

inch marked with some type of rune or other; however, all these runes seem
to have been broken or deactivated when the Master Rune was broken -- it
was placed over the door so when the door opened, the runes stopped
functioning.  Yet the traces of powerful magic remain in the air.

   This room is fairly large, about twice the size of the foyer far below.
One wall is covered with shelves full of books and bottles.  The desk,
placed to one side, is the size of a bed a giant would use, and messy,
covered with parchments, books and various magical odds and ends.  Nearby
is a table almost the same size -- this one covered by flasks and glass
tubing and other glassware.  A fireplace is set within the east wall, and a
small table and several comfortable chairs are set around it.  Prominent
in the south wall is a door with a large stylized hourglass entwined with
an infinity symbol.

A Bizarre Corridor~
   The walls, floor and ceiling are constructed of the same odd onyx-like
material that has been occurring over and over again within the citadel;
Like the hallway outside the Master's study, in the gloom the golden
specks deep within the surface of the material provide ample light to see
by.  The impression of standing in the middle of space in the middle of
billions of stars is even stronger here, and the specks within the walls
seem to move slowly, as if they really were stars doing some cosmic dance.

A Bizarre Corridor~
   The strange corridor comes to an end here.  In a wall full of stars
an enormous door is set.  The door is constructed entirely of nightstone;
its sheer blackness is a stark contrast to the star filled depths of the
walls of the corridor.  Whereas they were bright, this door is as dark as
an area of space where all the stars have died.

&+L   Suspended in space and time, this room has been isolated from the world
&+Lby thick magic-absorbing nightstone walls. The only way out seems to be through
&+Lthe black portal door visible in the eastern wall.
