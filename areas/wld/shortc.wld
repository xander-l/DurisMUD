&+GA Muddy Path &+gLeading to &+rSlave &+RCamp&n~
&+g   Here the muddy path begins. It leads from west to east, or from east to
&+gwest as other would say. As those who go east never return, unless someone
&+gdecides to drag their corpses this path. As east from here, there is a great
&+gorcish slave camp, resource of fresh slaves for Split Shield village.
&+g The path itself looks rather dull and not interessing at all.
&+gWest from here, the path joins wider road.

   Well, i said already that the path is dull and uninteresting, didn't I?
Listen, if you are going to check every possible item in every possible room
in the world, you'll eventually end up buried under landslide caused by a small
stone you picked up to check what it is.
   And now some vocabulary lesson. Do you know the word 'intuition'?
This is a wonderful thing that lets you distinguish things interesting from
rather dull and noninteresting without actually looking at them.
Of course, it may fail, but overall netto sum is positive.
Ahh, why i bother saying this. You DID look at the path, so most probably you
do not have any intuition at all.          &+MPity, isn't it?&n

&+gBefore a &+rSlave &+RCamp&n~
&+g   Here the path ends, and a large slave camp can be seen to the east.
&+gWest from here, the path continues, joining some wider road in some distance.
&+gNorth and south, the way is blocked by piles of rubble coming from nearby
&+gobsidian mines. There are many fresh footprints in the mud here, meaning a new
&+gtransport of slaves has just arrived.

   There are some footprints in the mud. In fact, quite a lot of them.
For a brief moment you catch a glimne of something shiny buried in the mud.
Or maybe it was just an illusion.

   You just HAD to do that, didn't you? Ok, here the path continues.
Still dull and uninteresting. Full of mud. And footprints. And whatnot.
And if you search hard enough there might be something buried in the mud.
Just dont blame me if you cause a landslide.

&+yInside the &+rSlave &+yEncampement&n~
&+y   This is the main square of the slave encampement. In all directions except
&+ywest, there are barracks ment to keep various races locked together.
&+yTo the north, there are elves and half-elves. To the east, humans and gnomes
&+yare being kept. Barbarians and dwarves are locked just south from here.
&+yA muddy path, obviously the only connection between the encampement and the
&+yobsidian mines, starts just west from here.
&+yThere's a small well in the center of the square.

&+yClosed wooden doors smeared with tar block the sight inside their rooms.
&+yThe central square of the encampement lies just south from here.

&+yBetween Eastern Slave Cells&n~
&+y   This is the inside of one of slave barracks. This barrack is dedicated to
&+ykeep humans and gnomes locked tightly. Becouse those races breed rather
&+yexplosively compared to other good ones, this barrack is slightly bigger
&+ythan the rest in this camp. Human cells are located north from here, while
&+y gnomes are kept to the south. Closed wooden doors block the sigh, so it's
&+yimpossible to peer into their rooms. The central square of the encampement
&+ylies just west from here, while a small wooden door is visible in the east
&+ywall.

&+yDogs Pen&n~
&+y   This fence-surrounded place behind slaves barracks is a living area for a
&+yhuge dog, private property and puppy of the orcish camp master. He drags old or
&+yweak slaves here, for his dog to devour them. &+rThat's why all the ground is
&+rblodstained and there are pieces of torn clothing and smashed bones&+y scattered
&+yall around here.
