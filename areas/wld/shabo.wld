&+LA &+bWater&N &+LFilled Tunnel&N~
The floor of the tunnel here rises, the &+bwater&N covering only around
two feet deep.  Walking is treacherous, as the smooth stone is very slippery.
To the west you can make a huge underground cavernous lake, to the north
the tunnel narrows, and the dim outline of a huge gate can be seen.

The tunnel narrows here, and the rough edges of the walls seem to indicate
that it was recently dug.  The floor, immersed in water and quite slippery,
slants slightly downward, causing the stream to flow toward the massive

The great gates of the city are 30' tall.  A long slide from the cavern,
between the outer, and inner gates of the city slopes gently downward, a
steady stream of water pouring out into the Sunless Sea. Along each side
of the Sluice, stairs have been cut into the stone, for the many humans and
demi-human slaves of the Aboleth to access the city.

The inner gates to the city lie to your south.  The cannals which make up
the "streets" of the Great Shaboath run north, east, and west from here.
The water is only 2 feet deep, but makes moving uncomfortable, and slightly
hard.  The architecture of the aboleths is bizaarre, swirling columns, and
odd, angular points jut out of the squat, almost round buildings around.

The avenue between the wall and the buildings is wide here, the constant
stream of water below you're feet moving sluggishly around the city.  Just
to the west lie the city gates, while the wall, and canal stretch off out
of sight to the east.

Set just off the avenue to the north is a squat tower.  Water flows out
from the tower in every direction, from small, three inch crevaces at
its base.  A squat, oval doorway leads into the dark interior.

to the east, swirls about two feet deep.  The wall to the south rises
some thirty feet into the air, and the slippery coating on it makes it
unclimbable.  The same strange force that prevents flying in the city
permeates the air here, as well.

&+LEntrance to the Tower Complex&N~
The central path of Shaboath runs east/west here.  The murky water flows
slowly to the east, and the dark, empty sky of the Sunless Sea rises
up above you.  To the north, enclosed by an inner wall, rise five huge
towers.  A gateway into the courtyard shows that the towers, each facing
the central tower, seem to be similar in design to each other.  Truely,
this is the dark heart of Shaboath.

&+LThe Black-Ceilinged Chamber&N~
The ramp from here continues back down to the first floor.  A swirling
whorl of blackness floats in the center of the room, thin magical beams
of energy lead out through the walls, presumably to the four tertiary
towers.  The ceiling level of this chamber appears to be just inky
blackness, insubstantiality.

&+LA &+bWater&N &+LFilled Tunnel&N~
The floor of the tunnel here rises, the &+bwater&N covering only around
two feet deep.  Walking is treacherous, as the smooth stone is very slippery.
To the west you can make a huge underground cavernous lake, to the north
the tunnel narrows, and the dim outline of a huge gate can be seen.
