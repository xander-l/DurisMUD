&+ya Well Traveled Path&N~
&+y   This hard dirt path seems to be rather well traveled.  Broken &Ntwigs &+yand&n
&+ytraces of footprints are present on the ground.  Sounds of villagers can be&n
&+yheard laughing and joking.  The songs of &+bbirds &+ycascade on the cool calm breeze.&n
&+yThe air here is crisp, cool, and pure, creating a mystic mood of &+Wpeace&+y.  The&n
&+ypath continues on to the South and West.  There appears to be a thinning of
&+ythe thick brush to the north.&n

&+yWithin &+GS&+gmok&+rev&+ge&+ril&n &+yForest&N~
&+g   A strange &+Gsmell&+g is thick within the &+Wair&+g, its like you have never &+Gsmelt&+g&n
&+gbefore you seem strangely drawn to it.  Its as if you cant help but wanna find &n
&+gthe source of it.  A slight breeze blows causing the &+ytrees&+g to sway and start to&n
&+gcrash against each other gently.  This &+yforest&+g seems strange yet not foreboding &n
&+gor dangerous.  Its almost an odd &+Wpeace&+g that you can't quite place.  Animals    &n
&+gscurry about all over yet not many look to &+rmenacing&+g or &+Ldeadly&+g.  You almost feel&n
&+gas if you are truly at home yet alone and unhampered by siblings that only     &n
&+gcause you untold &+Lmisery&+g.  You feel as if you could stay here forever and simply&n
&+glive in &+Wpeace&+g and quiet.  Can this place truly be for &+Greal&+g or is this just your&n
&+gimagination.  You start to ponder, your childhood and how you become to be&n
&+gwhat you are now.  You think back to all the &+Ldecisions&+g that you have had to&n
&+gmake over the years to bring you to this place now.&n

   &+gThe &+yforest &+gstarts to get thicker with vegetation here.  The &+ytrees&+g block&n
&+gthe wind from getting to you.  As you stop to listen you hear &+Gstrange &+Lsounds&n
&+gcoming from the north west area, you cant quite figure out what they are.      &n
&+gYou almost feel its best you &+rnever &+gfind out whats making the &+Lsounds&+g.  For some &n
&+godd reason you still feel safe in this &+yforest&+g.  Something so &+Wpeaceful &+gcomes    &n
&+gfrom this &+yforest&+g its like you have never experienced before.  Perhaps you shall&n
&+gstay in this &+yforest &+gforever, in this &+Gstrange &+Wparadise&+g.  Now the &+rungodly &+Lsounds &n
&+gstart to fade out on the &+Wbreeze&+g.  The &+Gsongs &+gof the &+bbirds &+gcan be heard once more&n
&+gas if nothing had happened at all.  Maybe the &+Gmist &+gof this &+yforest&+g is starting to&n
&+gcloud your mind.  Who is to say what is real and what is purely fantasy.  Now  &n
&+gyou know your reality is starting to slip away the longer you stay here.  You &n
&+gstart to drift off to &+Recstasy&+g, the &+Gsmell &+gonce thought &+Gstrange&+g is now &+rcraved&n
&+gmore than you can understand.  Is this &+Mmental &+gor &+Wphysical&+g, you start to ponder&n
&+gthan forget your train of thought.  You see small &+yanimal &+gtracks leading to the&n
&+gwest, should be an easy &+rkill&+g.&n

&+g   Something about this s&+Gpot &+gmakes you feel &+rdizzy&+g.  Your really not quite sure&n
&+gwhy but for some odd reason you feel really &+Mlight &+Lheaded&+g.  As if you were about&n
&+gto pass out.  Perhaps your &+rage &+gis finally catching up to you, or maybe its the &n
&+Gfumes&+g.  They are starting to &+Loverwelm &+gyou the longer you stay here the &+Gstranger&n
&+gyou feel.  Why is this &+yforest&+g so &+Gstrange&+g yet &+Wfriendlier&+g than any other &+yforest  &n
&+gyou have visited.  Your &+rproblems &+Lstart &+gto &+Wslip &+Gaway &+gand you realize they really&n

&+glonger and thats all that will truly matter.  You start to break into &+Gstrange &n
&+Wlaughter&+g, the more you fight the more you laugh.  So strange to be laughing  &n
&+gfor really no reason at all.  You stop to listen to the &+Lsounds&+g of the &+yforest   &n
&+gand most of them seem rather inviting.  Except for this &+rstrange &+Lsound &+gthat you &n
&+gcan not quite place it seems very &+rdisturbing&+g.  The &+yanimals&+g seem to be acting   &n

&+galmost as if you are seeing things.  You start to ponder on whether the fumes&n

&+g  This &+Clake&+g must hold many a tear of a broken &+Rheart&+g.  You stare off into the  &n

&+gthat grand &+Ghigh&+g you once knew.  Fade into reality again your &+Rheart&+g breaks and &n
&+gyou feel even more pain then you did then.  Or so you think till you recall   &n
&+gall or your suffering.  A &+Bchill&+g hits your back, its only the wind of &+Wtruth&+g.   &n
&+gYou take a deep breath and look around at your surroundings.  It is time to   &n
&+gforget the past again, so that life can again exist.  Time to bury and hide   &n
&+gyour pain behind false smiles and half hearted chuckles.  You notice that you &n
&+gare on a &+yrocky &+Cshore &+gline within &+GS&+gmok&+rev&+ge&+ril &+yForest&+g.  Again you can hear the    &n
&+gsounds of the &+yforest&+g.  The &+Bwaters&+g of the lake are &+Wpeacefull&+g and for now so is&n

&+g   The &+yforest &+ghere is calm and &+Wpeaceful&+g, a small breeze blows in from the&n
&+gsouth.  You notice &+Wseagulls &+gcircling a small &+blake &+gthat is a few moves to your&n
&+gsouth.  They seem to be looking for food or perhaps they are simply taunting&n
&+gyou with their gift of flight.  Perhaps you shall decide it is time to end&n
&+gtheir gift of life.  You start to think what it might be like if you could&n
&+gtruly fly.  You imagine the sensation of being able to &+Ccoast &+gon the winds of&n
&+WOdin&+g.  Maybe in another life you shall be blessed with this gift, but now you&n
&+gare stuck in this life.  A life you often times wish to end, yet few times find&n
&+gthe courage to even try it.  The fear in failure to end your true failure, that&n
&+gis the greatest fear of all.  Your mind shifts back into reality and you notice&n
&+ga &+Ldead &+ganimal on the ground.  You gaze at the animal for a second and reflect&n
&+gin your mind, you think about your life and the actions you have done in the&n

&+L   You gaze at this &+yanimal &+Land you realize that perhaps &+rsuicide &+Lis not the&n
&+Lanswer.  Seeing the reality of death often times helps to sober up your mind&n
&+Land make you realize things really are not that bad.  Life was not meant to be&n
&+Leasy, it was meant to be what you make it.  Realizing you probably read room&n
&+Ldescriptions I knew something was up.  The decay of death is strong and&n
&+Lprominent the cause you can not quite figure out.  Perhaps this poor &+yanimal &+Lwas&n
&+Lnever truly alive, perhaps he took his own life.  You start to wonder whether&n
&+Lthis &+yrodent &+Llike creature took his own life.  Maybe he decided to overdose on&n
&+Lnuts and &+ybeer&+L.  Whatever caused his death for some strange reason you seem to&n

&+gfor a moment to the &+bbirds&+g singing there &+Gsongs&+g, you almost wish you could&n

&+gseem as if they were carved centuries ago.  In a time when this &+yforest&+g probably&n

&+rRushdie &+LInn&n~
&+L   Well polished &+ywood &+Lpanels line the walls here, and a large &+Rfire &+Lburns in the&N
&+rfireplace&+L.  Several &+ytables &+Land &+ychairs &+Ldot the room.  The eerie effect of the&n
&+Lshadows on the wall plays tricks on your eyes.  A scent of &+yale &+Land fried &+Wbunny&n
&+Lpermeates the air here.  The room narrows to the south, where a &+ydoor &+Lcan be&n
&+Lseen.&n

&+wdeal out cold despair, no longer a worry to any who stare.  Wings once that&N
&+wknew flight, now only filled with &+Rs&+rpot&+Rted &+wcrimson plight.  Dreams of a being&N
&+wthat those who dwell in the light can only imagine, soon shall be into the no&N
&+wlonger.  The call from the grave, nothing shall ever be left to even save.  I&N

black white bearskins~
&+y   These &+Ls&+wk&+Lins &+yseem to show no signs of forced entry, it almost appears that&N

&+yor life force.  Hung upon walls that hide untold despair, trophies of torment&N
&+ythat pretend to show triumph.  The white &+Ws&+Lk&+Wins &+ymost likely came from a polar&N
&+ybear or some kind of other &+Wa&+Cr&+Wt&+Ci&+Wc &+ydwelling denzein.  While the &+Lblackness &+yof the&N
&+Ldead &+ybeasts most likely came from the forest of &+GM&+gist&+ygrave.  Images of life are&N

&+L   This head seems to of come from a rather old black dragon.  Eyes that once&N
&+Lheld &+revil &+Ldesire, no longer even flicker with a glint of &+Rfire&+L.  &+WFangs &+Lfilled&N
&+Lwith ferocious fury, now simply act as a symbol of a creature that once was.&N
&+LCreature of the &+bnight&+L, bringer of untold fright, might once made it right and&N
&+Lnow the being lacks even sight.  Decapatated in a &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd&+ry &+Lfight or slain while&N
&+Lthe monster was simply faded into sleep.  A myth now forced into a memory with&N
&+Lonly a pathetic &+wtrophy &+Lof what it once was.&N

wild boars~
&+R   Eyes &+Lthat even in death hold untold undieing &+rhate&+L, seeking still even from&N
&+Lthe beyond to deal out fatal fate.  &+rT&+Ru&+rsk&+Rs &+Lof terror that still bear stains of&N
&+Lfallen foes who felt wrongful wrath.  These heads rest as trophies from beings&N
&+Lthat have been turned from the life into the dead.  Out of the light and into&N
&+Lthe dismal d&+barkne&+Lss of despair, &+Rt&+ro&+Rr&+rm&+Re&+rn&+Rt&+Led or &+rt&+Ro&+rr&+Rt&+ru&+Rr&+re&+Ld, now simply trophied.&N

giant~
&+L   A head that once rested upon a body that could bring untold dread.  Eyes of&N
&+Lfallen &+Rfire&+L, now do not hold even a &+wflicker &+Lof desire.  A creature that walked&N
&+Lthe lands, causing all who saw to feel feeble fear.  This huge head most likely&N
&+Lwas not handed over to the &+gh&+Gu&+gnt&+Ge&+gr &+Lwithout a fearsome fight.  You wonder how a&N
&+Lbeing that held so much might could be forced to lose sight.  Inside your glad&N
&+Lthat this monster is no longer able to deal out any despair.  No feelings of&N
&+Lloss are felt for this slain bitter beast.  Feasting on &+rflesh &+Lof mortals can&N
&+Lnot be done for the giant is just that.&N
~
E
dwarves dorfs several~
&+L   These heads of fallen &+Ydwarves &+Lhave been preserved almost without flaw.  As&N
&+Lyou gaze at the decapatated heads you wonder how and by who they were slain by.&N
&+LThe heads number three in total, the first head has lifeless brown &+yeyes&+L, a long&N
&+Lgangly beard that is an ebon color, ears that seem at least five sizes to big&N
&+Lfor the creature and the name &+wSlappy &+Lhas been etched into the plaque that rests&N
&+Lbelow the head.  The second head has eyes of &+rhat&+Lr&+re&+Ld that have been snuffed of&N
&+Lany life, ears that stick out colored an odd tan, teeth that have mostly fell&N
&+Linto &+Rrot &+Land left the being long before death, a &+Wbeard &+Lof white that no longer&N
&+Lholds any fight and the name &+bJ&+Lae&+br&+Lo&+bd &+Lhas been etched at the bottom of the beast.&N
&+LThe third head of the final one who is dead, &+weyes &+Lno longer fueled with hatred&N
&+Lor futile desire, fire that has &+rburn&+Led the ears of this small creature, teeth&N
&+Lthat know little more then &+wdecay &+Land &+Rrot&+L, hair of raven blackness that flowed&N
&+Lat one time upon a back of burden, an unruley beard that has heard voices from&N
&+Lbeyond the grave, the name &+rKvarg &+Letched into the &+ctarnished &+Lplaque that the once&N
&+Lproud neck of this dorf has been mounted into.  Sounds of suffering can almost&N
&+Lbe heard as you gaze into the eyes of these once mighty warriors.  No longer to&N
&+Lfight for what they thought to be right, death is now their final plight.  Yet&N
&+Lthat was not enough, forced to be &+wtrophies &+Lforever locked into &+rt&+Ro&+rrm&+Re&+rnt&+Led peril.&N
~
E
displacer beast~
&+L   Eyes that glow with an eerie green &+Ghaze&+Ld look even in dismal cold death.&N
&+RF&+ra&+Rng&+rs &+Lof forgotten fury dotted by stains of slain prey that can no longer pray.&N
&+LThe head of a puma like beast that gave so many release from the lie of life.&N
&+LA hunter that was hunted and lost the final fight, &+Rcursed &+Lto be locked as an&N
&+Leternal &+wtrophy&+L.  Mounted and displayed as if a pathetic prize captured within&N
&+Lthe time it had to live.  A mind that is not one with the once broad bulky body&N
&+Lof a hateful being.  &+rScars &+Lof battles that were not the last still can be seen&N
&+Lupon the &+bface &+Lof this fallen foe.&N
~
E
owlbear~
&+L   This creature seems to be a creation of some demented wizard, or perhaps a&N
&+bmystic &+Lbet.  The monster seems to be a cross between an &+yowl &+Land a bear of some&N
&+Lsort.  The beak of this being is an &+Wivory &+Lcolour and the terrifying eyes are&N
&+Lred-&+rr&+Ri&+rmm&+Re&+rd&+L.  Life no longer fills this entity with aggression or torment, once&N
&+Lfeared now only another trophied head forced into &+wdead&+L.&N
~
E
troll~
&+L   Green &+gskin &+Lfilled with untold unholy sin, &+Reyes &+Lof fire burn with hatred for&N
&+Lall those who dare to stare.  A glare from beyond forcing mortal &+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+Cs &+Lto &+rburn&N
&+Lwith dismal despair.  The creature is mounted and a plaque at the bottom of it&N
&+Lhas the word &+gT&+Go&+gk&+Ge&+ge &+Letched into it.  Perhaps this is just wishful thinking or&N
&+Lcould this be the head of the legend himself.  Wonder can only continue till&N
&+Lthe &+bnight &+Lfades into the day, hide in the light or he shall end your sight.&N
&+LCare for the plight of none, he only needs to hunt as one, not even in fear of&N
&+Lthe sun.  Winds of death wash over shores of &+rK&+Lar&+ra&+L-&+rS&+Lheh&+rr&+L, broken &+Wbones &+Ldrift on&N
&+Ltides of torment.  &+wOnly death is real&+L, reality is nothing but a dark delusion.&N
~
E
unicorn~
&+L   This head comes from the mystical creature known as the &+Wunicorn&+L.  This once&N
&+Lpowerful steed has a gleaming coat of pure white &+Whair&+L.  The eyes of this being&N
&+Lare a &+bdeep &+Bsea &+Cblue &+Lthat no longer hold life within them.  Long, silky white&N
&+Lstrands of &+Whair &+Lhang down from the mane and forelock.  A single &+Wivory&+L-colored&N
&+Lhorn that spans about three feet in length grows from the center of the colt's&N
&+Lforehead.  The &+Wpowder &+Lbeard beneath the entity's chin spans around one foot in&N
&+Lsize.  This noble beast once dwelled inside majestic &+ywood&+Llands with his mate,&N
&+Lnow he is just another &+wtrophy &+Lfor the delight of a &+gh&+Gu&+gnt&+Ge&+gr&+L.  No longer to see&N
&+Lthe &+Rs&+ru&+Rn &+Lrise, only to be &+rdamned &+Lto wander in the &+Reternal &+Ldemonical &+ctwilight&+L.&N
~
E
small halfling~
&+L   The head of this small &+yhalfling &+Lseems to show signs that it was bashed by a&N
&+Lblunt object.  &+BEyes &+Lof blue that no longer know the lie that is called by many&N
&+Llife.  Long gangly brown &+yhair &+Lthat once flowed past shoulders now simply flows&N
&+Lwithout reason.  Now simply a head that has become a &+wtrophy &+Lof a game &+gh&+Gu&+gnt&+Ge&+gr&+L.&N
~
E
skins cats great~
&+L   The skins and heads of all the great cats aligns this dismal room of dead&N
&+wtrophies&+L.  The mighty &+Yc&+Lhe&+Ye&+Lta&+Yh&+L, powerful &+yj&+La&+rg&+Lua&+yr&+L, graceful &+Ll&+ye&+Lo&+yp&+La&+yr&+Ld, &+ycommon lion&+L,&N
&+ymountain lion&+L, s&+ypot&+Lted &+ylion&+L, giant lynx, wild &+Lt&+ri&+Lg&+re&+Lr, and even the &+Lsmil&+wo&+Ld&+wo&+Ln all&N
&+Lrest upon the ground side by side.  These once mighty creatures are now simply&N
&+Lornaments for the amusement of a heartless &+gh&+Gu&+gnt&+Ge&+gr&+L.  Once these cats roamed the&N
&+Lrealms with pride and brought fear to all those who dared to gaze upon their&N
&+Lmajestic beauty.  Now nothing more then skinned husks of what they once were,&N
&+Lwhen they were free to be.  Victims who left many, now simply what they once&N
&+Lcreated for their very survival.  Images of proud beasts, now formed to dead.&N

&+ya &+rRotted &+LCottage&n~
&+L   This home contains a &+ywooden &+Lbed, a simple &+ydesk&+L, a &+ychair &+Land a &+ytable&+L.  On the&n
&+Ltable are piled a number of pieces or &+rrotted &+yleather&+L, several of which have&n
&+Lbeen sewn together to form the beginnings of some sort of crude suit of &+yleather&n
&+Larmor.  This place seems to be almost abandoned now with no signs of any life&n
&+Levident.  Perhaps at one time this place was a &+yleatherworker's &+Lshop.  Now it is&n
&+Lsimply a &+rRotted &+LCottage.&n

&+y   This chair has seen better days, perhaps it is on its last day.&N
~
E
desk~
&+y   This desk has been crafted from a good grade of hard wood.  It shows many&N
&+yyears of wear, both natural and unnatural.  The word &+r'&+LSATAN&+r' &+yhas been etched&N
&+yinto it, while an &+Linverted &+Rpentagram &+yhas been crudely drawn beneath the word.&N
&+yOther scratches and chips are also evident, this desk does not seem like it&N
&+ycontinues to see regular use.&N
~
E
bed wooden~
&+Y   Hay&+y, this bed is so old thats what it is made of.  The supports consist of&N
&+yropes that are intersected to create a primative means of support.  What little&N
&+yframe that does exist has been crafted from a cheap grade of soft wood.  This&N
&+yobject does not seem like it has been used by anyone, except maybe a fast toss&N
&+ythat might of produced one of the &+Btiny &+Winfants &+ythat do not seem to be wanted.&N
&+yAs you inspect the bed more you notice what seems to be a few lines drawn down&N
&+yand every four are intersected by another line at an angle to create five.&N
~
E
table~
&+y   This table seems to of been crafted from a rather decent grade of hard wood.&N
&+yIt seems rather sturdy and you notice as you gaze at it that it has some tiny&N
&+ymarks and chips upon it as well as some bits of leather.  The words &+r'&+LKill or&N
&+Lbe Killed&+r' &+yhave been etched into the middle of the table.&N
~
E
inverted pentagram symbol~
&+L   This symbol has been drawn here by one of those who is of the &+wunlight&+L.  It&N
&+Ldepicts a goat within an inverted pentagram that is enclosed by a circle.  The&N
&+Whorns&+L of the beast are thrust upward in denial of the &+rtr&+Ri&+rn&+Ri&+rty&+L and the mouth is&N
&+Lpointed downward.  The ears of this being flow to the east and to the west and&N
&+Lare within the points of the pentagram.  The eyes of this black goat seem to&N
&+Lpenetrate the soul and sends an eerie &+Bchill&+L within the body.  Fears long since&N
&+Lthought dead invade the mind and become the present.  The regrets of your life&N
&+Lbecomes all that you can think of.  You wonder how you could of been so wrong&N
&+Lin following the light.  D&+barkne&+Lss is the true power and to deny that is to&N
&+Lremain feeble.  The visions blur and twist into an odd array of nothingness.&N
~

rotted leather~
&+y   Bits of half made items from &+rrotted &+yleather align this once grand room.  A&N
&+ysymbol of &+RBozk &+ycan be seen etched into one of the pieces of armor.  The image&N
&+yseems to of been drawn in the &+Rblood &+yof a creature that was at one time filled&N
&+ywith life.  &+rStains &+yof the past dot the objects creating how they appear in the&N
&+ynow of the present.  In the future they shall continue to mark the battles of&N
&+yhistory that they were part of.  This shop most likely was the most important&N
&+yof the &+Lvillage&+y, until the &+Lblacksmith &+ymoved in and created better and harder to&N
&+ydamage items.  You wonder what ever happened to the old leather maker, has he&N
&+ypassed on or simply left the town hoping to find a place more in need of him.&N

bozk~
&+R   Eyes &+Lof demonical fire burn within a &+cs&+Co&+cu&+Cl &+Lscourned image of dismal death.&N
&+LThe cries of the lost fill your mortal mind as you gaze at this symbol of the&N
&+Lone known as &+RBozk&+L.  Graves that are filled with bodies of those who dared to&N
&+Ldefy the d&+barkne&+Lss burn in the &+ctwilight &+Lof &+wunlight&+L.  Suffering of the fallen&N
&+Lfools who thought they could survive the fires of the black abyss.  Screams of&N
&+Ltorment, torture of the meek, death to any who seek.  Focus wishes it was no&N
&+Llonger as reality fades into a &+bnight&+Lmare.  Heads upon stakes, &+Rbl&+ro&+Ro&+rd &+Lapon thine&N
&+Lground, eyes rolled by fatal fate.  Hate of the light, &+Bthunder &+Lcrackles within&N
&+Lthe demonic air.  &+CSh&+Wi&+Cv&+We&+Crs &+Lslowly stream down your &+Wspine&+L, nothing at all seems&N
&+Lto be even near fine.  Time drifts into limbo, what is real no longer can be&N
&+Lrealized for sure.  Images from the past becomes the present, resent, descent,&N
&+Lall flowing into &+Rpain&+L.  &+CRain &+Lof &+Ws&+Ce&+Wrp&+Ce&+Wnt&+Ci&+Wn&+Ce &+Lwinter falls from out the &+wclouded&N
&+Lsky of the raven realms.  Flickering, fading, changing, pupils dilate, things&N
&+Lalmost drift back into sane.  Insane voices echo inside your hollow head, yet&N
&+Lyou can not make out what they are saying.  &+wWhispers &+Lfrom beyond eternal &+bnight&N
&+Lfill the body with untold fright.  Might makes right, no matter the height, to&N
&+Ldestroy those who dare to ever care.  Cast them not but a &+Bcold &+Llifeless stare,&N

burnt stump~
&+LBranded and &+rburned &+Linto a dark raven despair, a soul scorned, twisted to form&N
&+Leternal.  Resting now, and forever shall be, a sad display to one who once&N
&+Lwalked among us.  How life can be, sooner ended then later, sent to meet thy&N
&+Lmaker.  Hoping it not to be a simple quaker, who shall end up as an empty&N
&+Ltaker.  So many pass by, yet how many really stop to stare, or even really try&N
&+Lto simply care.  No glare is cast, nor shall ever it be.  Bent into an odd&N
&+Lstare, wondering just why some are here, and others no longer.  Those that are&N
&+Ltaken and the ones who end it all.  Which one is this, whose grave is not much&N
&+Lmore then a burnt stump.  Did death destroy destiny causing his &+Reternal &+Ldefeat.&N
&+LA question is a statement that few truly make, and many more often mistake.  I&N
&+Lnever really liked cake nor for heavens sake.  &+ySplinters &+Lshall befall into us&N
&+Lall.  Dots of black are moving upon the burnt wood.  Walking upon a fallen mark&N
&+Lof a life once lived.  How long has this been, or how long has the one who doth&N
&+Ldwell within it been here.  Will this fate one day fall upon your shoulders&N
&+Lshall this come to pass.  Insects invade us all, no respect, only hatred for us&N
&+Lwho are of the &+rflesh&+L.  They seek to devour our bodies for their own evil needs.&N
&+LDeeds of deception from demons of &+rD&+Le&+rM&+Lor&+rT&+Les.  Death Means Truth, life is only an&N
&+Lillusion seeking to deceive.  Nothing is real, only death is real.  Some bits&N
&+Lof &+Wbone &+Lcan be seen within the knots of wood.  Many shall wish to achieve yet&N
&+Lmore then few shall falter and fail.  A candle that has been burnt out now is&N
&+Lmarked by another life that has flickered into fade.    Decay and Death&N
&+LA burnt &+rtree &+ystump &+Lrests here eternally.........Without a Master&N

deer~
&+y   This tiny deer stands a little under one foot tall.  She has &+Lspots &+ythat are&n

&+Llife.  Her young lips gently touch the surface of the &+Wpeaceful &+Clake &+Land her&N
&+Lmoist &+Rtongue &+Ltouches the same as she quenches her thirst.  As you gaze at the&N
&+Lscene thoughts of revenge start to fade into memories of joy.  The creature&N
&+Ldoes not know to fear predators yet, a glimpse of innocence within a world of&N
&+Ltormenting corruption.  Reality once flickered into fade, now shifts back into&N
&+Lthat thought to be sane.&N

&+Lwith &+Bwater&+L.  Several different kinds of &+cmetal &+Land other things are strewn about&n
&+Lthe room.  Unfinished armor and half made shields also fills this &nsmoke &+Lfilled&n

&+L   The legends must be true, can this truly be the legendary &+Gja&+gde &+Gm&+gonk&+Gey &+Lfrom&N
&+Lthe lands before time.  In the time of the Glovk, the time before time, taken&N
&+Lwas the fabled object.  Beasts of many eyes descended and stole what was never&N

&+Lto the use of the &+revil &+Lones.  &+RFl&+ra&+Rm&+re&+Rs &+Lof torment fell upon the people who dared&N

&+Lbeaton to death echo in the now darkened &+wsky&+L.  Torture turns to torment of the&N
&+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+Cs &+Lthat are now forever to be lost in the black abyss.  Winds from the past&N
&+Lblow into the present, soon to be the future, never shall mortals shed vision&N
&+Lin the dark.  Songs of suffering ring out in the Raven Realms, the dead shall&N
&+Lwalk in the light once more.  Those of the &+wunlight &+Lshall rule the world, kill&N
&+Lall who dare to even cast a stare to oppose.  Rivers of &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd &+Lflow, flickering&N
&+Ldreams of life no longer hold any meaning.  &+CSh&+Wi&+Cv&+We&+Crs &+Lslowly roll down along the&N

&+Lmemories of creatures that took up space.  Screams of lost &+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+Cs &+Lecho inside&N
&+Lyour mind, &+Rbl&+ro&+Ro&+rd &+Lof the fallen flows upon the gloomy ground.  Places that were&N
&+Lonce filled with life, now only filled with faded images from the past.  &+REyes&N
&+Lthat rage with fire, lacking only desire to destroy, torment, fear of death is&N
&+Lwhat traps them.  Genocide for all those that dare to stand in the way of the&N
&+Ldragon, blackness fills the &+wsky&+L, wings of wonder flap.  The &+yforest &+Lis nothing&N
&+Lbut a burnt remnant that is no longer the present, but shall never flicker out&N
&+Lof reality for those who lived it.  You see a figure of a proud warrior, his&N
&+Lhand grasping a sword, as you gaze closer the pictures start to come to life.&N
&+LThe dragonlord descends upon the &+Chuman&+L, the being swings his blade at the dark&N
&+Lmonster's throat.  The claymore crumbles to &+wdust &+Las it strikes its target, the&N
&+Lman is then sent to his final fatal fate.  &+gAcid&+Lic &+wstorm &+Lthat leaves nothing to&N
&+Lremember except tales from those who live the events of that day.  Your vision&N
&+Ldrifts into a world that is beyond words, the deal of the lottery is struck,&N

&+y   This hard dirt path seems to be rather well traveled.  Many footprints are&N
&+yon the ground, leading off into different directions.  The air here is pure and&N
&+yfresh, the songs of &+bbirds &+yring out loudly here.  Sounds of villagers can be&N
&+yheard seemingly from all around you.  A calm cool breeze blows here causing&N
&+ysome &+Gleaves &+yto blow past.&N

&+yA Well Traveled Path&n~
&+y   The odor of life is great and grand here.  The hauntingly beautiful songs of&n
&+bbirds &+yare carried by the majestic wind.  The sounds of villagers moving aroud&n
&+yalso invades the purity of the air.  The ground here is a very hard packed&n
&+ydirt.  The path shows signs that it is rather well traveled with broken &ntwigs&+y,&n
&+Lcrushed&n &+Gleaves&+y, and faded footprints adorning the ground.&n

&+Lthe demonic air of dreary despair.  The images &+Csh&+Wi&+Cv&+We&+Cr &+Lout of sight, winds of&N

paintings~
&+L   Three paintings hang upon the walls depicting scenes of mountains that lurk&N
&+Labove waves of &+Ggrass&+L.  The first painting shows a &+Wpeace&+Lful mountain top that a&N
&+Lgoat stands on top of.  Waves of green almost seem to sway in the wind below&N
&+Lthe creature.  The second picture shows what seems to be beings of moving and&N
&+Lperhaps living rock standing on top of a &+yrocky &+Lpeak.  Several stones roll down&N
&+Lfrom the top of the structure, captured in perpetual paused motion by who ever&N
&+Lpainted this scene.  A strange feeling of &+Wpeace &+Lwashes over you as you gaze at&N
&+Lthis &+Cfr&+Wo&+Cz&+We&+Cn &+Lmoment of time.  The destruction that shall occur according to the&N
&+Lvisions of paint has a beauty that is difficult to describe.  The land below&N
&+Lseems at &+Wpeace &+Land unsuspecting the fate that shall happen to it.  The final&N
&+Limage is of a snow peaked &+Wmountain &+Lthat over looks a &+Cfr&+Wo&+Cst &+Lravaged countryside&N
&+Lof once fertile land.  The &+Cfr&+Wi&+Cg&+Wi&+Cd &+Llands sparkle within this dimly &+clit &+Labode,&N

picture painting diabolical infinity~
&+Linto the infinity of thoughts&N
&+wAs the Darkness creeps over the Northern mountains of Norway and the silence&N
&+wreach the woods, I awake and rise...  Into the night I wander, like many nights&N
&+wbefore, and like in my dreams, but centuries ago.  Under the moon, under the&N
&+wtrees.  Into the Infinity of Darkness, beyond the light of a new day, into the&N
&+wfrozen nature chilly, beyond the warmth of the dying sun.  Hear the whispering&N
&+wof the wind, the Shadows calling...I gaze into the moon which grants me visions&N
&+wthese twelve full moon nights of the year, and for each night the light of the&N
&+wholy disciples fade away.  Weaker and weaker, one by one.  I gaze into the moon&N
&+wwhich makes my mind pure as crystal lakes, my eyes cold as the darkest winter&N
&+wnights, by yet there is a flame inside.  It guides me into the dark shadows&N
&+wbeyond this world, into the infinity of thoughts..thoughts of upcoming reality.&N
&+wIn the name of the almighty Emperor I will ride the Lands in pride, carrying&N
&+wthe Blacksword at hand, in warfare. I will grind my hatred upon the loved ones.&N
&+wDespair will be brought upon the hoping childs of happiness.  Wherever there is&N
&+wjoy the hordes of the eclipse will pollute sadness and hate under the reign of&N
&+wfear.  The lands will grow black.  There is no sunrise yet to come into the&N
&+wwastelands of phantoms lost.  May these moments under the moon be eternal.  May&N
&+wthe infinity haunt me...  In Darkness.&N

northern hordes tapestry~
&+L   This tapestry shows the mighty &+Wnorthern &+Lhordes destroying the feeble weak.&N
&+LThey seem to be &+bberserkers &+Land they are immune to almost anything they rush at&N
&+Lthe meek and they smash and destroy.  Thine eyes dilated into a mystic image of&N
&+Luntold deathless fear.  Perhaps they are on mushrooms or maybe they are just&N
&+Lthe true warriors of this realm and any other.  The battle comes to life you&N
&+Lsee the vyking horde destroying legions of lesser warriors with greater armies.&N
&+LYet they are not even a match for the true hordes of the berserker masters, not&N
&+Lthe would be zerkers that have been unleashed in many places.  These are the&N
&+Lreal deal that are the facts and not the balanced weaklings that many wish to&N
&+Lbe truth.  They slash and cut their way threw their out classed enemies, they&N
&+Lalmost seem to be having fun.  The &+Wnordic &+Bthunder &+Ldestroys all that dare to&N
&+Lstand in the path of &+rKvasir &+Land his &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd &+Lborn troops.  The mighty one can be&N
&+Lseen holding his large hammer and smashing the &+Wskulls &+Lof all those that still&N
&+Lhave life within them.  Suddenly the pictures fade back into nothingness and&N
&+Lyou realize you can never be a true berserker for you lack the &+Rbloodlust&+L.&N

&+Lof suffering echo inside your head.  Voices start to chant '&+byou shall be mine&+L'&N

bar~
&+L   This bar has been crafted from the most perfect &+Wm&+wa&+Lr&+wb&+Wle &+Lyou have ever seen.&N
&+LThe object seems as if it was just created today, no marks nor stains of any&N
&+Lkind are evident upon the sleek surface.  Scenes of war and battles long since&N
&+Lpast fade into your mind as you gaze at this item of polished perfection.  The&N
&+Lsounds of warriors locked in mortal combat rings within your head, making you&N
&+Lwish that you were &+wdead&+L.  &+RBl&+ro&+Ro&+rd &+Lof the fallen flows down swords of the slayers&N
&+Land drips down upon the demonic ground.  Reality starts to invade the now and&N
&+Ldisrupts what was perceived to you as the present.  The &+ytavern &+Lshifts back in&N
&+Las the accepted sight thought to be right.  What is real now seems to be as it&N
&+Lonce was before, visions &+wcloud &+Lthe mind no longer.&N
