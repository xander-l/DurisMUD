&+LA Narrow Ravine&N~
&+L   A narrow and dark ravine opens to the north, an ugly and confused
&+Lcollection of cliff walls and fallen rocks.  It twists and turns like a
&+Lcoiling snake, with the jagged walls jutting out at odd angles, effectively
&+Lblocking line of sight to the north.  The angles of the walls block
&+Llight from above, making the entire chasm into a collection of shadows.

&+LA Narrow Ravine&N~
&+L   The narrow, jagged ravine continues to run north and south from here,
&+Ltwisting and turning in the process.  The steep, angled cavern walls
&+Lextend for maybe one hundred feet above the floor of the chasm, nearly
&+Lblocking out the view of the sky completely.  What little light does escape
&+Linto the ravine only serves to create more shadows along the floor of the
&+Lcavern.  A stale, cool wind blows in from the north, creating odd,
&+Lhaunting harmonics as it follows the path of the chasm.

&+L   The ravine ends abruptly here, spilling out into a small, bowl-shaped
&+Lvalley.  Enshrouded in a deep, heavy grey fog, details of the clearing are
&+Limpossible to make out.  A chill wind blows briskly from the north,
&+Lchilling the bone and causing the fog to swirl in odd, chaotic patterns.
&+LThe grey mist dissipates most of the light from the sky and seems to suck
&+Lthe color out of your surroundings, making everything appear dull and
&+Ldreary to the eye.  The air here is wet and stale, despite the breeze,
&+Land it smells slightly of rotting flesh.

&+LA Barren Gorge&N~
&+L  The ground here is&n &+wgrey&n &+Land mostly barren, with some sparse&n &+ybrown&n
&+ygrasses&n &+Lpoking up through the hard packed dirt in places.  Large rounded
&+Lrocks lie strewn about the gorge, partially shrouded by the grey fog that
&+Lcovers everything like a blanket.  The air is cold and stale, and smells
&+Lof death.  In places, the stench is almost overwhelming, and the slight
&+Lbreeze that blows southwards does nothing to allieviate the smell.  High
&+Lblack cliff walls surround the small valley, ugly, forboding, and
&+Limpassible.

&+wSet into the black cliff itself is a large iron door, flanked by two
&+wmassive carved columns.  The door is flat and undecorated, marred only by
&+wthe effects of corrosion.  The columns, on the other hand, are covered
&+wwith engravings.  Unfortunately, weather has worn the two columns down too
&+wmuch and no real details of the carvings can be made out.

Worn away by weather and time, these columns were, at one time,

beside the large iron door, solemn reminders of the ravages of time and

The grey fog swirls and twists in random patterns as the cold breeze
streams down the cliffside and encounters the cavern opening in the wall.
The heavy smell of decay and death is worse in the mouth of the cave
itself.  A few feet inside the tunnel mouth is a heavy iron door which
blocks any passage further into the cave.

&+LA Barren Gorge&N~
&+L  The ground here is&n &+wgrey&n &+Land mostly barren, with some sparse&n &+ybrown&n
&+ygrasses&n &+Lpoking up through the hard packed dirt in places.  Large rounded
&+Lrocks lie strewn about the gorge, partially shrouded by the grey fog that
&+Lcovers everything like a blanket.  The air is cold and stale, and smells
&+Lof death.  In places, the stench is almost overwhelming, and the slight
&+Lbreeze that blows southwards does nothing to allieviate the smell.  High
&+Lblack cliff walls surround the small valley, ugly, forboding, and
&+Limpassible.

&+LSlabs of granite lie around the walls of the room, providing a place to
&+ylay bodies out for burial.  The room has the feel of great age to it, an

&+ware rough and jagged, pitted with holes and deep cracks.  A circular
&+Lpit opens up beneath you, plunging into the darkness below.  The smooth

A &+LDark&N Shrine~
&+R   This quiet, hidden room is roughly thirty feet across at its widest,
&+Rand has been cut in the shape of a octagon.  Near the north wall, a small
&+rset of stairs leads up to a raised altar, behind which sits a ten-foot
&+rtall statue of the goddess of death.  The stone of the altar is ice cold
&+rto the touch, enough to cause pain unless proper protection is worn.  On
&+Lthe other hand, the statue radiates warmth.  The other walls of the room
&+Lare flat and plain, with the exception of a lone carving of the death
&+Lgoddess in the middle of each.

Scawled in blood-red lettering across the walls of this circular chamber
are the words:

        &+rSo end the enemies of &+LVecna&n.

&+LThe &+rEmbalming&+L Room&n~
&+y   Dominating the central portion of this room is a gigantic vat, filled
&+ywith acrid embalming fluid.  A nasty, thin yellow liquid, the embalming fluid
&+ygives off a stench that's almost bad enough to knock a person out.  A vat
&+yis made of solid, blackened oak and is roughly thirty feet in diameter and
&+yfour feet in height.  Occasionally some solid mass will float to the
&+ysurface of the vat, and with horror you realize that the chunk of floating
&+ymatter is part of a half-decayed corpse.

&+LA Dark Anteroom&N~
&+L  This blackened chamber reeks of death and decay, and everything is
&+Lcovered with a thick layer of disguising grime.  Dust fills the air,
&+Lenough to choke a man if he inhales too much.  A rounded portalway leaves
&+Lto the north, and an undecipherable mass of runes surrounds that exit.
&+LThe runic script which outlines the portal seem to eminate a feeling of
&+Lsheer horror, as if Death himself had signed his name around the door.

&+LThe Inner Sanctuary&N~
&+L   This hidden lair of the archlich Vecna is dominated by a raised
&+wplatform near the north wall, which contains a single, massive throne made
&+Lof bone.  The throne about fifteen feet in height and composed of
&+wthousands and thousands of skulls, mostly those of small human or elven
&+Lchildren.  It glows with an unholy power and waves of sheer hatred can be
&+wfelt from this throne of Vecna.  At first glance, the walls of the chamber
&+Lappear to be flat and black, but upon closer inspection one can see the
&+wwalls have been intricately carved.  Millions upon millions of tiny
&+Lscreaming faces have been etched into the black stone, each face
&+wapparently being unique.  To the west, an odd doorway sits... odd because
&+La thin membrane of some sort fills the frame, like a thin bubble.  To the
&+weast, another chamber opens.

The Hall of Trophies~
&+y   This long hallway is lined with statues, intricately carved by some
&+yexpert craftsmen.  Each statue is carved in the likeness of a great leader
&+yof people, famous figures from throughout the past.  All have one thing in
&+ycommon: all were slain through the machinations of the archlich Vecna.
&+yHumans, drow, mountain dwarves... every race seems to be represented by at
&+yleast one fallen hero.

&+LThe Torture Chamber&N~
&+r   The room is filled with a large assortment of torture devices.  A
&+rlarge rack domintes the center of the room, and a ring of manacles hangs
&+rfrom the ceiling in the northest corner.  Various stakes, pincers,
&+rneedles, and chains lie strewn about the room haphazardly.  A few
&+rsmall knives, corroded almost beyond recognition, lie on a small
&+rpedestal near the rack.  Dried blood cakes almost everything in the room.

&+rA Deep Pool&N~
&+r   The entirety of this room is taken up by a shallow pool of deep, red,
&+rblood, roughly two feet in depth.  The pool is about twenty feet in
&+rdiameter, and eerie currents from some unknown source cause the blood to
&+Lmove slowly around the pool in a circle, as if some invisible hand was
&+Lstirring the horrid fluid.  The walls of the room are caked in blackened
&+Llayers of dried blood as well.

&+LA Bubble in Space&n~
&+b   Swirling mixes of color swirl about this room in a myriad of every
&+bchanging color.  A feeling of vast, empty space fills this room.
&+bApparently used by Vecna for watching the other planes of existance, this
&+brip in the fabric of reality is actually rather peaceful compared to the
&+brest of Vecan's lair.  A doorway lies to the east, covered in a thin,
&+btranslucent membrane.  Through this doorway Vecna's throneroom can be
&+bseen, but everything is distorted, like the colors have been washed away.
