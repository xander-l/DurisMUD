&+yA Wide Path Through a Patch of Trees&N~
&+y   The path here runs through a small patch of trees.  The heads of &N
&+yseveral caribou lie here in the snow on the side of the trail in patches&N
&+yof red, obviously the remains of a successful hunt.  The cliffs in the east &N
&+yare quite visible now and look rather impressive against the hazy winter sky.&N
&+ySnow caps the top of the cliffs, and a band around the mid-section forms &N
&+yIce Crag's Belt, a center of local folklore.  The quality of the path is still&N
&+yquite impressive considering it does'nt appear to be part of the main road.  &N
&+yThe path continues through the patch of trees to the east.&N

&+yNothing is in sight for miles to the north, while far to the south, past &N

&+ytheir true grandeur becomes apparent.  The cliffs seem to rise forever, as &N
&+yif seeking to join the heavens.  It becomes clear now, that the top of the &N
&+ycliffs are not really visible.  They are shrouded in clouds, which appeared &N
&+yto be snow from greater distances.  There is nothing on this road to speak of,&N
&+yand it is still disturbingingly well maintained.  The flatlands continue to &N

&+Lstarted to sprout up in the shelter of the cliffs, but nothing substantial.  &N
&+LSmall footprints in the snow show signs of wilflife, but again nothing of an &N

&+yThe Base of Ice Crag Cliffs&N~
&+y   The earth meets the cliffs here.  The cliffs appear to be formed by &N
&+yglacial movements, apparent from the vicious horizontal scars that mar the &N
&+yentire rock face from top to bottom.  They rise straight up, never hesitating &N
&+yin their ascent.  There are ledges and rims, but none very large.  The cliffs &N
&+ylook climbable, but its not necessary as the road continues to the north up &N
&+ythe hill that rests against the cliffs.  It looks like it's even possible to &N
&+ytake a wagon all the way to the top.  The road here continues to be well &N
&+ymaintained and free of obstruction.  To the east, there seems to be a small &N
&+yentrance to the face of the cliff, but it could just be a natural crack.&N

&+yAn Uphill Grade On the Path Up the Cliff&N~
&+y   The road here rises on a pretty steep angle.  The side of the cliff is &N
&+ynearby to the east while the hill starts to drop away to the west.  The road &N
&+yis smooth and easy to travel aside from the heavy climb.  Huge frozen water &N
&+ycascades cover the large majority of the cliff face here.  Occasionally a &N
&+ypiece breaks off and shatters on the ice covered snow below.  The road shows &N
&+ysigns of passage, though nothing in the way of wear and tear.  A few wagon &N
&+ytrails are evident in the thin snow covering that has not been cleared away &N
&+yyet.  The climb continues to the north.&N

&+yAn Uphill Grade On the Path Up the Cliff&N~
&+y   The base of the cliff gets smaller and smaller as the climb continues, and &N
&+ythe hill contiues to drop off at an exponential rate.  The sun shines brightly &N
&+yoff the frozen blue ice sheets that adorn the cliff face, making it difficult &N
&+yto see the road ahead.  It is clear however, that one of the cascades has &N
&+ygrown to such proportion that it displaces the road up ahead.  As the ice &N
&+yblock grows, it keeps pushing the road further to the west, away from the &N
&+ycliff face.  The climb continues up to the north.&N

&+yA Bend Around a Huge Ice Flow&N~
&+C   The road here bends out to the west around a huge ice flow that seems to &N
&+Crise up the side of the cliff into the clouds like a frozen waterfall.  The &N
&+Cice is deep with cold shades of blue and white all throughout.  It is not &N
&+Cquite as hard and rock like as glacial ice, and appears to be made of &N
&+Crelatively clean water.  There are large stones and pieces of rock broken off &N
&+Cthe cliff deep inside the flow.  The Ice Flow river is now visible to the &N
&+Csouth, a shining streak across the bleak landscape, an ever present reminder &N
&+Cof the powerful nature of the ice wastes, and its total indifference to the &N
&+Cplight of man.  The road continues to the west.&N

&+C   The road turns into a trail again.  It  is not quite as permanent as the &N
&+Cprevious road, almost as if someone keeps moving it westward with the movement &N
&+Cof the ice flow.  It is still manageable however, and there are no major &N
&+Cobstructions in the path.  The length of the ice flow is now apparent, it &N
&+Clooks to be only a few hundred yards long.  The view of the surrounding &N
&+Ccountryside to the west is breathtaking.  Were it not for heavy cloud cover, &N
&+Cone could probably see the shores of the Sword Coast.  The path heads up and &N

&+Cgave up rather quickly it seems.  A few large gash marks are present in the &N
&+Cice, showing that someone did indeed take sword to the matter.  Fortunately &N
&+Cthe hill does not start to drop away for another twenty feet or so to the &N
&+Cwest, so there is no danger of falling.  The approaching drop could be the &N

&+Ctowards the cliff face and south around the ice flow.  The trail starts to &N
&+Clook more like a road again here, and the going gets a little easier.  The ice &N
&+Cflow appears to be quite dirty at this end, and there are many stones and &N
&+Clarge rocks near the surface of the ice, though mud and dirt blocks sight any &N
&+Cdeeper into the ice.  The corpse of a huge pack horse lies on the trail here.  &N
&+CThe animal has a visibly broken front leg and bears a massive gash to the &N
&+Cneck, presumably a mercy blow. Blood from the neck wound forms a morbid frozen &N
&+Cpuddle next to the body.&N

horse corpse~
   The horses front leg has a visible compound fracture above the right hoof.
It is easy to understand how this could have happened on the trail around the
ice flow, considering all the rocks.  The blow to the neck appears to have two
ends, it doesn't go all the way across the neck like a sword slash.  It is
also much deeper than a sword would ever go, it looks much like an axe wound.
The corpse has not decayed yet so it can only be a day or so old, but in these
frigid temperatures there can be no telling for sure.

&+yis almost a straight drop now, as the edge of the hill this road lies on pulls &N
&+ycloser.  The vale below is no longer visible; it is hidden by a thick cloud &N
&+ycover.  The road has begun to take on more uniformity here, and appears to be &N
&+ygroomed on a regular basis.  The scrub brush growing out of the cliff face has &N
&+ybeen cut away and the cliff face cleaned of dirt and ice for several tens of &N
&+yfeet off the ground.  Leading upward and north, the road continues.&N

&+ythe road from here on out.  The snow and ice are clean swept from the road, &N
&+yaside from the inch or two from the last hour, and the face of the rock is &N
&+yfree of ice and scrub.  Leading upward and north, the road reaches the summit.&N

&+yThe Edge of Ice Crag Cliffs&N~

&+yMt. Gandar looms imperiously to the south, and if it weren't for mortal &N

&+yshines a deep black in the foreground of Gandar.  To the north the cliffs &N
&+ysurface appears to be a vast wasteland of ice and snow, except for the &N
&+ymagnificent castle in the middle of perfect nothingness.  Leading towards the &N
&+ycastle lies an immaculate road of stone laid in a carved ice path.  Flags line &N

&+C   The path leading towards the castle is obviously maintained on a daily &N
&+Cbasis.  The snow has been swept off the path, and the ice chipped away to make &N
&+Cit easy to walk over.  The stones that line the ground here have been inset &N
&+Cinto the ice and then glossed over with water to fill the gaps in between.  &N
&+CThe workmanship is comparable to the best dwarven masonry.  Flags fly from &N
&+Cashen posts in the snow every twenty feet.  Very clearly, the symbol of Auril, &N
&+Cthe Frostmaiden, can be seen embroidered on each flag, a perfectly symmetrical &N
&+Csnowflake on a brilliant blue diamond background.  The road leads northward &N
&+Ctowards the castle, and south to the edge of the Ice Crag Cliffs.&N

&+C   Why anyone would build such a castle in isolation as intense as this is &N
&+Cbeyond logic and rational.  Obviously the inhabitant is veralthy and not &N
&+Cto mention quite loyal to Auril judging from the flags.  A large path has been &N
&+Ctrodden down the side of the road in the snow.  It looks as though a large &N
&+Cgroup of people have been walking back and forth next to the road.  Why they &N
&+Cchose to walk in the snow rather than on the road is not apparent.  The road &N
&+Cleads northward towards the castle, and south to the edge of the Ice Crag &N

&+CApproaching the Castle&N~
&+C   It was not clear from the edge of the cliffs exactly how large the castle &N
&+Ctruly is, as there is nothing on the horizon with which to compare.  The walls &N
&+Cof the structure must be blindingly bright in the winter sun, as they are &N
&+Cconstructed with brilliant white transluscent stone.  If the setting were &N
&+Cdifferent, high on a lush green hillside perhaps, the castle might be a &N
&+Cbreathtaking sight.  But here, in the grip of the frostmaiden, it prompts one &N
&+Cto pull up the fur against the cold abrasive winter gusts.  The only comfort &N
&+Cthe sight of the castle provides is the promise of warmth, though one has to &N
&+Cwonder if it might not be warmer, and safer, out here.  The road leads &N
&+Cnorthward onto a bridge, and south to the edge of the Ice Crag Cliffs.&N

&+CAn Arch of Solid Ice Crossing a Strange Moat&N~
&+M   A deep blue emanates from inside the arch, somewhere near the center, &N
&+Mpulsing in unison with some unseen heart.  The arch itself stems out of the &N
&+Mice and snow on either side of the moat.  Its approximately ten feet thick at &N
&+Mthe ends where it attaches to the land, and amazingly enough, only six inches &N
&+Mthick in the middle.  The ice is very slippery and it takes a lot of effort &N
&+Mto cross the bridge safely.  Below the arch, even though the ground appears &N
&+Mto be flat here, the icy waters of the moat rush past from left to right in a &N
&+Mhorrifying torrent of ice and mist.  The water is clean and clear, however the &N
&+Mbottom of the moat is not visible.  A huge set of double doors can be seen to &N
&+Mthe north.  The immaculate road leads south towards the edge of the cliffs.&N

&+LBefore the Doors of Ice Crag Castle&N~
&+C   The majestic double doors bearing the symbol of Auril are closed and have &N
&+Cno obvious keyhole.  The grand doors open towards the bridge presumably for &N
&+Csecurity purposes.  Giant iron pins form the hinges connected directly to the &N
&+Ciron frame work of the door, which in turn is fastened to the stone by smaller &N
&+Ciron shafts driven through the frame and into the wall.  The stonework is as &N
&+Cimpressive as the walkway that leads up to the castle.  Each stone set on the &N
&+Cone below with precision to make sure no ledges are formed which could be used &N
&+Cas hand holds to climb with.  The wall rises perhaps thirty feet into the &N
&+Cbleak gray sky above.  On each of the two visible corners there are towers &N
&+Cthat rise a few floors above the rest of the castle.  All around the top of &N
&+Cthe castle, waving proudly from parapets of stone, fly banners and flags also &N
&+Cbearing the symbol of Auril, the Frostmaiden.&N

&+LEastern Guard's Walk, South Wall&N~
&+L   This hallway extends around the entire perimeter of the castle providing a &N
&+Lplace where the guards can patrol the whole castle without bothering its &N
&+Linhabitants.  The corridor is wide, but has a low ceiling which gives it a &N
&+Lcramped feeling.  Numerous torch sconces light the way through the hall and &N
&+Lleave not one shadow to lurk in.  There is a path in the center of the hall &N
&+Lworn dull by so many feet walking it over and over.  The walls are flat stone &N
&+Las is the ceiling, and both are remarkably unremarkable.  The hall is &N
&+Lcompletely devoid of decoration.  It continues to the east and the west.&N

&+LNorthern Guard's Walk, West Wall&N~
&+L   Large openings, covered by steel hatches, run the length of the outer wall &N
&+Lin this section of the guard's walk.  This is the western wall of the castle, &N
&+Land faces the most threat, next to the front wall, from assault.  Most of the &N
&+Lhatches are closed but a few are open to allow for air flow.  Along the base &N
&+Lof the outer wall, jugs are lined as far as the eye can see.  The corridor is &N
&+Lwide, but has a low ceiling which gives it a cramped feeling.  Numerous torch &N
&+Lsconces light the way through the hall and leave not one shadow to lurk in.  &N
&+LThere is a path in the center of the hall worn dull by so many feet walking it &N
&+Lover and over.  The walls are flat stone as is the ceiling, and both are &N
&+Lremarkably unremarkable.  The hall continues north and south, while an iron &N
&+Ldoor leads east.&N

&+L   This, the west wall, is in the most danger of assault.  It faces one of the &N

&+L   This room is strategically very important.  There are stairs leading up and &N

&+Lcastle was obviously very important to the castle designer considering the &N

&+Lslits cut into the stone in both exterior walls, which are currently covered &N

&+LThe Western End of the Grand Foyer&N~
&+L   A large black carpet hangs on the west wall, taking up most of the surface.&N
&+LIt appears to be an oriental design with a lot of teal and purple patterns &N
&+Ladorning the face of it.  The material is plush and warm, much like a quilt, &N
&+Lbut the stiff backing clearly identifies it as a wall drape carpet.  The &N
&+Lpurple and teal jump off the carpet as if they were alive, probably an effect &N
&+Lof the strange lighting.  All the way across the foyer, another carpet is &N
&+Lvisible on the other wall.  To the east a fountain sits in the center of the &N

&+WThe Center of the Grand Foyer&N~
&+L   A gigantic circular basin carved out of glacial ice sits flush against the &N
&+Lfloor forming the base of a fountain.  Within the basin is a hot, thick, blood &N
&+Lred substance that bubbles and steams as it swirls in a violent maelstrom, &N
&+Lpouring into an unseen drain at the bottom of the fountain.  The pool is fed &N
&+Lby a constant gush from a wound in one of the figures in the statue.  Of the &N
&+Ltwo figures in the scene, the female is far more powerful a sight.  She stands &N
&+Lwell over six feet tall, and has the build of a barbarian highlander.  &N
&+LStanding over the fallen male figure, she is wrenching her axe from his &N
&+Lsundered neck.  Unlike the basin, the figures are carved from a bluish mineral &N
&+Lrock of some sort, in stark contrast of the gushing red.&N
&+L   A chandelier hangs high in the ceiling above the fountain.  The floor is a &N
&+Lbright blue, somewhat dulled by the grim lighting, with strange white lines &N
&+Lintersecting at all sorts of geometric angles.  The cathedral ceiling rises &N
&+Lall the way to what appears to be the roof of the castle itself.  It starts &N
&+Llower on the sides and rises to a domed zenith where the vile light source &N
&+Lresides.  The grand foyer continues in all directions.&N

&+WSoutheastern Corner Of the Banquet Hall&N~
&+G   This is the table reserved for the honored guests, should Strife see fit to &N
&+Ginvite any to dine with her.  It differs from the rest of the tables in the &N
&+Ghall in several ways.  A raised section of the floor has been fabricated to &N
&+Gsit the table higher than the others, though not quite as high as the head &N
&+Gtable to the east.  It also differs in design.  The base of the table is made &N
&+Gfrom oak, a rarity in these parts, and the surface is unique as well.  It's &N
&+Gmade up of thousands of ceramic shards of many colors, pressed onto grout and &N
&+Gallowed to dry.  Once dried, it was covered over in tree sap and allowed to &N
&+Gdry again, thus forming a smooth hard table top with an inlaid mosaic.  To the &N
&+Gnorth is another table, and to the east is what looks like the head table.&N

&+Gsnowflake in the center.  There is no food on this table, just the remains of &N
&+Ga snow hare.  Someone has traced the snowflake with the blood of the hare.  A &N
&+Glarge white goblet with blue trim is the only dish on the table.  A small &N
&+Gserrated knife lies next to the carcass. The chair behind the table is modeled &N
&+Gfrom a human hand.  It protrudes out of the stone of the floor, with the palm &N
&+Gforming the seat while the fingers curve up and over forming the backrest.&N

&+yinto the south wall, over which a huge kettle sways on a horizontal bar.  A &N
&+yhearth oven is built into the west wall with a duct leading to the fire pit.  &N
&+yA large rack of pots and bread pans lines the east wall with a cooking stone &N
&+ybeneath it.  The stone is just a flat piece of slate suspended over a second, &N

&+cThe Eastern End of the East Hall&N~
&+c   This hall carries the history of the castle and all of its previous &N
&+cinhabitants.  The story is told through tapestry and painting, which leap off&N
&+cthe wall in vibrant, powerful images.  Much of the work is centered around one&N
&+cfigure, a tall woman of golden hair and ferocious build.&N
&+c   The floor here is flat and smooth, cut from large pieces of stone that must&N
&+chave been mined locally as there is no way they could have been carried very&N
&+cfar.  The ambient light is pleasantly bright and if the surrounding images&N
&+cweren't so violent, it might almost seem cheery. Modified pole-arms serve as&N
&+ctorch holders placed every twenty feet or so.  The ceiling is at least &N
&+cthirteen feet off the ground, leaving plenty of room to swing a sword.  The&N
&+chall runs west and an iron door leads east.&N

&+yare unlike that of the hall to the south.  These images are more abstract, and &N

&+Wwhole scene makes for a rather ghastly paradox.  A few shattered pieces of &N
&+Wpurple orchid litter the pristine path through the garden.  The garden &N

&+GWandering Through the Ice Garden&N~
&+G   There seems to be an ever present trail through the garden, but it follows &N
&+Gno preordained route.  A nice swath of walking area has been left in between &N
&+Gall the growth to allow travel in any direction not blocked by castle wall.  &N
&+GThe entire spectrum of color is represented in the scene, from deep greens of &N
&+Gthe leaves, to light purple raindrops frozen in time as they prepare to leap &N
&+Gfrom a tree branch.   A covered gazebo provides shelter to the west, and the &N
&+Ggarden continues to the south and east.&N

&+yA Covered Gazebo Lost Among the Frozen Flowers&N~
&+y   Framed in pine, this large gazebo provides strong shelter from the snow, &N
&+ybut not the wind.  Intertwined between the lattice work and the roof, is a &N
&+ylong vine that wraps in and out of the cross hatching circling the roof at &N
&+yleast seven times.  Every few feet on the vine, a flower of a different &N
&+yspecies grows in solitude, each encased in a delicate sheath of ice.  &N
&+yAccommodating benches line the outer edge, with central round bench facing &N
&+youtward, dominating the center of the structure.  A thin layer of ice covers &N
&+ythe whole of the construction excepting the bench surfaces which have been &N
&+ychipped clean to allow for use.  The floor has also been cleaned and swept of &N
&+ysnow.  Exits leads to the south, east, and west.&N

&+G   A sculpture of a young woman juts straight out of the snow here.  She is &N
&+Gcarved from mostly ice, but some sections look like hard pack frozen snow.  &N
&+GShe is gazing up at the sky, clothed only in a shawl of some sort.  At her &N
&+Gfeet, sitting quietly awaiting her bidding, a large dog pays her the most &N
&+Gattention he is capable of.  Although she is all alone, there is no despair on &N
&+Gher face, or sadness in her eyes.  She wears the face of love, as though &N
&+Gawaiting the return of a long absent mate.  A covered gazebo provides shelter &N

&+cThe Western End of the West Hall&N~
&+c   This hall is like the east hall, in that it shows the visual history of the&N
&+ccastle and its army.  Most of the images in this section are of a terrible&N
&+cbattle at the edge of the world.  This scene takes place in an icy vale &N
&+cbetween two great mountain peaks.  Huge white winged dragons swoop down from&N
&+cthe mountain tops bearing fearless highlanders into bloody battle.&N
&+c   Empty suits of armor, placed on a standing rack elegantly serve as torch&N
&+cholders, and give a sense of majesty to the hall.  The empty suits hold a&N
&+ctorch in one hand, and a flag staff in the other.  The ceiling is very high&N
&+chere, and banners hang down, leaving little room to swing a sword.  The hall&N
&+cruns east and an iron door leads west while a wooden door leads north.&N

&+LA Frigid Viewing Chamber&N~
&+W   The walls here are covered by a second wall of ice bricks.  Tere is a &N
&+Wdrain in the floor for when the bricks melt.  Rebuilding the ice wall must be&N
&+Wan almost daily chore, but it is necessary to maintain the frosty temperature&N
&+Wneeded to preserve the ice block standing in a protective stone case in the&N
&+Wnorth wall.  The ice block encases the body of an older woman, perhaps in&N
&+Wher late forties.  Her features are cut from harder stone than the castle&N
&+Witself, though there is no doubt of her beauty.  She has a magnificent golden&N
&+Wmane of hair that wraps over her right shoulder and rests on her breast plate.&N
&+WShe wears a full suit of sparkling blue earthstone armor that covers her from&N
&+Wneck to toe.  The armor is full plate style, allowing for maximum movement and&N
&+Wminimum weight.  The trim and plate edges are white, with a perfect white&N
&+Wsnowflake on the breast plate.  The gauntlets are made from the scales of a&N
&+WRemorhaz that have been colored blue and white.  The boots are thick white&N
&+Wyeti hide plated with colored Remorhaz scales.  There is no helmet and no&N
&+Wshield, a weapon is also missing though it does not look like she was frozen&N
&+Wwith any of these.  The only exit is to the south.&N

&+cpeople.  Men and women alike, vye for her attention, like peasants pleading&N
&+cwith an indifferent king.  Her air of impunity and arrogance makes it all the&N
&+cmore frustrating for them.  The air moves swiftly here, carrying away the&N
&+cbillowing clouds of pitch smoke that rise from the torches.  A long black line&N
&+cruns down the ceiling, marking the well traveled path of the smoke and soot.&N
&+cThe hall runs north and south, while the Grand Foyer is accessible through a&N

&+Llie throughout the scene.  A sculpture of a young woman stands in the center, &N
&+Lwith something at her feet but the foliage blocks the view.  She seems to be &N

&+G   This is the main Banquet Hall of the castle, to be used for all major &N
&+Goccasions.  Though many of the tables appear to be reserved for certain &N
&+Ggroups, this one and the one to the west do not show any signs of such &N
&+Gownership.  The table is somewhat bland, but the cloth covering it is a &N
&+Gdazzling sight.  Webs of silver traced on a white backround drive the mind &N
&+Ginsane trying to find the end.  The thin silver line of seems to have no end &N
&+Gand no beginning.  The chairs which surround the table are made from iron &N
&+Gwood covered in plush blue cushions each bearing the symbol of Auril.  There &N
&+Gare plates and glasses covering the surface with all manner of left over food &N

&+yA Destroyed Lounge&N~
&+L   This room was the victim of a force so destructive, the walls show the &N
&+Levidence of its intensity.  Huge slash marks rip across the stone walls.  A &N
&+Lfew large gouges are also present, they scar the rock two inches deep in some &N
&+Lplaces.  All the furniture has been utterly obliterated beyond all &N
&+Lrecognition. Cushion stuffing lines the floor from all the wrecked furniture.  &N

&+GA Corner In the Ice Garden&N~
&+G   The scene here is almost surrealistic.  A section of rain forest appears to &N
&+Ghave been flash frozen, and transported thousands of miles north, to this...&N
&+Gthe most desolate place in the wastes.  For what purpose remains a mystery, &N
&+Gbut it is no less magnificent.  Frozen raindrops hang for all eternity from &N
&+Gleaves that will never again taste the sun.  Snow falls upon branches that &N
&+Ghave never known anything but the kiss of warmth and balmy tropical breezes.  &N
&+GGreat vines of ivy have begun to take root and are climbing the castle walls.  &N
&+GThe garden continues to the north and west, while a door leads inside to the &N

&+W  Thick ivy runs up the trunk of numerous small trees growing out the the &N
&+Wsnow.  Everything looks out of place against the snowy backdrop.  The garden &N
&+Wis totally normal in all respects except everything is encased in a thin layer &N
&+Wof ice.  The flowers are bent slightly in one direction as if swaying from a &N
&+Wmild breeze when the arctic blast hit.  The whole scene makes for a rather &N
&+Wghastly paradox.  A section of bush has been carved into a chair here, &N
&+Wstrengthend by the frost.  What appears to be a fountain lies to the west, and &N

&+GA Frozen Fountain In the Ice Garden&N~
&+L   Amidst the frozen orchids and hibiscus, a fountain of beautiful marble &N
&+Lconstruction lies frozen in action. The fountain is a simple design with a &N
&+Lround basin on the bottom and a long thin tower in the center from which water &N
&+Lflows in all directions forming a circular waterfall.  The water arcing from &N
&+Lthe center piece to the basin below is frozen in flight forever in the icy &N
&+Lgrasp of whatever seized the forest.  A collection of droppings  on the snow &N
&+Lbeneath the fountain seem to indicate something is coming hear for water, or &N
&+Lice at least.  A gazebo lies to the north, and the icy garden is visible to &N
&+Lthe east and west.&N

&+W   If it were not for the obvious abnormalities of the surroundings, it would &N
&+Wbe quite pleasant.  But alas, the sheer strangeness of the garden cannot &N
&+Wco-exist with comfort.  A rigid bench made from bamboo trees sits sheltered &N
&+Wunder the icy bow of a eucalyptus tree, that in a warmer climate might be used &N
&+Wby young lovers.  A patch of gorgeous yellow orchids stands frozen in time in &N
&+Wa small iron arbor to the left of the path.  In between the yellow petals, a &N

&+G   Leaving the heavy brush and foliage, the garden turns to an open area here.&N
&+GDigging down beneath the snow, it becomes apparent that this is the beginning&N
&+Gof a sandy beach.  Conch shells stick out of the snow, covered in sand. A&N
&+Glarge piece of drift wood leans up against the castle wall, where the water&N
&+Gwould have been.  Turned upside down and heavily cracked, a giant sea turtle&N
&+Gshell juts up out of the deeper frost near the corner of the garden, &N
&+Gapparently the new home of a young snow vulture.  Further away from the &N
&+Gshoreline, a majestic coconut tree rises out of a pile of shattered coconuts,&N
&+Gstretching towards the sun it will never see again.  The garden continues to&N

&+cforces of one side, dressed in blue, seem to be gaining the edge over the&N
&+cothers but victory is not yet at hand.  Up above the main battlefield, a few&N

&+LA Frosty Throne Room in the Court of the Icess&N~
&+W   This room is covered in frost from floor to ceiling.  Not one piece of &N
&+Wstone is visible through the frost and ice.  A comfortable looking throne &N
&+Wcovered in white, furry, yeti hides rests against the center of the back wall. &N
&+WIt has large furry armrests covered in the skin of the arm so that the hand &N
&+Wclaws stick out at the end, and a similar foot rest at the bottom.  A huge &N
&+Wstuffed white dragon head is attached to the top of the throne forming the &N
&+Wheadpiece.  The head is nearly the size of the whole throne, and the fangs, &N
&+Wthe size of a small sword.  A narrow red carpet leads from the pedastal to the&N
&+Wsouth, all the way up to the throne.  Sprinkled all along the carpet are what &N
&+Wappear to be frozen black orchid petals.&N

&+Lproclaiming its presence with authority.  The white hot flame, changes color &N
&+Lperiodically, changing from bright white through all the shades of gray, and &N

onyx pedestal~
   This pedestal must be from another world, no living creature on this plane
could have created so evil an object.  Its very appearance exudes fear and

at.

flame~
   As the flame changes color, a vision is noticeable within the flame itself.
Huge pillars of ice, a bloody altar carved out of the frost, gargantuan
humanoid blocks of walking ice, and most stunning, a vision of a breathtaking
golden haired woman sheathed in a suit of shimmering blue holding a bloody
saw-toothed war axe up to the heavens.

&+GThe Northeastern Corner of the Court of the Icess&N~
&+G   This is the Court of the Icess.  At the north end of this court sits her &N
&+Gthrone, where she spends very little time these days.  The ceiling here is &N
&+Ghigher than average, but not cathedral proportions.  Ambient light is provided &N
&+Gfrom a white hot flame atop an onyx pedestal in the center of the court.  The &N
&+Gfloor here is devoid of symbols unlike most of the castle.  The walls however &N
&+Gdo have banners bearing the symbol of Auril, but they are smaller than others &N
&+Gin the castle.  It is apparent that this room is dedicated to someone other &N
&+Gthan the goddess Auril.  The court continues to the west and south.  A door &N
&+Gleads to the north, and an arched portal leads east to the West Hall.&N

&+LA Frigid Viewing Chamber&N~
&+W   The walls here are covered by a second wall of ice bricks.  There is a &N
&+Wdrain in the floor for when the bricks melt.  Rebuilding the ice wall must be &N
&+Wan almost daily chore, but it is necessary to maintain the frosty temperature &N
&+Wneeded to preserve the ice block standing in a protective stone case in the &N
&+Wnorth wall.  The ice block encases the body of an younger woman, perhaps in &N
&+Wher early thirties.  Her features are soft and subtle, though a force of &N
&+Wundeniable malevolence dwells beneath the surface of her beauty.  She has a &N
&+Wmagnificent golden mane  hair that wraps over her right shoulder and rests &N
&+Won her breast plate.  She wears a full suit of sparkling blue earthstone armor &N
&+Wthat covers her from neck to toe.  The armor is full plate style, allowing for &N
&+Wmaximum movement and minimum weight.  The trim and plate edges are white, with &N
&+Wa perfect white snowflake on the breast plate.  The gauntlets are made from &N
&+Wthe scales of a Remorhaz that have been colored blue and white.  The boots are &N
&+Wthick white yeti hide plated with colored Remorhaz scales.  There is no helmet &N
&+Wand no shield, a weapon is also missing though it does not look like she was &N
&+Wfrozen with any of these.  The only exit is to the south.&N

&+cflame and rage, deep chasms that delve far into the belly of the planet, and&N
&+cmountaintops so high the clouds rest at the mid section.  As the corner of the&N
&+chall approaches, the air starts to move even faster towards the large vent in&N

&+cfast moving river of black. The hall runs north and south.&N

&+cThe East Hall&N~
&+c   This area of the hall is dedicated to one battle in particular.  Several&N
&+csketches show the sequence of events that unfolded when a horde of men in black&N
&+cswarmed the castle.  The first image shows the approach of the men in black,&N
&+cthey spill out onto the surface of the cliffs from the road leading down.  In&N
&+cthe next picture, they are scaling the walls using ropes they have tossed over&N
&+cthe parapets.  Strangely enough, the perspective of the pictures is from a&N
&+cpoint about fifty feet above the castle walls.  In the last picture, a melee&N
&+censues on the roof in which the forces of the castle guard clash with the&N
&+cinvaders.  In the center of the battle, amid piles of bodies, stands the&N
&+cfaceless woman in blue.  Her body gripped with battle rage, she wipes the &N
&+cblood from her brow and leaps towards another hapless raider.  The hall runs &N

&+cThe West Hall&N~
&+c   A twelve foot tapestry depicting a battle covers the northern wall, &N
&+cbut the conflict displayed is not human.  High in an icy pass, atop a &N
&+csmall ledge, two adult white dragons begin their courtship ritual.  &N
&+cLegend has it, the male must subdue the female by slapping his wings &N
&+cagainst her in an effort to force her cooperation.  She is quite resistant,&N
&+cand has gotten hold of his neck.  Hot blood drips down his back, and freezes&N
&+con the snow below.  In the end the male will triumph, and the wound is on&N
&+cly superficial. The resistance is only to convince the male that she &N
&+cwill bear strong young.  He is so confident, he has built his ice cave&N
&+cfor the eggs already, the entrance is just below the ledge.  The hall&N
&+cruns east and west, while a door leads north.&N

   &+W"The Garden of Love"&N by William Blake

   I went to the garden of love,
and saw what I had never seen.
   A chapel was built in the midst,
where I used to play on the green.

   And the doors of this chapel were shut,
and &+R'thou shalt not writ'&N across the door.
   So I turned to the garden of love,
that so many sweet flowers bore.

   And I saw that it was filled graves,
and tombstones where flowers should be.
   And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,
binding with briars my joys and desires.

Funny Joke Adapted From Tv For Sojourn&N~
   Theres three Pc's sitting on a bench in Balder's Gate.  One is an elf,
one is a dwarf, and one is a human.  The human is looking around to see
who is going to try and rob him, and just as he thinks the elf is going
to attack, he notices an old lamp under the bench.  Taking interest as
well, the elf forestalls his plans for a bit.  The human reaches down to
pick up the lamp, but the dwarf casts him a furtive glance and says,
"Thats mine human, leave it be."  Not wishing to have two enemies the
human gives up his claim and leans back against the bench.  The dwarf,
now thoroughly excited picks up the lamp and begins to rub the lamp with
mad abandon.  Successfully achieving only a shiny spot, he gives up and
tosses the lamp over his shoulder.  The elf quickly leaps over the bench
and grabs it up off the ground.  Grinning slyly, he seats himself down
and non-chalantly pops the lid off the lamp.  Lo and behold, a giant
djinn flies out of the lamp, cackling at the top of his lungs.  After a
few minutes of galavanting around the bench, the djinn says "I am so
happy, I will grant each of you 1 wish!"  The elf quickly claims title to
all three wishes since he was the one who opened the lamp, but the djinn
will hear of no such thing.  So the three ponder possibilites for five
minutes or so and the djinn prompts them to make a decision as he has
some relatives in the Calimshan Desert he has'nt seen in two centurys.
  The elf says "I wish only that all of my people return to the homeland
that we may live in peace and harmony, away from all these outsiders."
  In a flash of magic and light, the elf disappears along with all of
the other elves passing in the street.
  Thoroughly impressed, the dwarf says "I wish only that all of my people
return to our homeland that we may live in peace and harmony away from
all these outsiders."
  Once again the djinn calls upon the ancient ones and in a dazzling
display of blue smoke and fire, the dwarf disappears along with all the
other dwarves passing on the street.
  The djinn smiles at the human and says "You are the only one left, what
is your wish?"
  The human grins and says, "Let me get this straight, all the elves are
on Evermeet, and all the Dwarves are in Mithrill hall right?"
  The djinn nods his giant head and says "Correct."

Please 'look punchline' to see it:)

Rare Mobile Loading Room&N~
   These are mobiles that only enter the game on rare occasions.  They
will have eq designed to stay _very_ rare.  Most will sneak and hide to
aid in keeping the secret.  Mobiles will have a 1 in 6 chance of
escaping the initial load room.  If they fail, they will either DT and be
recycled upon reset, or they will enter a no-exit room thus removing them
from the game for the entirety of that boot.  If they escape, they will
have another 1 in 6 chance of escaping to a distribution room.  If not
they will suffer the same fate as noted above.

&+yedge into the turbulent moat below.  The immaculate road leading south towards &N
&+ythe edge of Ice Crag cliffs can be seen all the way to the end, it cuts the &N
&+yicy wastes in two.  The land drops away into what looks like a vale at the far &N

&+Lhas been in disuse for what seems a century.  Inches upon inches of black dust &N
&+Ldrape over everything in site, and massive cobwebs give it the appearance of a &N
&+Lgiant spider nest.  After clearing away a little of the dust, it becomes &N
&+Lapparent that when it was built, the guard's walk had a polished stone floor &N
&+Lmuch like the rest of the castle. It has just been worn off by so many feet &N
&+Lpassing over.  The sconces that sit on the wall have never been used, and the &N
&+Llamps that dangle every twenty feet have never tasted oil.  To the east and &N
&+Lwest, the guards walk continues.&N

&+LA Nauseating Preparation Room&N~
&+G   A cold metal table top rests upon a slab of rock in the middle of this &N
&+Groom.  Resting upon the slab is the devastated, and desecrated body of an &N
&+Gelven warrior.  He was a powerful man in his day, but all that is left is an &N
&+Gemaciated, disembowled corpse.  Clear liquids drain from the body and flow &N
&+Ginto a hole in the corner of the table, all the blood left the body long ago.  &N
&+GA table of gruesome knives and saws stands next to the table, readily within &N
&+Greach.  There is a strong acrid smell in the air, presumably the agent used in &N
&+Gpreserving the corpse.  The room continues to the north.&N

body elf warrior elven~
   The elf was once a powerful warrior, there is no doubt because of the
battle scars that adorn his face and chest.  He met his match in who ever
dealt the catastrophic blow to his neck, which nearly cleaved him in two.  His
head and neck have been expertly sewn back on for cosmetic purposes, it
appears he is being stuffed and mounted.  All his internal organs have been
removed through a large cut underneath the rib cage, and his body cavity
scraped out and filled with wood chips and cloth.  The eyes were also removed
and replaced with glass spheres, yet to be painted.  His skin is a sickly
palid green.

&+WEastern End of An Elegant Marble Gallery&N~
&+C   Mirror polished marble slabs of a magnificent gray and white, have been &N
&+Cperfectly cut and fit to form the floor of the majestic gallery that spans &N
&+Cfrom one side of the castle to the other.  The sheer size of the hall makes it &N
&+Cfeel like an open field.  Marvelous mahogony banisters run the length of the &N
&+Chall on both sides, and the walls are paneled in the same fashion from the &N
&+Cfloor up to the varnished rails.  The rest of the wall, from the banister to &N
&+Cthe ceiling, is sectioned marble slabs like the floor.  A thick, plush red &N
&+Ccarp stretches from end to end, forming a narrow walkway down the hall, to &N
&+Cprotect the perfect sheen of the floor.  The wood rails are varnished with a &N
&+Cdeep almond stain that bears not a scratch or a blemish.  No dust has been &N

&+L   This post in the narrow corridor from the Viscounts office, is the main &N
&+Lcheckpoint before the treasury vault.  There are iron spikes protruding from &N
&+Lthe wall, floor and ceiling making it extremely treacherous to enter this &N
&+Larea.  The spikes are designed to make a rush assault on the post a sure fire &N
&+Lfailure.  The spikes extend three to four feet towards the center of the hall, &N
&+Lmaking the only passable spot in the hall easily defended two feet wide.&N
&+LBurning braziers light the hall with a fiery glow from behind the spikes.  &N

tall from base to tip.  The structure is perfectly symmetrical, with limbs

&+ybuilt into the east wall, it holds all manner of training weapons.  Rolled up &N
&+yin the northeastern corner lies a tumbling mat, for use in training.  Large &N

&+WThe West Wing of an Elegant Marble Gallery&N~
&+C   Many hours have been spent cleaning and preparing the Gallery to look this &N
&+Cmagnificent.  Each and every surface has been carefully dusted, wiped, and &N
&+Cpolished.  One would think it was being prepared for guests, but the hall is &N
&+Cscarcely used from the looks of it.  There are no footprints or disruptions in &N
&+Cthe knap of the carpet, even near the doors.  If it is used at all, the carpet &N
&+Cmust be re-combed several times a day to remove any sign of use.  All of the &N
&+Ccastles facilities on this floor can be reached through the gallery, in fact &N
&+Cmost of them require passing through it to reach them.  In the southwest &N
&+Ccorner lies the castles archives, and in the northwest lies the second floor &N
&+Cof the barracks.  To the northeast is the massive round table where Strife and &N
&+Cher leadership make plans and discuss matters of the castle, and finally in &N

&+yhere, it contains a handfull of dying orchids drooping off to one side.  They &N
&+yare perhaps the only spot of color in the whole of the archives.  The air is &N
&+ymusty with a hint of wood and leather.  The air is kept moving with vents all &N
&+yalong the ceiling and floor in an effort to keep the pages dry, and for the &N
&+ymost part it works.  Most of the books look like they are pretty well kept, &N
&+yand do not suffer from dry rot.  Every few shelves however, at least one or &N

&+ydescribing various types of wildlife from birds to fish cover the shelves and &N
&+ytables in a frenzy of information.  Papers on the reproductive habits of the &N
&+ysandworms of the Calimshan desert, articles on the mating rituals of tribal &N

&+LAt the Zenith of the Grand Foyer&N~
&+L   From this vantage point, the design of the floor becomes all to clear.  The &N
&+Lconfusing white lines that intersect at all manner of geometric angles form a &N
&+Lgiant symmetrical snowflake, that lies on the blue diamond background.  It is &N
&+Lthe grandest symbol of Auril in the castle.  The fountain can be seen directly &N
&+Ldown from here, and all the rooms of the foyer can be reached by flying down &N
&+Lalong the arched ceiling.  The grotesque bone chandelier visible from below, &N
&+Lis even more repulsive up close.  Human, and a large array of giant humanoid &N
&+Lbones were used to construct this sculpture of decay.  It uses mostly leg and &N
&+Larm bones, with the occasional rib for spires and spikes.  It resembles &N
&+Lnothing familiar, which in and of it self is disturbing.  In the center of the &N
&+Lbones, is an inverted skull which holds a half melted, nauseating candle.  The &N
&+Llight it creates is a horrid grayish black that creeps through the air with a &N

&+yThe Final Display in the Trophy Hall&N~
&+y   This display is the last moments in the life of an unknown soul.  The rack &N
&+ywhich will hold the mounting is as of yet unfilled.  The scene is set in a &N
&+ydark and shady castle hallway.  There is a guard on either side of the hall, &N
&+yboth nearly torn in half by horrific blows to the mid section.  They lie &N
&+ycrumpled on the floor like broken dolls.  One of the mountings is finished, &N
&+ybut it is not the main subject.  The finished mounting is of a heroic young &N
&+yhuman, leaping to the aid of the unknown companion.  He springs through the &N
&+yair with one bent leg forward, and the other leg swept straight back.  His &N
&+yhands clutch a mighty battle axe raised high above his right shoulder.  A &N
&+ydeafening roar of silence emerges from his lips, his last battle cry before &N
&+ymeeting his match.  Apparently his rescue attempt was only succesful for a &N
&+ymoment, as a large slash wound slides across his lower back, probably a &N
&+ysevered spine.  The trophy hall ends here, the only exits are back through &N
&+ythe displays and west through a one way shutter door.&N

&+C   The attention to detail in the hall is disturbing.  Why anyone would spend &N
&+Cso much time to clean even the slightest of corners in a hall, even one as &N
&+Cgrand as this, is beyond rational.  The fixtures used to hold the railings up &N
&+Chave even been polished so the brass shines like a mirror.  The narrow carpet &N
&+Cthat runs the center of the hall has been layed in sections, so dirty pieces &N
&+Ccan be removed for cleansing without disturbing the rest of the gallery.  Even &N
&+Cthe wood paneling on the walls has been polished with stain oil to darken the &N
&+Cgrain and protect the finish.  The gallery continues to the east and west.&N

&+Lcliffs.  The castle is in the center of the map, and the road leading up the &N
&+Lcliff lies in the southern portion.  Off to the east there is a path leading &N

&+cSouthwestern Section of a Massive Round Table&N~
&+L   The ceiling rises to a higher level here, and the room seems to extend for &N
&+Lsome distance to the east and north.  Several doors can be seen a ways to the &N
&+Lnorth, set equidistantly along the northern wall.  A huge sheet of rock that &N
&+Lmust be sixty feet long rests atop large blocks of stone here, forming a &N
&+Lmassive round table.  The surface of the sheet has been ground smooth and &N
&+Lslightly polished for use as a table top.  Surrounding the table are large &N
&+Lgothic style chairs with high backs and soft red cushions.  In the center of &N
&+Lthe table, firmly anchored to the stone, is a crystalline snowlflake glowing &N
&+Lfom the inside.  The light is pleasantly dim here, provided by candlabras &N
&+Lsuspended from the ceiling with reflectors to keep the upper half of the room &N
&+Lin shadow.  The room feels very neutral, the air does not seem to move, and &N
&+Lthere is not a sound from anywhere.  Silken banners of blue and white, hang in &N
&+Lshadow on the wall, displaying the symbol of Auril.  The round table continues &N

&+Cthe southeast is Strife's personal tropy room, where she displays her proudest &N
&+Cmoments of violence.  The gallery continues to the east and west, and a lovely &N
&+Ccarved wood door leads south.&N

&+WThe West Wing of an Elegant Marble Gallery&N~
&+C   The red carpet widens here, allowing more access to the sides of the &N
&+Cgallery.  Less lighting gives the marble a darker appearance here, and &N
&+Ccombined with the reflections of the red carpet, it has almost a purple shade &N
&+Cto it.  The temperature is noticeably higher towards the center of the &N
&+Cgallery, probably because its the highest point in the castle, aside from the &N
&+Ctowers.  Up ahead a staircase can be seen on the north side of the gallery, &N
&+Cleading where however is unknown.    The gallery continues to the east &N
&+Cand west.&N

&+WThe Midpoint of an Elegant Marble Gallery&N~
&+C   This is almost the perfect geometric center of the castles upper floor.  &N
&+CThis is the halfway point in the gallery, which stems off the north/south &N
&+Cguards walk very near the center.  The red carpet covers the entire floor &N
&+Chere, leaving just the edges of the marble peeking through at the base of the &N
&+Cwalls.  Empty suits of plate armor stand against the south and north walls, &N
&+Ceach bearing a smouldering brazier in its hands.  The scented smoke drifts up &N
&+Ctowards the ceiling where it mixes with the torch smoke from the rest of the &N
&+Cgallery.  Hanging from the ceiling, unstained by the pitch smoke, a blue silk &N
&+Cbanner with a snowflake in the center provides the only artistic decoration &N
&+Cthe hall has to offer.  The gallery continues to the east and west, and a &N
&+Cvelvet covered staircase lies to the north.&N

&+WThe East Wing of an Elegant Marble Gallery&N~
&+C   The attention to detail in the hall is disturbing.  Why anyone would spend &N
&+Cso much time to clean even the slightest of corners in a hall, even one as &N
&+Cgrand as this, is beyond rational.  The fixtures used to hold the railings up &N
&+Chave even been polished so the brass shines like a mirror.  The narrow carpet &N
&+Cthat runs the center of the hall has been layed in sections, so dirty pieces &N
&+Ccan be removed for cleansing without disturbing the rest of the gallery.  Even &N
&+Cthe wood paneling on the walls has been polished with stain oil to darken the &N
&+Cgrain and protect the finish.  The gallery continues to the east and west, and &N
&+Ca pale green door heads south.&N
