   Characterized by lightness and insubstantialiy the ethereal
plane lives up to its name.  Bodily forms and other shapes
fade in and out of view from other dimensions and planes of
existence, seemingly always out of reach.  There are small
debris floating weightless through the ethereal.  The space

fade in and out of view from other dimensions and planes of
existence, seemingly always out of reach.  There are small
debris floating weightless through the ethereal.  The space

   Characterized by lightness and insubstantialiy the ethereal
plane lives up to its name.  Bodily forms and other shapes
fade in and out of view from other dimensions and planes of

debris floating weightless through the ethereal.  The space
here is filled with a light-grayish hue that extends in all
