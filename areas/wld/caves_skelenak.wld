Huge Cave Entrance~
   A large cave boroughs into the rocky wall here, from which a foul odor
emanates.  The cave mouth is about thirty feet in diameter, and appears
to be a natural feature of the rock, rather than a man-made structure.
There is a *large* sign fastened to the wall of the cave mouth here.

Goblin Hall~
   This large squared corridor continues to the west for some distance.
It's construction is poor, with the walls and floor uneven and cracked,
definitely not the work of the dwarves who originally mined here.
Dozens of small, crude carvings cover the walls depicting goblins in
many different scenes.  Some of the carvings show goblins killing orcs
and humans, others of more regal looking goblin leaders or chiefs.
Small openings lead off to the north, east, and south of here.

Damp Cave~
   A large pool of water dominates the center of this forty foot wide
cave, filling the air with a thick humidity.  The walls all look wet from
condensation, and an occasional dripping sound can be heard as water
collects on the ceiling and falls into the pool below.  The cave continues
to the east.

Damp Cave~
   There are several small pools of stagnant water in this section of the
damp cave.  Condensation covers the walls giving them a 'wet' look, and
water drips down from the ceiling above making eerie splashing noises.

Great Cavern~
   This cavern reaches up literally hundreds of feet, almost beyond
the range of normal vision.  At the very top a shaft of sunlight cuts
into the darkness from a small hole.  Dozens of tiny ledges protrude
from the walls of this immense cavern.  There is also huge opening
in the floor here, where the great cavern continues downwards.  The
air here is very thick with moisture and the smell of minerals.

   I have traveled the Underworld far and wide, and seen more horrible and
wretched monsters down in these caves then any on the surface world.  Be
warned brave and noble traveler, this underworld can deliver a swift and
merciless death to any but the strong of heart, and great of power.  Do not
proceed down this river unless you yourself can defeat these powerful beasts,
for I have seen them and what they can do.  While I myself have felled many
of the foul things, I have achieved the highest level of fighting ability,
and still almost died on more than one occasion!  I suggest you not travel
alone, for it may make the journey less perilous...

&+yA Rubble-Filled Cave-In~
   &+yThis cave is full of rubble from what appears to have been
&+ynumerous, and dangerous, cave-ins throughout the years.
&+yThis area is surprizingly well-traveled, as there are
&+ysigns of disturbance in the rocky floor and the surrounding
&+yarea.

A Small Cave~
   This small cave rests at the very bottom of the gorge's drop to
the east.  A burnt area on the cave floor suggests that this area
was once used as a camping location for what could be a passing
adventurer.  There is much rubble and debris in this cave, suggesting
the possibility of numerous cave-ins in the surrounding area.

The Bottom of a Deep Gorge&N~
   This deep gorge, resting at the bottom of a narrow mountain
pass through these great northern mountains, opens up to a small
cave just west of here.  There are numerous insects, mostly
beetles, crawling about the area.  The only life in the surrounding
area besides these common insects are small patches of moss and
brief bits of fungus on the more moist portions of the gorge
walls.

moss plantlife.  Numerous small, insignifigant beetles and other
insects are seen crawling about this fertile, yet remote gorge

&+yAtop a large rock~
&+w  A well worn top of a giant rock, this place allows for a great and scenic
&+wview on the surrounding area. All around, the scenery is filled with mountains,
&+wwith two especially interesting ones being just south and north of here.
&+wThe mountain to the south looms close by, its side pocketed with cave openings.
&+wTo the north, a dark forest can be seen nearby the mountain base.
&+wJust below this rock, a path seems to be leading north and south of here.
&+wThe only exit from the place seems to be down, and one need to be really
&+wcareful to avoid slipping when going that way.
