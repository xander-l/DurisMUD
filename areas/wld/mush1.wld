&+MAn Opening in the Tunnel~
&+m  The cave opens up here, displacing a huge mushroom forest that
&+mstretches throughout this region of the underdark.  The mushrooms
&+mrange in color from violet, to dark blue, to white.  It appears that
&+mmany of the creatures of the underdark have taken it upon themselves
&+mto make their homes within the mushroom forest due to the fact that
&+mthere is an over abundance of food, and more importantly because
&+mit is very easy to get lost in the mushroom forest.

&+MInside the Great Mushroom Forest~
&+m  The great mushroom forest is like the central feature at this
&+mdepth of the underdark.  The majority of the creatures of the region
&+mflock here to make their homes, gather food, or hunt.  There is a
&+ma large river that flows through the mushroom forest, providing
&+mthe moistness of the area.  The mushrooms range from barely an inch
&+mtall to over eight feet tall.  Fungi of all kinds grow upon the
&+mground so much that any path that might exist within the forest is
&+measily overgrown within a day or so.  Every now and then, a mushroom
&+mcan be seen that has grown around an old corpse, or a set of rusty
&+marmor in such a way that it catches the eye of anyone in the area.
&+mThese oddities in the mushroom forest are rare, and usually serve
&+mas guiding points for anyone that ventures within the area.

&+MInside the Great Mushroom Forest~
&+m  The great mushroom forest is like the central feature at this
&+mdepth of the underdark.  The majority of the creatures of the region
&+mflock here to make their homes, gather food, or hunt.  There is a
&+ma large river that flows through the mushroom forest, providing
&+mthe moistness of the area.  The mushrooms range from barely an inch
&+mtall to over eight feet tall.  Fungi of all kinds grow upon the
&+mground so much that any path that might exist within the forest is
&+measily overgrown within a day or so.  Every now and then, a mushroom
&+mcan be seen that has grown around an old corpse, or a set of rusty
&+marmor in such a way that it catches the eye of anyone in the area.
&+mThese oddities in the mushroom forest are rare, and usually serve

&+MInside the Great Mushroom Forest~
&+m  The great mushroom forest is like the central feature at this
&+mdepth of the underdark.  The majority of the creatures of the region
&+mflock here to make their homes, gather food, or hunt.  There is a
&+ma large river that flows through the mushroom forest, providing
&+mthe moistness of the area.  The mushrooms range from barely an inch
&+mtall to over eight feet tall.  Fungi of all kinds grow upon the
&+mground so much that any path that might exist within the forest is
&+measily overgrown within a day or so.  Every now and then, a mushroom
&+mcan be seen that has grown around an old corpse, or a set of rusty
&+marmor in such a way that it catches the eye of anyone in the area.

&+MInside the Great Mushroom Forest~
&+m  The great mushroom forest is like the central feature at this
&+mdepth of the underdark.  The majority of the creatures of the region
&+mflock here to make their homes, gather food, or hunt.  There is a
&+ma large river that flows through the mushroom forest, providing
&+mthe moistness of the area.  The mushrooms range from barely an inch
&+mtall to over eight feet tall.  Fungi of all kinds grow upon the
&+mground so much that any path that might exist within the forest is
&+measily overgrown within a day or so.  Every now and then, a mushroom
&+mcan be seen that has grown around an old corpse, or a set of rusty
&+marmor in such a way that it catches the eye of anyone in the area.
&+mThese oddities in the mushroom forest are rare, and usually serve

&+MInside the Great Mushroom Forest~
&+m  The great mushroom forest is like the central feature at this
&+mdepth of the underdark.  The majority of the creatures of the region
&+mflock here to make their homes, gather food, or hunt.  There is a
&+ma large river that flows through the mushroom forest, providing
&+mthe moistness of the area.  The mushrooms range from barely an inch
&+mtall to over eight feet tall.  Fungi of all kinds grow upon the
&+mground so much that any path that might exist within the forest is
&+measily overgrown within a day or so.  Every now and then, a mushroom
&+mcan be seen that has grown around an old corpse, or a set of rusty
&+marmor in such a way that it catches the eye of anyone in the area.
&+mThese oddities in the mushroom forest are rare, and usually serve
&+mas guiding points for anyone that ventures within the area.

&+LWithin a Secret Cave~
&+L  This cave seems to be the home of a vicious drow, who has escaped
&+Lthe savage ghetto which he was brought up on and now lives in solitude
&+Lin the mushroom forest.  He has many battle scars, and it is rumored
&+Lthat he was responsible for the death of the dragon above.  He wears
&+Lthe signet patches of the warriors guild, and has decorated the cave
&+Laccordingly.  There are charred remains of many skeletons of just about
&+Lall the races of the realm lying around the cave, as he has fought for
&+Lthe protection of this area many times.
