   The climate of this rather strange area is extremely humid.  The
area seems to be stuck in a perpetual twilight and no source of light
can be seen, yet the light level appears to be constant.  A grey mist
obscures any sight for more than a few yards, and whilst no ground
can be seen, the void upon which seems to be everywhere supports
weight.  A sense of dread and the smell of death is almost over
whelming, coupled with movement that can be seen reflected upon the
mist.

   The climate of this rather strange area is extremely humid.  The
area seems to be stuck in a perpetual twilight and no source of light
can be seen, yet the light level appears to be constant.  A grey mist
obscures any sight for more than a few yards, and whilst no ground
can be seen, the void upon which seems to be everywhere supports
weight.  A sense of dread and the smell of death is almost over
whelming, coupled with movement that can be seen reflected upon the
mist.

the dragons to enter under normal circumstances, it provides the only

   The climate of this rather strange area is extremely humid.  The
area seems to be stuck in a perpetual twilight and no source of light
can be seen, yet the light level appears to be constant.  A grey mist
obscures any sight for more than a few yards, and whilst no ground
can be seen, the void upon which seems to be everywhere supports
weight.  A sense of dread and the smell of death is almost over
whelming, coupled with movement that can be seen reflected upon the
mist.
