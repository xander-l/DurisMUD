&+LEntrance to the Clawed Caverns&N~
&+L   The infamous clawed caverns lie to the north, jagged stalagtites hang down&N
&+Lfrom the roof of the cavern to meet at times with the stalagmites that have&N
&+Ltried to reach the cavern ceiling from the floor.  The uneven floor and all the&N
&+Lwalls and stones of the cavern are lined with various veins of stone.  Mostly&N
&+Lquartz but various different colored crystalline stones can be seen as well. &N
&+LThe cavern winds to the north and the intricate caves and passages of the &N
&+Lunderdark lie to the south.&N

&+LA Twisted Juncture&N~
 &+L  The cavern extends in every direction, but the only routes that can be &N
&+Lsafely traveled lie to the east, west and south.  The clawed caverns recieved&N
&+Ltheir names from the long stalagites and stalagmites that make the entire cave&N
&+Lappear to be full of grasping claws.  The fact that a number of umber hulks&N
&+Lonce fed on the crystals and gems that could be found here helped the cavern&N
&+Lkeep its name.  Umber hulks are rarely seen here now though, then so are &N
&+Ltravelers of any type.  Faint light from various crystals growing throughout &N
&+Lthe cavern are both a help and a hindrance.  The faint light aids those with&N
&+Lultravision, allowing them to see further, but also creates shadows that can&N
&+Lbe used by dangerous creatures to surprise unwitting victims.&N

&+LNear a &+WCrystal Grove&N~
   Long, thin crystals have been growing in large clumps to the north and east,
their growth is almost tree-like.  The crystals have no branches, they simply
grow straight upward.  It is clear even from here that the crystals are often
harvested, though who by and for what purpose is quite unclear.  Faint green
and &+mviolet crystals&N are intermixed with clear &+Wwhite crystals&N and crystals
with a faint &+yamber&N hue adding a wide spread of color to the otherwise drab
darkness of the underdark.

&+LA &+gCr&+Gys&+Wtal Grove&N~
   Crystals with a faint green hue grow straight and tall, some almost ready
for harvesting, by whoever or whatever has been clearing the largest ones
away.  The crystals have been planted in even rows, or at least appear to be.
It would be hard to imagine crystals growing in such even rows completely at
random.  The crystal grove extends to the east and a cavern can be seen to the
south.  A number of massive stalagmites prevent passage through to the north
where the glow of additional crystals can be seen.

   Squat, violet-hued crystals grow in neat, even rows here.  Someone has been
cultivating the crystals, encouraging them to grow somehow.  The crystals
themselves have a faint magical aura to them, something about the cavern or the
way they have been deliberately grown has given them some mysterious magical
quality.  Additional crystals can be seen growing to the south and west, and
the faint light of other crystals and gems illuminates the cavern with a faint
glow.  Large stalagites have hung down from the ceiling to block the way north
and some particularily large crystals have cut off any travel to the east.

   Wide, but flat, amber crystals are being grown here.  The even rows have
been brutally disrupted by some sort of violence.  Blood covers the shards of
broken crystal that lie scattered about the area, most likely blood from the
dead umber hulk that lies impaled on some of the crystals that it appears to
have been eating when it was attacked.   More crystals can be seen to the north
and more plain caverns continue to the south and west.

   A thin vein of dark green stone can be seen in the western wall of the
cavern traveling right along the juncture with the floor.  The green stone is
hard to identify, but it appears to be somewhat harder and more resistant to
erosion than the granite walls of the cavern.  Crystals can be seen glimmering
 to the north and there is a faint glow throughout all the cavern.  The cavern
continues to the south and a crystal grove can be seen to the north.

   Unlike the groves of crystals growing throughout the clawed caverns, these
crystals are of every color and hue, passing through every part of the

they grow so thickly that the mound has become an impossible barrier.  The

   The massive stalagmite that rises up to the northwest is studded with a
number of tiny emeralds.  Though there are many emeralds studding the wall,
few of them look easy to displace, it is as if they have been magically welded
to the stalagmite itself.  The emeralds are very small and therefore not
individually extremely valuable, but the entire collection is certainly worth
a great deal of money.  More small gems litter the cavern as it continues to
the east and a relatively plain route winds through the stalagmites to the
south.

   Tiny emeralds, rubys and sapphires stud the floor of the cavern as well as
the stalagmites and stalagtites the path winds through.  The gems look easy
enough to pry away but almost all attempts end in failure.  It is as if the
gems have been magically bound to the stone.  At times, the gems form patterns
that almost seem to be words, or at least some sort of message.  If it is a
message, then it is unintelligible.  Crystals can be seen growing to the east
and more gems stud the pathway as it continues to the west.

Looking extremely fragile, the rows of crystals are tended quite carefully.
Moisture drips down from the ceiling above helping to feed the crystals.  The

decaying moss that is grown in the clearing that extends to the north and east.
Even rows indicate that this area is carefully tended, perhaps by whomever
tends the crystals that grow elsewhere in the cavern.  Moss grows in the wide
clearing that extends to the north and east and a narrow path leads up the
large stalagmite to the west.

All the patterns of the growing moss, and the rows of small fungi are easy to
make out.  Massive stalagmites hang down to the north, south, and west, making
it difficult to make much else out in the cavern.  One thing that can be seen
is a massive crystal spire of some sort far to the northwest.  The spire gleams
even in the darkness.  It looks almost like a giant stalagmite that has been
smoothed and polished to the point that it gives off a faint glow.
Unfortunately, the faint light it emits gives no clear idea of how far it might
actually be.

been torn and scratched by some sort of massive battle.  The battle ended long
ago but the damage remains.  Sharp shards of stone lie scattered about, ready
to pierce the boots of the unwary.  The faint shimmer of tiny crystals that
have begun growing in the scars the battle has left behind gives the cavern a
somewhat strange life-like quality.

It is clear that there is a variety of life in the cavern, the quiet indicates
how dangerous it is to make any sort of sound here.  The path twists from
south to east as it winds toward a faint glow to the northeast.

tremble to the entire cavern.  The twisting path continues to the north and

Each crystal emits a certain resonant tone when it is tapped, some of them
even sound as if they are hollow.  If the neat rows were exposed to a soft

is calm and the crystals are quiet.  The clearing continues to the north and

&+LA &+rCr&+Rys&+Wtal Grove&N~
   The large red crystals that grow here appear to have been left untended.  A
number of the crystals have grown large and twisted, seemingly against the
designs of the other groves of crystals that can be found throughout the large
cavern.  The growers of the crystals may have a mysterious purpose though,
perhaps they have been allowed to grow this way be design.  A number of
larger crystals have grown together in a large mound to the west and a large
stalagmite is to the north, but the rest of the clearing continues to the south
and east.

   Red crystals have grown together to create a jagged altar that stands here
atop a mound also made of red crystals.  Despite its red coloration, the eerie
altar doesn't seem to be used for any sort of blood-sacrifice.  It appears to
simply be a place to pray.  There are no symbols representing any gods here
suggesting that almost any faith might find a use for it.

Extremely wide, flat blue crystals grow here, spaced out and tended
carefully by whatever farms them.  The crystals are extremely thick and sturdy
and could be made into interesting shields or armor.  The crystal would be
somewhat fragile though and might shatter in combat.  More crystals can
be seen growing to the west and the entrance to the clearing lies to the south.

   A large stalagmite to the west has been carefully modified to create a
door that is hidden to those on its far side.  The small path it conceals
wanders to the north where it ends before a large crystal spire.  Worn stone

&+WBefore the Crystal Gates&N~
   Beautiful crystal gates guard the entrance to a magnificent crystal spire
to the east.  The spire looks like a highly polished stalagmite that reaches
all the way to the ceiling.  Smooth surfaces end at a variety of jagged edges
that jut out from the spire to tear at the air surrounding it.  The gates that
guard the entrance to the spire are made from an intricate lattice of crystal
that looks almost as if it was woven or spun together somehow.  The crystal
looks fragile at first, but close inspection reveals a faint magical aura and a
distinct impression of permanence.  The magic of the crystals hints that a
hammer would shatter before they would.

   A vague light seeps out of the surrounding crystal, giving color to the

veins in the crystal itself.  A faint hum from the crystal pillars and walls
here gives the distinct impression that the crystal spire itself is alive and
perhaps even sentient.  Intricate crystal gates exit the spire to the west and
crystal pillared hallways extend to the north, south and east.

translucent, but not enough that one can see what is on the other side.
The rest of the area is relatively plain, there are no chairs or tables of any
sort here, just the pillars that reach up to the high ceiling and the crystal
door to the north.

delicate-looking crystal, from the walls to the north to the long pillars that
reach up to the high ceiling.  There are no other furnishings though, the
crystal alone is decoration enough.  A faint glow comes from all the crystal
giving a faint, but welcome, light to the entire area.  Hallways extend to the

appears to drive straight upward through the center of the ceiling to the top
of the spire.  It is impossible to say how high it goes though, the faint glow
of the surrounding crystal makes estimates of the depth of the opening
difficult at best.  Hallways shrouded by intricate crystal pillars lead off to

   Deep blue crystal mixes with pale blue crystal to form an intricate throne
that stands in the center of the room.  The throne doesn't really look like
something that has been constructed, rather, it almost appears to have been
grown somehow.  Intricate, but abstract, designs line the walls, highlighted by
precious gemstones and colored crystals.  There are no additional seats here
for advisors, or even visitors, the only seat is the throne itself.  The throne
sits on a raised dais of transparent crystal that makes it seem to float in
mid-air.  A crystal hallway leads away from the throne room to the west.

mold crystal in such smooth fashion.  A plain, narrow hallway leads west

really nothing of note in the vault itself.  A few tiny gems can be spotted

Unfortunately, it would appear that the owners of the vault find thin crystals
to be highly valuable, whereas most of the rest of the world finds them to be
relatively worthless.  There are a few odd crystals lieing around that have an

in the first place.  Powerful magic of some strange sort seems to have been at

things.  The wall to the south that guards this room appears to swivel outward

that which is already here.  The hallway goes no further, though another week
or two of melting will almost certainly create another room.  There is no hint

presence, but there is clearly a powerful magic at work here.

wide caverns above.  There are not many observant enough to notice the small
gap in the stones that led down here.  The tunnel continues to wind downward
toward the sound of dripping water and heads through a gap in some stones
above to enter a huge cavern.

air itself.  The continual dripping is disconcerting and disorienting.  The
pool appears to extend off to the north and west.

&+bA Pool of Dark, Brackish Water&N~
   Their is an oily darkness to the water that leaves one wondering what
else might be in it.  There are no fish or other creatures living in the pool
of water, unless they are particularily well-hidden.  Moisture drips into
the pool from the walls and ceiling, even seeming to drip right out of the
air itself.  The continual dripping is disconcerting and disorienting.  The
pool appears to extend off to the north and east and more solid footing is
to the west.

&+LA Dark, &+bWet&+L Cavern&N~
   Hot, humid air swirls through the cavern like an invisible hand.  The
discomfort is matched by the eerie sounds that echo through the cavern.
Dripping water both magnifies and obscures the sounds as they bounce off
the rocky walls.  A pool of dark, vile-looking water lies immediately to
the east and the cavern continues to the north.

&+WA Shimmering Crystal Cavern&N~
   This well-hidden cavern is as moist and humid as the caverns that lead
to it, yet is very different indeed.  Massive crystals line the walls,
emitting a soft glow that causes the moist droplets of water to glimmer
and shine like minature diamonds.  Though the crystals range from
pale green to violet, most are a transparent or white.  A narrow opening
slants through the walls to the south to meet another cavern and the
crystal caverns themselves extend to the north and east.

&+WA Shimmering Crystal Cavern&N~
   It is clear that few creatures have found their way here, and those
that have seem to be content to feed on the odd crystals that grow here.
Droplets of water hang from the glowing crystals, looking almost like
liquid diamonds as the drip down to pools of water on the cavern floor.
Even some of the pools of water shimmer and glow in the light.  The
cavern continues to the south and east.

&+WNear a &+RRed Hot&N &+WCrystal&N~
   A large crystal juts out of a wide pool of water, glowing with a ferocious
heat.  Steam rises from all sides of the crystal and the pool that surrounds
it bubbles and boils.  There is no visible reason the crystal should be so hot,
yet its very warmth appears to be what has made this cavern so humid and
uncomfortable.  The crystal cavern continues to the south, east, and west.

&+WA Shimmering Crystal Cavern&N~
   Puffs of steam swirl through the otherwise stagnant air.  The moving
air is both hotter and wetter than the already uncomfortable cavern air
and provides no relief.  The cavern has a strange beauty to it, glowing
crystals provide a dim light that seems to focus on the beads and films
of water that form along the walls causing them to shimmer and glow.
Diamond-like droplets of water fall into glowing pools of water sending
pearl-shaded ripples toward their crystal enclosures.

&+WA Shimmering Crystal Cavern&N~
   The hot, humid air is so full of water that the glowing crystals that
line the walls seem to spear the water right out of the air.  Water drips
down from the ceiling and walls of the cavern to collect in small pools on
the cavern floor.  The strange light from the crystals is quite faint, yet
seems to focus on the water in the cavern, giving every drop of water,
as well as the small pools, a shimmering quality.

   This spot seems to collect every sound of the cavern and magnify it.
Dripping water has had its annoying sound magnified to the point that it
is deafening, and almost able to drive one insane.  Few creatures of any
sort even travel into this part of the cavern, making it safe for anyone
willing to withstand the aural attack of the cavern itself.
