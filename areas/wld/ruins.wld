&+yA Dusty Trail&N~
   &+cThis seems to be a short trail that has been long abandoned.  Small
&+cclouds of &+ydust&N &+crise in the air with each step you take, obscuring
&+cany trace of previous passersby.  The sky is a dull cloudy&N &+Lgrey&+c, with
&+cthe faintest traces of &+Wmist&n &+cfloating on the horizon.  Ahead, you
&+csee a small clearing surrounded by dead and dying trees.

&+yhalf-collapsed on itself.  The way out of this foreboding area
&+yis to the south.

   &+bThis Mansion was once the seat of luxury, well, as luxurious as
&+ba village home can be.  The previous tenants obviously cared for the
&+bhome, as the delicate filigreed wallboards and finely sculpted ceiling
&+btiles show.  The walls are painted an eggshell&N &+Cblue&+b, what is left of
&+bthe ceiling a sheer&N &+Wwhite&+b, and the floors a deep earthy brown&+b.
&+bUnfortunately though, the disaster hit here very harshly, for the walls
&+bare all cracked and broken, the ceiling mostly caved in, and the floors are
&+bchipped and buckled as though a great weight had stomped heavily on them.
&+bThe exits are north and down.

&+gsecond only to the Elder's house and one other.  The walls are still
&+gstanding, the roof is whole.  Looking around, you can tell that there
&+gis someone living here, for the clutter is amazing; clothes scattered
&+garound, dishes on the table, reading parchments in a pile by a rather
&+gcomfortable looking chair.  A collection of birdfeathers points to
&+gthe shopkeeper &+wAnguinel&+g as being the culprit.  Then again, who could
&+gblame him?  It's one nice house!

&+LAn Unexpectedly Large Room&N~
   &+LThis room is rather large, and what a sight it is!  There are great
&+rbeasts&+L roaring and snarling, over there, a duo is wrestling in a rather
&+Lvicious manner, over here what looks to be a female is tending to little &+ycubs&N
&+Lwhile at the exact center of the room you can see a raised seat, over which a
&+Lgoodly sized &+bBeholder&N &+Lhovers, watching the lesser beings before it with a
&+Ldetached gaze.  You can see &+ccages&N &+Lscattered all over the room, with starved
&+Land bruised Humans cowering inside.  As you enter, all activity stops, the
&+Lmonsters stare at you in surprise, then as one, they raise their weapons and
&+Lcharge..
&+LYour exits are west and east.

&+LA Narrow Tunnel&N~
   &+LThis tunnel is much more narrow than the main tunnels, though
&+Lthe ceiling is still quite tall.  You can hear snarls and growls
&+Lquite loudly here, as if great beasts were approaching.  But,
&+Lin these tunnels, who can tell where they are from.. ?
&+LYour exits are east and west.

&+LThe Tunnel &+rTurns&N &+LHere&N~
   &+LHere, the tunnel curves decidedly North and East.  One could
&+Lalmost think that a great worm or the like, bored these tunnels
&+Lbased on the smoothness of the walls.  You raise your lamp to check,
&+Land see the marks of tools. What fine work this is!

   &+LThe tunnel &+rturns&N &+Lhere, allowing you to either go
&+Lnorth, going closer towards the growling and fighting noises,
&+Lor west, which takes you back to the darkly quiet tunnels.

&+ylong stems of&N &+gbrambles&N &+yand&N &+gweeds&+y. To the north is the&N &+Lburned&N &+yout shell of
&+ya house, and to the south you can see the remnants of a shattered home.

&+yA&N &+LBurned&N &+yOut Husk of a House&N~
   &+yThis house was once home to a well-to-do &+gfarmer&+y. Now, however,
&+yit is a&N &+Lburned&+y-out husk of its former glory, merely home to rats
&+yand mice that scurry through the rubble in search of whatever it
&+yis rodents seek.
&+yThe only exit is to the south.

&+mA Once-Luxurious Home&n~
   &+mThis home has been nearly levelled by the destruction that overtook
&+mthe village.  From the fragments of wallcoverings and furnishings
&+mthough, you can see how well this house had been cared for.  Delicate
&+mpaintings of flowers and birds grace the plaster, the furniture was
&+mcarved in elaborate patterns.  The rubble could hide any number of
&+mthings though, so it would be wise to step with great caution.
&+mYour only exit is to the north.

&+yThe Path Continues..~
   &+yThe path wanders through the town, going east and west.  Ahead to
&+ythe east you can see where the path curves southwards.  The houses
&+yare in worse condition north and south than the ones previous, making
&+yyou think this was perhaps the lower class part of town.

&+gAn Abandoned Home&N~
   &+gThe house here looks like it was abandoned in a rush as the tenants
&+gtried to get to safety.  The furniture is overturned, there are
&+gpersonal items strewn over the floor.  There's even packages left
&+gunopened on the table.  The only exit is south.

   &+GThis house obviously had belonged to a farmer as evidenced by
&+Gthe tools in one corner, the&N &+ymuddy&N &+Lrotten&N &+Gboots by the door.
&+GThe walls are in very sad shape, and the roof is mostly caved in
&+Gwith shingles scattered over the floor.  The exit is to the north.

   &+yThe path turns sharply here.  To the west goes back into the town,
&+yand to the south you can see overgrown&N &+gfields&N &+yof&N &+Ycorn&N &+yand&N &+Ywheat&+y.  As
&+yyou walk south, the small animal sounds that were missing in town
&+ybecome louder.

&+ythe north.  Small creatures scurry in the grasses and you can hear the
&+yfaint sounds of larger beings moving around to the south.  You head
&+ycloser to investigate...

&+yApproaching a Farm's Gate..&N~
   &+yThe trail here leads straight towards a farm gate that lies half-
&+yopened. The dimness makes it difficult to see further, but there seem
&+yto be overgrown dying fields to the south.  The sounds of the remaining
&+yinhabitants of this poor village grow dim, a silence engulfing the area
&+yas you go nearer to the apparently abandoned farm.

&+gNow, though, the crops are quite overgrown, and no longer feed
&+gthe village inhabitants.  Small&N &+Lblackened&N &+Bblueberry&N &+gbushes
&+gcover the ground, while the once-leafy and withered tops of &+ypotato&N
&+gplants &+gerupt in uneven scattered rows.

&+gNow, though, the crops are quite overgrown, and feed nothing living but
&+gfor insects and worms that live here.  The decayed remains of bright &+Ggreen
&+Gbean&N &+gplants lay wherever their seeds seem to have fallen, with miserly
&+Rtomato&N &+gplants growing &+gin unevenly spaced rows.  An old farmhouse is
&+gvisible to the north, an old, surprisingly well-kept barnyard and &+rbarn&n
&+gto the east.

   &+mThis old farmhouse has seen much better care than it receives now.
&+mThe shutters are all skewed, windows broken and boarded over, the front
&+msteps are warped and squeak under your feet.  You enter the room to see
&+mthat indeed, someone lives here, in fact, it looks like this farmhouse
&+mwas left totally untouched by the devastation elsewhere.  The old farmer
&+mlooks up from his meal, astounded at the abrupt entry of strangers into
&+mhis home.  His &+wgrey&+m-haired wife drops her cooking pot on the
&+mfloor in surprise.  Your only exit is south.

   &+rThis big old barn stands tall even after many many years of hard use.
&+rThe planks of the walls and floor are still strong and holding fast, the
&+rroof is sturdy and complete.  On the left side you can see the stalls
&+rwhere the animals are kept at night, while on the right side is stored
&+rall the equipment the farmer uses to maintain the small field behind the
&+rhouse for his personal food.  The larger machines are in disuse now,
&+rthough, since it's become too dangerous to be out alone in the fields so
&+rfar from the house.  Too many have died trying....
&+rThe only exit is to the west into the barnyard.
