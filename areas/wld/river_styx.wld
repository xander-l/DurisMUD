&+LA Lonesome Dock By the River Styx&N~
&+L   This flat section of desolate terrain is dominated by a huge wooden&N
&+Ldock which juts north into the inky black waters of a raging river. As&N
&+Lfar as can be seen to the north, the foaming waters of the River Styx&N
&+Lflow deep into rocky depths of this abysmal land. Near the land side&N
&+Ledge of the river's dock stands a massive pole of a strange, incredibly&N
&+Lhard wood, enshrouding in wisps of a silken web-like material. A finely&N
&+Lcrafted bone horn hangs from the pole by a &+Wglowing strand of silver&N
&+Lchain. Outward from the dock expand the rocky lands of Avernus, the first&N
&+Lplane of the Nine Hells by the descriptions of folk lore and sage.&N

dock wooden~
&+yThis massive wooden dock is made of multiple planks of some strange&N
&+ygreyish wood. The whole structure floats upon the black waters of the&N
&+yriver, rising up and down with the surging waters. Strange bushes and&N
&+yreeds push up through the planks, threatening to one day destroy the&N
&+ystructure despite that fact it appears to have survived for quite some&N
&+ytime already.

pole wood~
&+y   This massive wooden pole stands some fifteen feet high, its entire&N
&+ylength covered in splinters and intricate carvings which are totally&N
&+yalien and incomprehensible. From the many splinters hang &+Wfine strips of&N
&+Wa white wispy material&+y, looking much like woven spider webs which blow&N
&+ygently in the breeze. Despite the splinters and seeming ill condition,&N
&+ythe wooden pole is stronger than steel and resists all attempts to harm&N
&+yits surface..why even the splinters will not bend! Finally, a large&N
&+yhorn carved from bone hangs by a chain from the side of the pole about&N
&+ysix feet from the ground.&N

&+m   Jet black waters which comprise the River Styx flow savagely from&N

&+msolid rock. The height of the underground tunnel is extremely hard to&N
&+mestimate in the pitch black darkness, but surely it is over one-hundred&N
&+mfeet high from the echoes of running water. A multitude of nooks and&N
&+mcrannies can be seen in the tunnel walls and shadowy movement sometimes&N

&+mUpon the River Styx&N~
&+m   Slowly, but purposefully, the waters of the legendary River Styx&N
&+mflow through this vast underground tunnel. All around the waters are&N
&+mthe rocky outcroppings of caves and ledges, which reach up until the&N
&+mdarkness of the area conceals them from sight. From the echoes of some&N
&+mnearby shrill screeches, it is clear the tunnel is inhabited even within&N
&+mthese unseen recesses. Occasionally, rocks fall from the riverside&N
&+mcliffs to crash into the waters, sending ripples through the water which&N
&+msuddenly begin to glow with a faint purple light.&N

&+mUpon the River Styx&N~
&+m   An apparent anomaly of the River Styx exists here for a gentle breeze&N
&+mcan be felt which seems to originate in the river branch north of here. As&N
&+mthe wind blows across the water, ripples briefly form in its black surface&N
&+mbefore the prevailing south to west flow of the main river disperses them.&N
&+mMore of the surrounding black rock comprises the river tunnel, filled with&N
&+mthe jagged niches all so common to the region, although some of the rock&N
&+mformations near the northern passage have been eroded slightly by the&N
&+mwind.&N

&+mA Windy Branch of the River Styx&N~
&+m   This portion of the river is a branch off of the main flow of the Styx,&N
&+mwhich can be seen to the south. Brisk breezes flow through the area,&N
&+moriginating from somewhere to the north, which cause large ripples to dent&N
&+mthe solid black surface of the water. Jutting rock protrusions about the&N
&+mtunnel sides cause the wind to whistle softly as it passes over them.&N
&+mSmall amounts of erosion can be noted on the surrounding rock, as bits of&N
&+mdust fall into the river stream.&N

&+mA Windy Branch of the River Styx&N~
&+m   Howling winds dominate this portion of the river as they whip over the&N
&+msurrounding rock faces and send showers of dust and rock fragments into&N
&+mthe black river water. Small waves have been generated on the Styx from&N
&+mthe wind, and it is exceedingly difficult to travel upstream to the east.&N
&+mEerie howls come from the tunnel ahead and one can't be sure if it is some&N
&+mtrick of the wind, or the cries of some beast using the wind for cover.&N

&+m   Blown about by fierce howling winds, this portion of the River Styx&N
&+mhas large waves and ripples within its surface which cause it to flow&N
&+mswiftly to the west. Dusty particles and rock chips often fly about the&N
&+marea, torn from the jagged rocks which surround the river. To the west,&N
&+mthe river reaches a landing which quickly branches off into several&N
&+mtunnels. Obviously, something deep within these tunnels must be the source&N

&+mHoneycombed with pits and cave entrances, these walls could be homes&N
&+mfor hundreds of foul creatures, easily remaining out of view of any&N

&+mwide enough here that the danger of the swirling waters can be avoided&N
&+mwith a little care. While the waters north of here seem to calm after the&N
&+mwhirlpool, a swift river current from the south feeds the whirlpool with&N

&+Lviolent water seems to suck in the blackness before spitting it out in a&N
&+Lsluggish flow to the north. Opposite the entrance to the cave, in the&N
&+Lsouthwest corner of the room, a small deep hole allows glimpses of a vast&N
&+Lswampland and ocean. Sickly vapors rise from the scenery and flow across&N
&+Lthe water of the swampland like plagues of foul insects.&N
