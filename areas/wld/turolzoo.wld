&+gA Shattered Gate&n~
&+g   Standing in the middle of the field of debris is a shattered metal gate
&+galongside a crumbling red brick wall that stretches to the north and south.
&+gThe gate had been shut and locked with a very large iron chain, but something
&+gbashed the gate open from the inside, shattering the chain into a thousand
&+grusted pieces that now lie at your feet. A small metal plaque is set into the
&+gwall on the right side of the gate.&n

&+gA Path Through The Debris&n~
&+g   A path of sorts exists through the debris field here running roughly in an
&+geast-west direction. A red brick wall and a smashed gate can be seen close by

&+g   Four paths intersect here amidst the ruins of a large water fountain. The
&+gfountain was once carved with creatures of all kinds, but time has eroded the
&+gfigures into unrecognizable lumps. Ruins of large buildings can be seen to
&+gthe north, west, and south. A broken sign lies here buried in some rubble.&n

&+GA Cage&N~
&+g   Blasted is the best way to describe this cage as it appears that the former
&+goccupant went berserk and bashed its way out. The wall has become damaged and
&+gseveral plants have found thier way inside. The main hallway lies to the south.&n

&+gAn Overgrown Field of Debris&n~
&+g   A large, overgrown field of debris stretches off to the south. It appears
&+gthat this was once a very large building, and due to the amount of broken
&+gglass that litters the ground, it may have been a large greenhouse. All that
&+gremains of the building are wall and column remnants no larger than a gnome.&n

&+mA Dark Building&n~
&+g   This building is very dark and only the tiniest amount of light is filtering
&+gthrough the many cracks in the building. Upon closer examination, it appears
&+gthat someone has been placing mud over the cracks from the inside. The main
&+gwalkway continues to the south and is lined by cages.&n

&+gthe cage itself has been busted open with such force that it lies embedded

&+g   This dark cage is missing every single bar that ever existed here. Tiny
&+gpieces of them can be seen scattered in the rubble, but it is simply an open
&+gfaced hole that leads back to the west. Tiny cracks line the walls, and the
&+gsouthern wall looks extremely stressed.&n
