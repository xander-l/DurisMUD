&+LRuined &+yGates &+Lof &+wVarathorn &+LKeep&N~
&+L   These are the ruined gates of the once mighty &+wVarathorn &+LKeep.  Many legends&N
&+Lwere told of a great kingdom centuries ago.  They tell how a young man who was&N
&+Lnamed &+wVarathorn &+Lrose to power in a brutal barbaric way.  Killing any who dared&N
&+Lto even consider standing in his way.  Rulers and lands were conquered, he had&N
&+Lalmost everything.  &+WBones &+Land faded stains of &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd &+Lrest eternal upon the dead&N
&+Llifeless ground.  Images of battles flicker and fade in and out of the abysmal&N
&+Lstagnant air.  Sounds from battles long since past seem to cascade off &+Wp&+wh&+wa&+Wn&+wt&+Wo&+wm&N
&+Lwalls that don't exist.&N

&+L   The bits of &+Wbones &+Lof those who dared to dwell here before you rest upon the&N

&+L   These &+rstains &+Lseem like they are centuries old.  As you gaze at them you fade&N
&+Lback into the long ago past.  When this keep was not in ruins, yet was a grand&N
&+Land mightly place.  Images of great battles flash before the eyes, warriors of&N
&+Llight being slain by a young man.  Heads of the enemies placed upon wicked ten&N
&+Lfoot spikes.  Feeble weak being lit ablaze, children forced to watch as their&N
&+Lmothers are beheaded.  Laughter of the one insane with power, cackles into the&N
&+Lmind and shivers the spine.  The nocturnal name N&+bro&+Lh&+bt&+Lereb echoes into your evil&N
&+Lthoughts.  Powers beyond understanding are at work, feelings of despair, turn&N
&+Lback before it is too late.  Reality invades the world again, present becomes&N
&+Lthe now.  Memories from the past flicker, yet shall never fade.&N

&+LDreary Dismal &+wOubilette&N~
&+L   Darkness cloaks this dreary weary wicked abysmal room.  A place to forget&N
&+Labout all the stress and woes of the demonic world.  Stains of &+rcrimson &+Ladorn&N
&+Lthe cold jagged stone walls.  Remnants from those who have been tossed here to&N
&+Lwaste away into oblivion.  Stench of death and dismal decay dominates within&N
&+Lthis horrid hole.  Many &+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+Cs &+Lhave been lost in this putrid listless place.&N

&+L   Walls of hard stone create this sadistic &+Ct&+cw&+Ci&+cl&+Ci&+cg&+Ch&+ct &+Ltower.  The light flickers&N
&+Land fades into demented twisted view.  Unlike the rest of the keep, for some&N
&+Lreason the tower is almost in perfect condition.  Some strong magical force&N
&+Lmust be keeping the structure intact for the most part.  Strange glowing runes&N
&+Lhave been etched into the stairs here.  Perhaps this is some sort of warlock&N
&+Lincantation to keep things in a state of suspended animation.  Whatever the&N
&+Lmeaning of the symbols, most likely it is nothing that is known to those not&N
&+Lfamiliar with the black arts.  The staircase continues on leading up and down.&N

&+L   This is the top of the twisted tower of shairak.  Unlike the rest of the&N
&+Lplace, this area does not have any mystical ruines that adorn it.  The stones&N
&+Lhere show heavy damage and decay, nothing is here to prevent time from taking&N
&+Lits demonic toll.  Stains of crimson and chips from swords and mighty battle&N
&+Lhammers mark the once perfect construct.  Vegetation and other forms of pseudo&N
&+Llife exist here.  The sky above is a raven darkness that no eyes can truly ever&N
&+Lhope to penetrade.  Below leads back into the &+Ct&+cw&+Ci&+cl&+Ci&+cg&+Ch&+ct &+Leerie frigid fright.&N
