This case contains the war hammer of Khildarak Strongstone. It is said that
the enchantress that made this hammer for Khildarak retrieved it upon his
death and locked it in this magical case. Khildarak wielded this war hammer
for 100 years before his death, using it to send many creatures to meet
their maker. It is rumored that the hammers magical nature made Khildarak
invinceable while wielding it. His death added weight to this rumor as he
was killed in a freak mine cave-in while on a routine expedition. He did not
have the hammer with him at his time of death. Khildaraks party was never
found as the cave-in was immense, only a few members in the rear of the
party escaped to tell. It is rumored that the enchantress fashioned the
lock of this case to only accept one of Khildaraks bones as its key.

&+WThe Bone Yard&N~
   This area has been constructed by Clan Dry Skull to serve as a nursery and
initial training ground for the strongholds children. A large wall constructed
of &+Wdried &+Wvermin bones&N encloses the entire area, allowing vermin to be released
into the yard for the children to hunt. The floor is covered with a thick layer
of &+Wvermin bones&N and &+rcorpses&N, serving as toys for the children to dig in and
play with. Insects swarm over the decomposing &+rcorpses&N, rising up in large
clouds. The smell of decay is strong. The &+Wbone yard&N continues to the north

&+yTraining Grounds&N~
   The cavern floor has been smoothed and leveled in this and surrounding
areas to be used as training grounds. The floor is covered with animal &+ydung&N,
both dried and fresh, creating a strong odor that seems to rise up from the
floor and create an invisible fog of stench. Noises of both animals and
masters echo occasionally in the vastness of the cavern, making it hard to
determine exactly which direction the noises come from. A natural wall rising
up from the floor of the cavern borders the area to the north. A wall built
from large &+Wstones&N runs between the clan house and the natural wall to the
west, a gate visible in the center. The grounds continue to the east and

&+mGrumblers Way&N~
   This street is very narrow, formed by the backs of buildings lining the
west side of the street and fronts of buildings lining the east side of the
street, the closeness of the buildings giving it an almost alley-like feel.
The street is covered by a thick layer of &+Wstone&N and rock chips. Sounds of
the clan and market sections of town echo lightly from the east. The entrance
to a Duergar home can be seen to the east. The street continues to the north
and south.

of buildings closely bordering the east and west sides of the street. The
street is paved with a thick layer of loose rock and &+Wstone&N chips, providing
a comfortable surface for walking that is suitable for merchants wagons.
Sounds of the clan and market areas of the stronghold can be heard echoing
over the Duergar homes from the east. An occasional whiff of gourmet fungus
drifts past, as well as less tasteful smells from far to the south. The
street continues to the north and south.

in this area, almost drowning out other sounds of the stronghold that echo in
from the south. Looking over the clanhouse to the north the northern cavern
wall can be seen rising up out of sight. Grumblers Way starts to the west,

&+bblue&N veined marble. Four large marble columns rise up from the floor, each
polished and trimmed with carved &+Wivory&N. Several of the floor tiles have been

eye are made from a dark &+rred&N &+Wstone&N. Though magic if frowned upon when
used in excess by the Duergar culture, the crafts of this clan are looked
upon less harshly because of their nature. The members of this clan are not
as well respected as those of other clans, but they do not find themselves on
the recieving end of vandalism as much as other magic clans. A carved &+Wivory&N
door can be seen in the west wall. Hallways start both to the north and south.

   This room, set off of the main hallway within Clan Gold Stock,
is quite dark and simple.  Several pieces of furniture are in the room
including a desk, several small chairs, and numerous chests most likely
containing recent revenue collected by the members of the Clan.  Unlike
many of the other Clans of &+rKhildarak&N, Clan Gold Stock does not
serve as a residence or prayer location for its members, but simply as
an establishment for the grand Khildarak &+Wauction&N.
