&+mA Large Opening In The Cavern Wall&n~
     It appears that someone has constructed a large pair of adamantite
gates in the wall here.  The gates are solid and very sturdy, probably
forged in Khildarak.  There are small duergar engravings upon the large
adamantite gates.  There is also a large sign that has been pounded into
the ground just before the gates.  The gates don't seem to be locked, but
remain closed at all times.  Whatever is behind them, appears that they
like to stay behind them in safety.

&+yA Large Tunnel Leading To The Settlement&n~
     This large tunnel leads from the cavern to the south into the
large cave where the settlement is.  This tunnel has obviously been
dug by the duergar dwarves because of the unmistakable digging marks
made by their small tools.  There is also a signet mark of the clan
every few feet along the wall, making it very clear to any visitors
that this cave and the tunnel belong to the clan.

&+cThe Center Crossing&n~
      This center crossing seems to be a large intersection of the
tunnels and roads.  It appears that the royal road to the king's
castle leads to the north, while other tunnels lead off to the east
and to the west, probably towards the commoners homes and warriors
guilds of the settlement.  In addition to the tunnels and roads,
there is a large spider web-like set of stairs leading down a tunnel
just at the edge of the intersection.  There is a small warning sign
at the top of the stairs, but the writing has been worn off.

&+LDown A Long, Dangerous Climb&n~
     This small tunnel, with hand-carved stairs leads down into another
section of the underdark below the duergar settlement.  This section
seems to be barren of the duergar dwarves, and seems that hardly anyone
ventures down here anylonger.  However, there are apparently corpses
scattered about, as some of the duergar have fallen to their deaths. It
appears that at one time, this tunnel used to be widely used, until
recently, whatever is down there msut have frightened the duergar out
of the this dark tunnel.  A large cavern open up below here.

     This web filled cavern seems like it was originally part of the
duergar settlement, but obviously the settlement couldn't exist down
here, and for a good reason.  Apparently while this cavern was being
dug out, the duergar miners burrowed into a small drider breeding pit,
protected by the drow goddesses.  Immiediatly, a few of the miners
were slain, but most managed to flee back to the settlement, ever
since, these drider caverns have been left alone, and the drider have
left the duergar alone.

settlement chose to settle in such a place.  From platinum, to gold,
to mithril, to adamantium, the mines provide the settlement with
all the precious metals they need to conduct buisness with the other
rich races of the underdark, such as the drow who are in need of
heavily mined ores.  The mines contain a magical glow.

&+LIn The Duergar Mines&n~
    The duergar mines of this great duergar settlement are vast and
filled with the richest minerals in the underdark, probably why the
settlement chose to settle in such a place.  From platinum, to gold,
to mithril, to adamantium, the mines provide the settlement with
all the precious metals they need to conduct buisness with the other
rich races of the underdark, such as the drow who are in need of
heavily mined ores.  The mines contain a magical glow.

&+rThe Duergar Foreman's Office&n~
    The duergar foreman of the settlement has set up his office in
an upper shaft of the mines.  The office is very plain, with the only
luxuries of a desk, a small old oaken bookshelf, and a metal chair.
Other then that, the room is nothing more than a hollowed out piece
of the mine with durithalite walls. Small gems sparkle that have
been smoothed away by the miners when the room was dug out.

A Small Duergar Home~
    This small duergar home was dug out to size a family of at least
five maybe six family members.  The house is rather large, although
only one 'main' room just sectioned into different areas, there is
of course a kitchen, a wash basen, and beds around the different
walls.  The standard duergar fire place is at the back wall where
most of the cooking is done, and trophies are hung above.

the purpose of a shelter, it contains several valuable items of the
family, including many war trophies.

dealing without being watched by the other members of the community, more
of the lower skilled, or more shadier skilled rogues and assassins come
to do their dealings and buisness, some even living back in the alley.

    This secret tunnel was made probably when the settlement was first
being built.  This tunnel leads all around the city to different points,
where duergar can travel relatively safely during the ever unlikely
chance of a raid against their town.  The tunnel is very rough, probably
made without the care that the other tunnels were made with.  The
cavern in this tunnel is scattered with durithalite veins, making
magical teleportation virtually impossible.

&+LA Secret Tunnel&n~
    This secret tunnel was made probably when the settlement was first
being built.  This tunnel leads all around the city to different points,
where duergar can travel relatively safely during the ever unlikely
chance of a raid against their town.  The tunnel is very rough, probably
made without the care that the other tunnels were made with.  The
cavern in this tunnel is scattered with durithalite veins, making
magical teleportation virtually impossible.

proved to been a cave in at a weak point in the cavern, a fe skeletal
remains are just visible under the rocks that form this massive rubble
pile.  As well as the common underworld memorial items that are left
in memory of the dead, a small warning sign is posted at the rubble
warning of falling rocks.

section of tunnel that leads out of the main cavern the settlement is
in, and leads into a smaller one, not nearly the size, where the
training camp has been setup.  Many warriors, both young and old,
come here daily to train to help defend the settlement from invaders.

    This small duergar home was dug out to size a family of at least
five maybe six family members.  The house is rather large, although
only one 'main' room just sectioned into different areas, there is
of course a kitchen, a wash basen, and beds around the different
walls.  The standard duergar fire place is at the back wall where
most of the cooking is done, and trophies are hung above.

&+rThe Foyer of the Training Camp&n~
     The foyer of the training camp is quite simple, a small map
indicates the profession with which a young duergar needs to take
to become part of the royal guard.  To the north lies the assassin
or rogue training camp, while to the south lies the mercenary training
camp.  Totheeast lies the warrior training camp, and finally a set
of stairs leads to the cleric training camp and temple.  The stairs
are made of ivory, and this room is rather nondescript except for
the stairs, being rather barren with only a few waiting chairs and
the occaisional duergar passing through.

&+LThe Rogue Training Camp&n~
    The rogue training camp is a series of rooms of dummies prepared
for backstabbing and dirttossing and tripping.  In addition to the
normal abuse any dummy gets, these dummies have particularily stuffed
boddies to prevent too much damage from the double backstabs.  The
duergars in charge of the rogue training camp teach the students daily
and the head instructor has an office up the stairs.

&+yThe Mercenary Training Camp&n~
     The mercenary training hall is much more complex than any of the
other training halls, with the possible exception of the temple. The
mercenary training hall has many skills to teach the duergar, including
headbutting, backstabbing, tracking, hiding, throat crushing, bashing
and much many more.  Included in the room are many practice dummies,
bent swords that have been broken on attempted backstabs, and even
a few duergar who have knocked themselves out on the dummies. The head
instructor's office is located up the stairs.

&+BThe Warrior Training Camp&n~
    The duergar warrior training hall is one of the largest training
hall in all of the training center.  No matter what skills the young
duergar posses, most of them can come here to train to be a warrior,
escpecially if they don't have the agility or dexterity to become
a rogue or mercenary, or the wisdom to become a cleric.  The warrior
training hall is simply a bunch of sparring stalls with instructors
there to watch their students practice.  The head instructors office
is upward past the stairs.

    The duergar temple is the begining of the long journey for the
duergar cleric, who often endures many hardships compared to the more
intelligent races of Duris.  In all of the travels of the great
duergar travellers, they have encountered hardly any others who have
had the great difficulties of the duergar cleric.  This temple was
designed for the clerics to train.  The main altar where the head
cleric teaches lies to the north, while many clerics come to this
beginning practice area to pray in peace.

     This office belons to the head rogue of the training center.  He
has his own office to store poisons and extra piercing weapons, as well
as the standard suit of rogue armor.  The office is fairly plain, with
most of the walls and even the items colored in black.  There is a small
desk and chair in one of the corners where the head rogue rests, there
is also a sparring mat in the other corner, and finally, a small bunk
on the remaining wall.

    This office of the duergar instructor is one of great prizes and
trophies.  For starters, the rope-tied corpses of all sorts of races
are hung up about the walls, even some that have just been hung up,
still alive and kicking in their ropes.  Daggers, scalps, and other
body parts are also hung up around the walls as trophies, as well
as suits of armor that are too big for the great duergar mercenary.

being one of the king's former head commanders, this duergar has seen
it all, from the ugly mountain dwarves to the slippery grey elves,
and he has hanging corpses to prove it.  The office is furnished
with decorated armor, awards, and furniture.

The Altar~
    This altar is the main worship place of the duergar master cleric.
This entire temple seems to be circular, and on the second level of the
training building.  The altar lies in the dead center of the building
and consists of a sacraficing table surrounded by a two foot deep pool.
There are constantly duergar clerics here praying to their gods for
their spells, and the master cleric offering up sacrafice.

only one 'main' room just sectioned into different areas, there is
of course a kitchen, a wash basen, and beds around the different
walls.  The standard duergar fire place is at the back wall where
most of the cooking is done, and trophies are hung above.

A Small Storage Closet~
    This secret storage room at the back of the house is accessible
through the fireplace when the fire is not lit.  It was obviously made
incase of an emergency attack, and is quite comfortably laid out to
support a few family members for several days.  In addition to serving
the purpose of a shelter, it contains several valuable items of the
family, including many war trophies.

&+rThe Royal Road&n~
    The royal road is the path in the settlement that leads to the
great castle of the king.  The road is well maintained, and is walked
upon daily by many of the king's guardians and royal guards.  Many
of the guards have slain visitors to the town that have walked this
great road without the king's permissions, afterwards, several slaves
have been employed to clean up the bloody remains.

&+rThe Foyer of the Great Duergar Castle&n~
    The grand foyer of the duergar castle is one of great trophies
and drunken warriors.  The foyer of the castle acts like a social
gathering for the guests to the castle and for the returning duergar
warriors praising their glorious slaughters, and singing the songs
of battle. There are a set of royal stairs leading towards the
throne room, and the guest and emissary quarters lie to a hallway to
the west.  To the east, lies a small pantry where the maid sleeps.

The Maid's Quarters~
    An orc maid has been employed the king to keep the castle clean
escpecially after the returning raiding parties return half-drunk and
full of bloodlust, also for when the guests end up soiling their
rooms, especially the ogres and trolls.  The maid's room is quite simple,
just a little nitch in the side of the castle containing little more
than cleaning supplies and the necessities for living.

to protect against intruders.  The chimera of course has three heads
and is very nasty.  However, it doesn't seem to be able to leave this
room, but just stay here and protect against intruders.  A duergar
animal handler is stationed here to protect the guests as they enter.

    The great throne room of King StoutDorf is a throne room like none
else in the underdark.  Huge pillars are carefully placed throughout
the room to hold the establishment up.  The throne is at the very end
of a blood-red carpet that runs the length of the room.  Two high honor
bodyguards stand next to the throne while the old king sits in his chair
pondering his next deal.  He carries with him a huge battleaxe and wears
a crown of immense power.  To the east lies the conference room where
the current guest is welcome to present his ideas.  In the conference
area at this momment appears to be an arch-devil here to see the king
about forging an evil alliance.
