&+LA Collapsed Tunnel~
   This old, abandoned tunnel appears to have caved in at some distant time
in the past.  Great slabs of rock are jutting out from the floor, making it
difficult to move.  A thick layer of dust has combined with moisture to form
a kind of mortar between the boulders, blocking any attempt to move them.  A
recent tremor, however, has cracked part of the mortar.

&+LA Collapsed Tunnel~
   The tunnel opens up into a concave room.  Rotted tapestries hang from the
walls, depicting scenes of battle between humaniods and large upright wolves.
A circle of magic has been drawn into the center of the room, and hovering
slightly off the ground, a &+cs&+Ch&+Wi&+Yf&+Rt&+ri&+mn&+Mg&N &+Lrift&n in space-time can be seen.

   A circle of stones surrounds a &+cs&+Ch&+Wi&+Yf&+Rt&+ri&+mn&+Mg&+L rift&n in space-time, hovering here.
No living thing can be detected here, no rustle in the grass, not even the
wind can be felt.  A sense of timelessness pervades the area, giving all who
enter a feeling of uneasy peace.

&+LThe Entrance to &+mShadow&+Mfall&n~
&+L   A small farming village of Shadowfall lies directly to the north.
&+LPopulated by members of the &+wKimber&+L Tribe of &+ywolfen&+L, it is a quiet farming
&+Lcommunity, primarily &+Gagriculture&+L based.  Normal activity seems to be
&+Ldistrupted, however, as most of the population now resides inside the &+Ccity
&+cproper&+L, under the nervous eyes of the city guard.  The sparks and flashes of
&+Wlightning&+L can be seen emanating from beyond the northern city walls.&n

&+Lthemselves filled with some brownish material that seems to be highly

&+Lto sit in.&n

&+LThe &+GFo&+gr&+Ge&+gst&+L of &+wChaos&n~
&+L   The &+Gforest&+L seems alive with strange magic.  An unnatural darkness covers
&+Lthe entire &+ywoods&+L like a thick ebon blanket.  The constant &+Wspark&+L and &+Cflashing
&+Lof &+Blightning&+L offers some light, albeit laden with shadows that dance like
&+Lmacabre ghosts across the forest.  An odd blue lightning dances across the
&+Lsurface of everything in sight.  Crackling over the trees' &+yroots&+L, pulsing up
&+Lthier tall &+ytrunks&+L, and finally leaping like dancers from &+Gleaf&+L to wilted &+gleaf&+L.
&+LThe plantlife seems to be stricken with some form of rotting sickness that
&+Lthe mystical lightning appears strongest around.  Moans and screams can be
&+Lheard echoing through the forest, coming from no particular direction... and
&+Lfrom all.&n

&+LThe cold and wind are shut out, leaving all who enter with a warm feeling of
&+Lpeace.  The ground is cleared of all debris, and dominating the area is a
&+Llarge &+gwillow&+L tree, its branches like a shield to keep the evils of the world
&+Lat bay.  The leaves of this tree seem unnaturally healthy, and the bark is
&+La rich &+ybrown&+L; devoid of scars, diseases or any evidence of the damage caused
&+Lby the usual &+Wwinter&+L sleep.&n

&+LThe &+GFo&+gr&+Ge&+gst&+L of &+wChaos&n~
&+L   The &+Gforest&+L seems alive with strange magic.  An unnatural darkness covers
&+Lthe entire &+ywoods&+L like a thick ebon blanket.  The constant &+Wspark&+L and &+Cflashing
&+Lof &+Blightning&+L offers some light, albeit laden with shadows that dance like
&+Lmacabre ghosts across the forest.  An odd blue lightning dances across the
&+Lsurface of everything in sight.  Crackling over the trees' &+yroots&+L, pulsing up
&+Lthier tall &+ytrunks&+L, and finally leaping like dancers from &+Gleaf&+L to wilted &+gleaf&+L.
&+LThe plantlife seems to be stricken with some form of rotting sickness that
&+Lthe mystical lightning appears strongest around.  Moans and screams can be
&+Lheard echoing through the forest, coming from no particular direction... and
&+Lfrom all.&n

&+L   The &+Gforest&+L seems alive with strange magic.  An unnatural darkness covers
&+Lthe entire &+ywoods&+L like a thick ebon blanket.  The constant &+Wspark&+L and &+Cflashing
&+Lof &+Blightning&+L offers some light, albeit laden with shadows that dance like
&+Lmacabre ghosts across the forest.  An odd blue lightning dances across the

&+Lthier tall &+ytrunks&+L, and finally leaping like dancers from &+Gleaf&+L to wilted &+gleaf&+L.
&+LThe plantlife seems to be stricken with some form of rotting sickness that
&+Lthe mystical lightning appears strongest around.  Moans and screams can be
&+Lheard echoing through the forest, coming from no particular direction... and

&+L   The &+Gforest&+L seems alive with strange magic.  An unnatural darkness covers

&+Lof &+Blightning&+L offers some light, albeit laden with shadows that dance like
&+Lmacabre ghosts across the forest.  An odd blue lightning dances across the
&+Lsurface of everything in sight.  Crackling over the trees' &+yroots&+L, pulsing up
&+Lthier tall &+ytrunks&+L, and finally leaping like dancers from &+Gleaf&+L to wilted &+gleaf&+L.
&+LThe plantlife seems to be stricken with some form of rotting sickness that
&+Lthe mystical lightning appears strongest around.  Moans and screams can be
&+Lheard echoing through the forest, coming from no particular direction... and
&+Lfrom all.&n

&+L   The &+Gforest&+L seems alive with strange magic.  An unnatural darkness covers
&+Lthe entire &+ywoods&+L like a thick ebon blanket.  The constant &+Wspark&+L and &+Cflashing
&+Lof &+Blightning&+L offers some light, albeit laden with shadows that dance like
&+Lmacabre ghosts across the forest.  An odd blue lightning dances across the
&+Lsurface of everything in sight.  Crackling over the trees' &+yroots&+L, pulsing up
&+Lthier tall &+ytrunks&+L, and finally leaping like dancers from &+Gleaf&+L to wilted &+gleaf&+L.
&+LThe plantlife seems to be stricken with some form of rotting sickness that
&+Lthe mystical lightning appears strongest around.  Moans and screams can be
&+Lheard echoing through the forest, coming from no particular direction... and

&+LA Small &+WCottage&n~
&+L   This is a small &+Wcottage&+L.  Only the owner knows why he chose to live in this
&+Lhell.  It is sparsely furnished, although several bundles of exotic &+gherbs
&+Lhang from every concieveable place.  The mixture of these odors is not
&+Lunpleasant, as a large &+ytable&+L full of &+Wbowls&+L, &+ccauldrons&+L, and &+Cvials&+L exudes a
&+Lstench that could fell a horse.&n

&+LInside a &+CMerchant &+yWagon&n~
&+L   This simple &+wwagon&+L looks to have survived a few attacks in its lifetime of
&+Ltravels.  The &+ywood&+L of the frame is worn, the oak timbers held together with
&+Lwooden spikes and locking pins.  Overhead a tight oiled &+Wrothehide&+L canvas keeps
&+Lthe elements out of this cozy, if small, &+wwagon&+L.  Against the east wall, a
&+Lsmall &+Ystraw&+L matress marks the obvious sleeping area, while a small &+yfootbox
&+Lloaded with clothing marks the only furniture.&n

&+LThe &+cStorage&+L Area of the &+CMerchant &+yWagon&n~
&+L   This small room is loaded with empty &+ycrates&+L, piles of &+ylumber&+L, some scraps
&+Lof &+wtin&+L, and a handful of craftsman &+ctools&+L.  This is obviously where Aliester
&+Lmakes his instruments for his mobile business.  Despite its small size and the
&+Lnumber of items crammed into it, this room is surprisingly neat.  The main
&+Larea of the &+wwagon&+L lies through the archway to the south.&n
