&+gEntrance to the House of &+WAft&+werl&+Life~
&+g   This is the entryway to the mighty house of &+WAft&+werl&+Life&+g. In these
&+grooms they prepare for their adventurous travels, here they live a  happy
&+gand peaceful life between their travels. The floor of the hallway is  covered
&+gwith &+mdeep purple&+r carpet&+g, and there are several paintings hanging on the far
&+gwall. In the center of the room there is a &+Wmarble white fountain&+g  sitting,
&+gits &+Bwater &+bshimmering &+Cand &+Bflowing genly&+g to the draining hole. A set of stairs
&+gleads up from here towards the dinning room, and down from here towards the
&+galtar room and storage chambers. Eastwards there is a training room located.

&+gTop of the Flight of Stairs~
&+g   Here the wooden stairs come to an end, and form a small landing.
&+gEast from here, the landing opens to a huge dinning room, while to the
&+gwest of here a small hallway leads to a beautiful hanging garden.
&+gThe floor here is covered with various food stains. It seems like &+WAft&+werl&+Life
&+gmembers often try to sneak up and steal some of the food from  'official'
&+gdinners. The walls here are decorated with colorful paintings, depicting
&+gheroical deeds of &+WAft&+werl&+Life&+g members on their crusades.

&+gEntrance to the Basement~
&+g   A set of stairs come down to here, ending in a large cellar. There are
&+gthree doors set in the surrounding walls. South ones are the largest, with
&+ga huge white altar visible through it. East, there is a storage room visible,
&+gwhile a small shop is west from here. In the shadow behind the stairs, you
&+gcan see a large piece of &+Ghalf-rotten cheese&+g, and around it, there is a pool
&+gof &+ystinking &+Yurine &+yslowly drying.&+g The fact of its presence might be somehow
&+gexplained by an empty bottle of vodka sitting in the far corner.

&+WThe Food Storage Room~
&+g   This rectangular room serves as a food storage for &+WAft&+werl&+Life&+g members.
&+gThree walls are covered with shelves, where various kinds of food are being
&+gstored. In the center of the room, there is a stone basin, where easy-rotting
&+gfood is kept in the cool water to help prevent rotting. In the far northeast
&+gcorner of the room there is also a wine rack, half empty at the moment.

&+BBehind a Huge Crystal Window~
&+g   Here, in the huge upstairs room, is the dinning room of &+WAft&+werl&+Life.
&+gA set of twenty chairs stands around a huge oaken table, spaced evenly.
&+gOne chair is distinctly bigger than others, almost as if prepared to host
&+ga cow. The flat surface of the table bears many food stains, a visible  sign
&+gof being put into a good use.&+B The whole eastern wall is a huge crystalline
&+Bwindow, through which one can contemplate the view of nearby mountains.
&+BIn the corner of the room, &+gtheer is a small pool of &+Gspewn &+mvomits&+g, a clear
&+gsign of slight alcoholic overdosage during last celebration of some
&+gsuccesful resurrection.

&+gThe &+GHanging &+gGarden~
&+g   This part of the &+WAft&+werl&+Life&+g house has been changed into a
&+ghuge greenery. Many plants coming from exotic places grow here and
&+gthere, some of them as strange as the man-devouring marakanth plant
&+gfrom the marshes of Hyarann. The only strange thing about this greenery
&+gis that it is literaly suspended in the air, being a flat piece of
&+gwooden floor standing on wooden poles.

&+WThe Small Gift Shop~
&+g   This room, placed quite deep into the &+WAft&+werl&+Life &+ghouse, has been left barren.
&+gThe purpose for it is still here, this being the one-eyed hunchbacked gnome
&+gseller, who has made his way through &+WAft&+werl&+Life&+g guardians and decided to earn
&+gfor living by setting up a small shop here. At first, &+WAft&+werl&+Life&+g members wanted
&+gto throw him away, but later they realized this gnome can be of some use to
&+gthem. Mainly because of the little profit he makes on his shop.
&+gAnd little profit equals good prices.

&+WThe Room of Prayers~
&+W   This circular room has its walls covered with polished granite stones.
&+WIn the very center of the room, a white altar sits, devoted of all religious
&+Wsymbols, yet thanks to that its good for any religion. Around the altar,
&+Wthere are twenty kneeling pedestals placed, evenly spaced. The air in this
&+Wroom stands still, and there is a peaceful aura emanating from the altar.

&+yThe Room of Exercises~
&+y   This casualy designed room has a very simple purpose. It is the training
&+yroom for the believers in afterlife. Between their prayers and their crusades,
&+ythey come here to train their fighting and magical skills. To prevent too many
&+yinjuries, walls and floor of this room are covered with woolen blankets.
&+yAll around the room there is a different training equipement scattered: wooden
&+ydummies, turning swords, magic absorbing cube, and similar.
