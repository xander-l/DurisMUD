&+gBeginning of Aravne Forest~
     Here is where the &+Gjungle&n ends and the giant &+gforest&n begins.  Here
the trees at the edge of the &+gforest&n are simply very large.  Farther in,
however, they grow to inconceivable heights allowable only by their innate
magic.  The center of the &+gforest&n is where the &+Wwonderous&n city of &+gAravne&n
can be found among the largest of the giant &+gtrees&n.  It is rumored that in
the center of that great city stands the &+GWorld &+gtree&n, which is said to
touch the sky and the realm of the &+Wgods&n themselves.  The path leads onward
toward the city to the north, and back into the &+Gjungle&n to the south.

&+gPath Along the Forest Floor&n~
     Here the &+gforest&n path continues northward toward the &+gtree&n city of
&+gAravne&n.  The path is fairly well traveled, although it is not until much
farther to the north that the safety of the &+Wcity&n patrol boundary can be
reached.  For this reason, caravans laden with valuable goods from faraway
lands often push onward after leaving the &+Gjungle&n until they reach safety
to the north.  Rumors of &+Lbandits&n and &+gtheives&n have become minor legends
throughout the area, and are taken very seriously by those who travel here.

&+gPath Approaching a Small Clearing~
     The &+gforest&n path approaches a small clearing to the north.  Although
the forest floor here has seen nothing but shadows for countless &+Wmillenia&n,
rays of light penetrate nearly to the &+gforest&n floor up ahead.  It is not
apparent from here what may have caused the clearing up ahead, but after days
of travel through the &+Ldark&n &+Gjungle&n it looks like a tempting place to
rest.

&+gA Clearing in the Forest~
     Here the &+gforest&n path opens into a large &+yclearing&n.  Athough here
the &+Lshadows&n which normally cloak the &+gforest&n floor abate slightly,  the
choking amount of leaves and needles which cover the ground still prevent any
grass from gaining a foothold here.  Hundreds of feet up, a small patch of sky
can be seen between the giant &+gtreetops&n.  It looks as though many caravans
have stopped here to rest, and also like there has been an attempt to cover up
some signs of some sort of activity.  To the north, the path continues to wind
between the trunks of the huge &+gtrees&n.

&+gHidden Ladder on a Giant Tree~
     Cleverly hidden, this ladder leads up the side of one of the larger trees
on the edge of the clearing.  Above, it looks as though some sort of hidden
loft has been build against the trunk of the &+gtree&n.  A few old &+Warrows&n
can be seen sticking from the bottom of the wooden loft, fired up here in what
looks like blind shots from below.

&+gA Hidden Loft~
     This wooden loft has been constucted againstthe side of this giant &+gtree&n.
Large enough for several people to stand on at once, it looks as though it has
been used for the purpose of ambushing resting &+ycaravans&n below.  Seen from
above, the clearing looks like an anciant &+Lcrater&n of some sort.  What caused
the crater, and why none of the trees have reclaimed the clearing is still not
known.

&+gRope Bridge over the Clearing~
     This swinging bridge connects the &+gtree&n loft to some kind of structure
built up in another &+gtree&n of the far side of the clearing.  Made of rope,
the bridge sways back and forth dangerously, and clinging desperately to the
&+Gvines&n which form crude guidewires is highly recommended to keep from falling
to the ground far below.  From this vantage point, other bridges and cleverly
concealed structures can be seen amongst the trees around the clearing.

&+gDeck of a Large &+GTree&+ghouse~
     This is the deck of a very large &+gtreehouse&n, probably used by the local
&+Lbandits&n.  The deck presents a perfect view of the clearing below, but is
probably invisible from the ground.  A dangerous looking &+grope&n bridge leads
over the clearing to the east to another loft, while a door leads west into
this &+gtreehouse&n.  On the north side of the deck, several strong looking
&+Gvines&n are tied to the railing, and look like they stretch several hundred
feet into the air.

&n   This serves as the entry room of the &+Lbandits&n &+gtreehouse&n.  A large
table domitates the central area of the room, while an entryway leads off to
another chamber north.  An argument seems to be coming from the other side of
a sturdy looking door to the west, but it is impossible to make out what is
being said.  The room seems fairly clean and organized as far as &+Lbandit&n
hideouts go.

&+gA Large Storeroom~
&n   This is a large storeroom inside the &+Lbandit&n &+gtreehouse&n, and it is
filled with crates which were once destined for &+gAravne&n.  Many of the stolen
crates have already been pried open, and various melee weapons can be seen
within.  The interesting thing is that it appears that the &+Lbandits&n have
been systematically destroying the merchandise, resulting in a large pile of
broken and twisted swords and &+gbows&n in the center of the floor.  This does
not seem to be very profitable.

group.  A beautiful engraved &+Wplaque&n sits on the corner of the desk.

&+gA Secret Ambush Loft~
&n   This loft has been cleverly hidden against the trunk of this giant &+gTree&n.
It is used by the &+Lbandits&n for the purpose of ambushing caravan groups in
the clearing below.  A &+bsteel&n cable runs from the loft to the ground, for
the purpose in of a lightning fast slide to the ground below, and the chaos
and surprise which would result from such a maneuver.  The clearing is a
dizzying hundred feet below, and the cable looks like it might take both some
practice and some agility to utilize.  In between raids, the &+Lbandits&n use
this loft as a resting place.

along the pathway seems to lie a small, inviting clearing.  The bases of the
&+gtrees&n are growing larger and larger as the path leads ever &+Ldeeper&n into
the ancient &+gforest&n.  Many of them here are already wider than what ten
&+bogres&n could form a ring around, and must be tens of centuries old.

leads off to the east.  The side path looks as though it was once hidden, but
has now been recently enlarged.  How or why this has happened is unknown.

some kind to the east.   The sounds of &+gtree&+Lclimbers&n grows louder in that
direction, evidence that there indeed may be a colony of the creatures there.
The age or purpose of the temple cannot be determined from here, perhaps a

&n   Here the hidden path comes to an end before a &+Lstone&n archway to the
east.  Although the arch still stands, the temple it once served as an entry
to now lies in ruins.  Once what must have been a large building, the walls
now only rise a couple feet high before they end in crumbled stone.  On either
side of the entry arch are the statues of a large &+gT&+Lo&+gr&n.  It seems the
mystical creatures have always been revered.

&n   Here the path takes a sudden split, as a huge &+Lboulder&n lies imbedded
into the forest floor to the north.  Judging by the mass of the stone at its

is blocked by the boulder, and a pair of new paths have been forged to either
side of it.  The path leading out of the &+gforest&n lead back to the south.

looks like a &+Lblack&n &+rlava&n &+Lrock&n, and almost seems to radiate a slight
aura of &+Levil&n.  As the &+gtree&n city of &+gAravne&n is know to be a neutral
trading city, it is mysterious why someone or something would want to block
travel to it.  It seems as though the main path continues to the city around

well traveled or established as the main path south of the fork, but perhaps
this could be due to it being a recent bypass route to &+gAravne&n.

&+gA Meandering Path Through the Trees&n~
&n   As the path curves around countless of the giant &+gtrees&n, it begins to
take away all sense of direction and time.  Due to the size and thickness of
the &+gtrees&n here, it seems as though a careless traveller could get lost
forever in this &+gforest&n.  The howls, cries, and grunts of strange forest
creatures echo and reverberate off of the trunks of the &+gtrees&n, and seem
to come from all directions at once.  The path leads onward endlessly through
the &+gforest&n, without a single sign of &+gAravne&n, or any civilization for
that matter.

&+gDetour in the Main Path~
&n  Here the main path to &+gAravne&n has taken a slight detour around a huge
&+Lboulder&n to the west.  To the north, it continues its winding treck toward
the &+gtree &+Wcity&n, disappearing into the mammoth wood.  Many of the ancient
&+gtrees&n here are covered in moss, and their first branches are nearly out of
sight they are so high up.

&+gMain Path Approaching Aravne~
&n  Here the main path begins to approach the largest of the giant &+gtrees&n,
which hold the &+gtree &+Wcity&n of &+gAravne&n itself.  Even from a distance,
the magnificence of these leviathans is breathtaking.  Still the very same
trees which began this forest, they are now unimaginably old and incredibly
large.  The first of these primordial giants is directly north along the trail,
and blocks most of the rest of the forest ahead behind its massive width.

&n  Here the path comes to an end before one of the primordial &+gtrees&n upon
which the &+gtree &+Wcity&n of &+gAravne&n begins.  The base of this old &+gtree&n is
so wide, that it would take several minutes to walk around to the side of it
and catch a glimpse in the northernly direction.  An worn but sturdy wooden
staircase begins here, and winds its way up and around the trunk to the lowest
level of the &+Wcity&n.

&n  This side path leads around the trunk of the massive &+gtree&n towards a
small clearing full of carts, wagons, and beasts of burden.  The sounds of
many voices can be heard, as well as the occasional fatigue insired argument.
The smell of animal and humanoid sweat grows stronger as the path heads east
toward the unloading zone clearing.  Above, the staircase which begins to the
west spirals its way steadily up the trunk of the tree toward the lowest level
of the &+Wcity&n.

&+gThe &+yCaravan&n &+gUnloading Zone~
&n   Here is where incoming and outgoing trading &+ycaravans&n load and unload
there valueable supplies.  High above several wooden structures can be seen
built in the branches of the giant &+gtree&n, and it appears that there are
even more buildings and bridges high above those.  One of the structures way
above seems to have a square hole cut in the middle of the floor, through
which a long &+bsteel&n cable dangles.  A wooden platform hangs at the end of
the cable, loaded with supplies which are being pulled upwards toward the hole.
Stacks of boxes and crates are piled haphazardly in a semicircle around the
amazing lifts landing place, with more being added constantly.  Several full
wagons are preparing for final departure, while several others are still in
the process of switching incoming and outgoing cargo.  The area reeks of sweat,
and the sounds of grunting workers mixed with the occasional annoying bark of
an order fills the clearing.  Occasionally, a group of workers head off toward
the starway up the tree to the west, speaking loudly of intoxication and of
general mayem.

curves with the trunk slowly northward.  Strange patches of &+Lrot&n and &+Ldisease&n
can be seen on the side of this massive &+gtree&n, extremely unusual for something
which has lived for so long healthily.  Perhaps there is a reason this part of
the &+gforest&n the path leads to is now &+rrestricted&n.

northward into the &+gforest&n &+Lundercity&n.  Before you lie more of the incredibly
massive treetrunks, with a few narrow paths winding between them out of sight
to the north.  Very high above you, where the lowest branches of the trees
begin, wooden structures can be seen stretching out beyond any line of sight.
More patches of &+Lrot&n can be seen on the other &+gtrees&n to the north, and
this part of &+gAravne Forest&n does not seem nearly as peaceful or inviting as
the rest.

gigantic trees it is built upon.  Occasionally a structure can be glimpsed
through the branches far above, branches which are larger than most &+gtrees&n
themselves.  Small patches of rot can be glimpsed on some of the treetrunks,
and there is a definite sense of &+Lforeboding&n here.

&n   Here the path leading north nears the limits of the &+gAravne Forest Guards&n
longbow range, evident by the large amount of spent arrows sticking in the
forest floor here.  Splashes of a dark, sticky dried gook stain many of the
fallen leaves which cover the ground here.  A few &+Wbones&n, gnawed and picked
clean by scavengers lie scattered about here.  To the north, the trunk of one
of the giant trees blocks any view of deeper into the &+gforest&n.

&n   Here the path through the &+gforest &+Lundercity&n splits at the base of an
aptly named &+gAravne&n tree that has been scarred by a recent skirmish which
must have been fought here.  The ground is covered with gnawed bones, both
humanoid and beast.  Several broken weapons, dented suits of armor, and
shredded leather garmets also litter the forest floor here.  The large amount
of &+rblood&n spilled on this spot seems to have permanently discolored the
forest floor here, and the tree seems to have taken on a slightly more twisted,
&+Lwicked&n appearance.  Perhaps blood in the soil is not the preferred diet of
this giant &+gtree&n.

side of &+rB&+Lattl&+re&n &+gTree&n.  The path follows the trunk of the tree southwest,
while to the north it leaves the side of the tree to continue deeper into the
&+gforest&n.  Trails of what look like dried &+rblood&n lead off in the northerly
direction, as if wounded men or &+Lcreatures&n retreated or were perhaps dragged
off in that direction.

&n   To the north, a gathering of ramshackle wooden building known by those in
the &+Wcity&n of &+gAravne&n above as the &+Lpoormen &+rghetto&n can be seen.
An occasional shape can be glimpsed momentarily as it shambles through the
&+rghetto&n before passing out of sight.  Although they appear humanoid from
this distance, they do not move like a normal man, whether poor or not.  South
along the path can be seen &+rB&+Lattl&+re &+gTree&n.

carelessly crafted shacks line both sides of this path as it leads through the
&+rGhetto&n to the north.  The smell which normally accompanies such destitute
communities is present here, along with something a bit more sinister...the
smell of &+Ldeath&n, &+Lrot&n, and &+Ldecay&n.

&+gMain Path Through &+LPoormen&n &+rGhetto&n~
&n   The farther this path leads into this community, the more it seems to
have undergone a hasty abandonment.  Normally home to those so downtrodden
they cannot afford to live even in the &+Wcommons&n &+gdistrict&n of &+gAravne&n,
it seems strange they would face nearly certain starvation by departing here.
But not only do most seem to have left the &+rGhetto&n, they seem to have done
so in a hasty mass exodus judging by the crap these people would consider
priceless just lying discarded on the sides of the trail.

while to the west leads &+rW&+Wi&+Rtc&+rh&n &+groot road&n, and east &+CSettlers Way&n.
A strong odor of &+Ldeath&n and &+Ldecay&n seems to be coming from the east,
and it looks as if things have been dragged along the ground in that direction.

&+gMain Path Through &+LPoormen&n &+rGhetto&n~
&n   Here the path continues on its way through the &+rGhetto&n, leading toward
the central intersection to the south.  On the ground here can be seen signs
of a small &+rskirmish&n, increasingly more obvious to the north.  A bit farther
in that direction can be seen what looks like some kind of fence or barrier
at the northern end of the &+gGhetto&n.  That looks to be where most of
whatever fighting which occurred here took place.

&+gNorthern End of &+LPoormen&n &+rGhetto&n~
&n   Here the main path through the &+rGhetto&n leads out deeper into the &+gforest&n
&+Lundercity&n to the north.  A small makeshift barrior looks to have been
erected here by the residents to protect them from whatever menace lies
beyond.  It does not appear to have been effective, as it now lies smashed
and broken, further testament to the slovenly workmanship of the poor who
appear to have died defending it.  A serious battle was fought here, and lost,
by the residents of &+LPoormen &+rGhetto&n, and the corpses seem to have
been dragged off to the south either by greiving survivors or more likely by
whoever smashed through their forces.  No natural &+gforest&n creature could
have done this.  A strange and &+Ltwisted&n looking &+gundergrowth&n seems to have
recently sprung up to the north, making further travel to the north difficult
as well as &+rdangerous&n.

&+gAn Abandoned &+yShack&n~
&n   This makeshift dwelling smells of filth, and is littered by bug infested
furs and cowls.  It is hard to imagine any intelligent being living here, or
having the means to move without taking all of their possessions with them.
The motives of the poor can often be difficult to second guess, however.

&+CSettlers Way&n~
&n   This stretch of pathway through the &+Lpoorman&n &+rghetto&n connects the
center of the settlement to the west and the &+Lrot&+Wyard&n to the east.  The
ground along the path here has been stained a reddish color from recent &+rblood&n
soaking into it, and is spotted by the occasional chunk of still wet &+Ggore&n.
Many sets of what appear to be &+gT&+ro&+gr&n &+cfootprints&n lead off in the easterly
direction, while nearly twice as many appear to have traveled back to the
west.

&+CSettlers Way Approaching the &+LRot&+Wyard&n~
&n   The &+Gp&+gu&+Gtr&+gi&+Gd&n smell of the &+Lrot&+Wyard&n to the east wafts in on a slight
breeze, an even more unpleasant odor than that of the stench of the trash
laden main path through the &+rghetto&n.  Again here are the strange sets
of &+gT&+ro&+gr&n &+cfootprints&n, some leading east with twice the number leading back
to the west.  A recently abandoned building called the &+CSettlers Tavern&n, the
only business in the entire &+rghetto&n lies to the north.

&+CCommons Room of Settlers Tavern&n~
&n   This old &+Ctavern&n is constructed entirely of wooden planks which were
cast down from the the city of &+gAravne&n and salvaged.  Many of the floorboards
are uneven or broken, a few with &+yrusted&n nails poking through.  Several
areas on the floor are covered with what look like dried &+rbloodstains&n.  It
is obvious by the still half full bottles of cheap &+Bs&+bp&+Bi&+br&+Bi&+bt&+Bs&n still on display
behind the rickety bar that whatever caused the abandonment of this tavern
instilled enough &+Lterror&n that nobody has returned.  The wooden bar lies on
the north side of the room, while a set of rickety stairs leads to a loft
above.

&+CBehind the Bar in Settlers Tavern&n~
&n   The bar itself is made of mismatched chunks of wood thrown together
without an extreme amount of skill or planning.  Permanently stained by years
of uncleaned drink spills, it is &+Gsticky&n to the touch.  The north wall is
covered with rickity, uneven shelves holding bottles of cheap &+Bs&+bp&+Bi&+br&+Bi&+bt&+Bs&n,
some still containing liquids.  More noticeable however, are two &+Rblood&n soaked
&+Lcorpses&n lying on top of each other behind the bar.  One is a hideous looking
half-human half-tor mutant of some kind, probably a &+Llycanthrope&n.  Below it
lies &+BB&+borgnors&+Bh&n, the now deceased tavernkeeper.  His body mauled, it
looks as though the well liked man was still alive when he defeated the
&+LW&+re&+Lr&+re&+Lt&+ro&+Lr&n beside him.  It appears as though his rumored talents in alchemy
were not enough to stave off his own transformation, and he took his
own life.

&+CRickety Loft inside Settlers Tavern&n~
&n   Here the wooden staircase up from the main room of the tavern has ended
in a small loft.  Trails of &+rblood&n leading from below end in large still
wet pools, staining the &+gleaves&n which make up bedding here a dark red color.
Chunks of the &+gleaf&n bedding are strewn across the room, ripped from the mat
by some vicious struggle.  A broken chunk of &+Wm&+cirro&+Wr&n hangs crookedly
on the north wall next to several different colored wigs.

&+WEntr&+Lance&n &+Wto the &+LRot&+Wyard&n~
&n   The &+Gstench&n here is overpowering, ripe with &+Ldeath&n and &+Ldecay&n, a bright
beacon for all things &+Gfoul&n in intent or substance.  The forest floor here has
turned into a disgusting marsh of &+Lrot&n, and the ground is littered with scores
of corpses in various stages of decay.  The floor here is probably a foot
thick with decomposed &+rflesh&n and &+Wbone&n, making it obvious that they do not
think much of actual burial here in the &+rghetto&n.  There are an unusually high
number of fresh corpses here, perhaps dragged here from a recent battle.  A
slight &+cm&+Wi&+cst&n clings to the ground, obscuring what look like moving shapes
elsewhere inside the &+Lrot&+Wyard&n.  Perhaps more care should have been taken with
these recent additions to this field of death, as strange &+gt&+ro&+gr&n like footprints
abound here in restless patterns.

&+rW&+Li&+Rtc&+rh&n &+gRoot Road&n~

toward one of the giant trees to the west.  Several strange &+Wt&+Lo&+Bt&+We&+Lm&+Bs&n line
the side of the path at periodic intervals.  It is not apparent which way
their warding effect is intended to be focused, but due to the low amount of
travel which seems to have taken place here they have been effective.

in the westward direction that the path collides with the mammoth tree whose
unusual root formation gives this road its name.

&+gPath Beside &+rW&+Wi&+Rtc&+rh&n &+GRoot&n~
&n  Here the path bends around &+rW&+Wi&+Rtc&+rh&n &+GRoot&n, heading off into the &+gforest&n to
both the east and west.  The gigantic tree to the north is the origin of the
huge root the path bends around.  More massive than scores of normal trees in
itself, &+rW&+Wi&+Rtc&+rh&n &+gRoot&n erupts from the earth here and rises fifty feet into
the air before it bends perpendicular to the ground and attaches to the rest
of the tree approximately the same distance to the north.  It is not this
feature that gives the root its name however, but rather the fact that inside
the sizable cleft underneath and between the root and trunk a reputed &+rw&+Wi&+Rtc&+rh&n
has made her home for several centuries.  A wall made entirely of twined &+gleaves&n
covers the gap between root, trunk, and ground, and is marked only by a single
small flap in the center.  Obviously something lives there.

&n   This is the entry parlor of the ancient witch &+RB&+We&+Rthr&+We&+Rz&+We&+Rl&n, now thought
by most to be either dead or to have moved on to other worlds.  The southern
wall of the room is made entirely of woven &+gleaves&n, sheltering this abode
from the elements.  The ceiling is the root itself, polished and stained to
reflect the complexity of the living wood.  An iron cauldron simmers above
a strange magical fire in the west corner, and a worktable is cluttered with
half filled containers.  A large &+gvine&n rug covers much of the floor, giving
the room a cozy look.  A wall made entirely of hanging strings of beads
separates the room from what looks to be another chamber to the north.

mysterious aura.  The bark ceiling slopes downward toward the north, and the

The northern half of the room is filled with plush cushions and blankets, and
the southern decorated by a myriad of &+Ws&+ci&ng&+ci&+Wls&n and &+br&nu&+bn&ne&+bs.

&+rW&+Wi&+Rtc&+rh&n &+gRoot&n to the east, signifying the halfway point between the &+Lpoorman&n
&+rghetto&n and the &+Lundercity&n &+gdump landing&n.  A small tendril of smoke curls up
from the center of the &+groot&n and heads lazily toward the branches high above,
perhaps a sign that somebody lives within the &+groot&n itself.  To the west, the
faint smell of &+Lrotting &+Ggarbage&n can be detected.

intersection with another path to the west.  Farther away to the east along
the trail one of the giant &+gAravne trees&n can be seen, along with what appears
to be a strange above ground section of root.  The stench of the &+Lundercity&n
&+gdump landing&n is fairly strong here, as the source is probably just beyond
the westward intersection.

path leading in from the east.  Continuing north, the main path seems to end
just ahead where two of the &+garavne trees&n grow only a wagons width apart from
each other.  The stench of &+Lrot&n and &+Ggarbage&n wafts in from that direction,
evidence that the &+Ldump &+glanding&n probably lies just beyond.

&+gTwin Tree Gateway to the &+LDump &+gLanding&n~
&n   Here the path leads between two towering &+garavne trees&n, leaving barely
enough room for a wagon to pass between.  A makeshift wooden gate spans the
slight distance between the trunks, making this passage an easily defensible
position.  Beyond the gate to the north lies one of the most massive &+Ggarbage&n
&+Ldumping&n site in all the realms, and a heaven for the &+Gthri&n-&+Ykreen&n tribe
which has claimed it as their property and home.

&+gSouthern Entry of the &+LDump&n &+gLanding&n~
&n   Just north of the southern gate and the &+gtwin trees&n which frame it, the
&+Ldump&n spans the entire northern arc of view.  Busy looking &+Gthri&n-&+Ykreen&n sift
through the &+Ggarbage&n for usefull or possibly valueable items, &+Ggarbage&n which
is replenished weekly when it is dumped from the city of &+gAravne&n above.  It
appears that, while most of the trash is allowed to pile up, the main pathways
through the &+Ldump&n are kept clear to aid travel.  It seems as though one
persons &+Gtrash&n really is another persons &+Ytreasure&n.

&+gCustoms Office&n~
&n   This is the village &+gcustoms&n office, used as a resting place for off duty
&+gcustoms&n &+Yguards&n.  A large desk, looking as though it were recently dragged
off of one of the &+Ggarbage&n piles is covered with sheets of completely illegible
notes.  A tally sheet of the daily arrivals is posted on the wall.

&n   This small area has been entirely cleared of trash, allowing a small
gathering of &+Gthri&n-&+Ykreen&n to show off their recent aquisitions in the hopes
of a lucrative trade.  Here is where visitors from the &+Lpoorman &+rghetto&n acquire
what little valuables they own, trading worthless &+cbaubles&n for more needed
items of utility.

which are open to the &+Wpublic&n.  Large heaps of &+Ggarbage&n block any passage
east or west, while the &+gsouthern intersection&n lies to the north.  The giant

&n   This section of the side path is remarkably clear of debris, perhaps due
to the fact that the structures facing it both north and south are constucted
completely from &+Ggarbage&n.  The smell of cooking meat wafts in from the north
building, mingling with the &+Gstench&n of the &+Ldump&n with a rather nauseating
effect.

burns in the center, covered by a metal rack.  Cooking on the rack are several
unidentified strips of &+rflesh&n, while hanging even higher up other strips of
meat are being slowly smoked.  Inside the room, the powerful aromas of the
sizzling food completely drown out the &+Gstench&n from outside, making this
perhaps the only pleasant room in the entire &+Ldump&n.

shambles.  Gutted by &+Rfire&n, probably set after the looting was finished, it
now contains nothing of any value.  Even choice pieces of the walls have been

is perhaps the only room in this small village which is not build with trash.
A large desk crafted from the wood of an &+garavne tree&n sits on the south side

&n   For a weapons store, this place sure does seem to be cranking out a lot
of business.  The shelves are completely bare except for a few specialty arms,
while newly arrived crates of murchandise are already spoken for before they
even hit the showroom.  The brisk business here is a reminder that this
village is just a small island of &+ctranquility&n in an otherwise &+rchaotic&n world.

looks very unhealty.  The occasional &+Gthri&n-&+Ykreen&n completely immerses itself
in the pool, then leaps out and shakes itself dry picking off the stray &+gleech&n
off its body.

&n   Here the &+gforktree&n rises skyward, beginning as two separate trunks which
merge together at a height of about thirty feet.  This natural but unusual
phenomena has produced a perfect gateway for the north side of the &+Ldump&n.  It
seems that the &+Gthri-&+Ykreen&n have recently had to defend this gate, as there are
signs of battle on the northern side of the &+gforktree&n.  The defense must have
been successful, as the &+Ldump&n village still remains unscathed.  Judging by
the increased security here, hovever, it does not appear as though the &+rthreat&n
was completely eliminated.

this space below a natural gateway.  The entire passage beneath the &+gforktree&n
has been lined by rows of sharp wooden stakes, angled to the north.  &+RImpaled&n
upon one of the stakes lies the &+Lhideous&n and &+Gdecomposing&n body of a &+Lw&+re&+Lr&+re&+Lt&+ro&+Lr&n.
Were the &+Lundercity&n &+gforest&n not so naturally protected from the &+Ysun&n, this corpse
would probably have decomposed long ago.  Just to the north the widely spaced
giant &+garavne treetrunks&n by a strange and &+Lma&+rl&+Levo&+rl&+Lent&n looking undergrowth
of choking &+gvines&n.  The growth seems to be new, and reduces all visibilty
to the north to nearly nothing.

&+gPath Through the &+LMa&+rl&+Levo&+rl&+Lent &+gUndergrowth&n~
&n   Here the path through the twisted mass of &+gundergrowth&n leads off to the
north.  The telltale bits of &+Rbloody&n cloth and strands of hair hanging from
the &+gundergrowth&n hint at visions of &+rfallen&n &+Wdefenders&n screaming in terror
as they are dragged off to their fate.

&+gPath Through the &+LMa&+rl&+Levo&+rl&+Lent&n &+gUndergrowth&n~
&n   Here the path through the &+gundergrowth&n meets up with the trunk of an
&+garavne&n tree, and follows the curve of the trunk through the mass of &+gvines&n.
This &+gtree&n seems different from the others, as its bark seems to have a
&+Ltwisting&n, &+rwicked&n look to it.  Patches of &+Grot&n speckle the entire visible
section of the trunk, and it seems to produce a nearly inaudible &+Wmoaning&n
sound, as though it were being &+rtortured&n.  Foul &+cmagics&n are most assuredly
at work here.

&+gPath Through the &+LMa&+rl&+Levo&+rl&+Lent&n &+gUndergrowth&n~
&n   Here the path plunges back into the &+gundergrowth&n, leaving the &+Ltwisted&n
trunk of the &+garavne tree&n behind.  The beastly footprints are inceased here,
and the occasional torn piece of &+Rbloody &+Wcloth&n can still be seen snagged
on protruding branches of &+gundergrowth&n.  It almost seems as though the &+gplant&n
life here is hungry and actively seeking &+Wflesh&n and &+Rblood&n.

&+gAn Intersection of Paths Through the Undergrowth&n~
&n   Here the twisting path through the menacing &+gundergrowth&n comes to an
intersection, with the main path continuing north and south.  The torn pieces
of cloth and drops of blood appear to continue down the eastern fork, however.
The footprints of what look like mutated &+gT&+ro&+gr&n seem to lead off in every
direction, however.

&+gSide Path Through the &+LMa&+rl&+Levo&+rl&+Lent&n &+gUndergrowth&n~
&n   This small side path seems to forge a more bulky and haphazard route
through the mass of &+Le&+rv&+Li&+rl&n looking &+gvines&n and &+gweeds&n.  The amount of &+Wcloth&n,
&+Rblood&n, and small chunks of &+Grotting&n &+Wflesh&n scattered here along the trail
seem to increase the farther east one travels along this terrible path.  The
simple fact that the normal &+gforest&n scavengers have left this bounty untouched
hints at the danger here.  The sounds of crunching bones and tearing flesh
seeming to come from the east may actually be the sounds of something far more
innocent, warped and twisted by the mind to further complete the &+cillusion&n of
&+rcarnage&n begun by the flesh &+Grotting&n here.  Or maybe the sounds are real
after all.

&+gThe &+LHideous&n &+gFeeding Grounds of the &+LW&+re&+Lr&+re&+Lt&+ro&+Lr&n~
&n   A small clearing has been forged in the &+Lma&+rl&+Levo&+rl&+Lent&n &+gundergrowth&n here,
revealing a scene of such intense &+rcarnage&n even one of the fabled &+bogre
&+rberserkers&n of &+rKayeth Kanaz&n would have been awestruck.  The bodies of
both &+Chuman&n and &+Gthri-&+Ykreen&n lie strewn and piled about the clearing, some
of them completely &+rdismembered&n, the pieces thrown in &+rbloody&n piles.  The
smell of &+Lrot&n and &+Ldecay&n hangs here, like the intense pressure of sea
water.  Perhaps the corpses of those who died defending their homes and loved
ones are not what is &+Lfrigtening&n to behold here, as the sight of the huge
and mutated &+Lw&+re&+Lr&+re&+Lt&+ro&+Lr&n ripping them open and eating them is like a &+mvision&n from
a &+Ln&+ri&+Lghtm&+ra&+Lre&n.

&n   This hidden passage through the &+gundergrowth&n appears to have been the
escape route for some very &+Glucky&n hopeful victim of the &+Lw&+re&+Lr&+re&+Lt&+ro&+Lr&n.
Dried &+Rblood&n is crusted over some of the fallen &+gleaves&n that scatter the
ground, and small scrapes have been made in the soft earth as if by clawing
fingers.

and reaching out.  The bits of flesh and torn pieces of cloth are no longer
present here, although small puddles of &+Rblood&n soak into the &+gforest&n floor.
Totaly absent here are the signs of the &+gforest&n &+ycreatures&n which normally
inhabit the area.

&+gTerrible Scene in the &+LMa&+rl&+Levo&+rl&+Lent&n &+gUndergrowth&n~
&n   Here the reason for the unusual absence of &+gforest &+ycreatures&n is revealed,
as several small animal &+Wskeletons&n hang suspended in the &+gundergrowth&n.  One
small &+Whopper&n looks to be only recently deceased, the last breath of life
squeezed out of him by the terrible &+gplantlife&n.  All around the &+Whopper&n
new growth swarms,  and like an insect caught in a terrible web the pitiful
animal is being leeched of all its juices.  Soon all that will be left is a
&+Wskeleton&n, and the &+gundergrowth&n will seek out new prey.

&+gCurve near a Clearing in the Undergrowth&n~
&n   Here the trail through the &+gundergrowth&n widens out a bit, and curves to
the east.  Around the curve a small clearing can be seen, with several &+Ldark&n
shapes moving through the &+ctwilight&n which filters through the hundreds of huge
branches high above.  The clearing seems to end in a dark, twisted wall of
some kind.

&+gClearing at the Base of the &+WPrime &+gTree&n~
&n   This is a small clearing in the &+Lma&+rl&+Levo&+rl&+Lent&n &+gundergrowth&n,
before the base of the &+Wprime &+garavne tree&n.  The origional tree of the
entire &+gforest of aravne&n, it is the one from which all the others here can
trace their roots.  Once mighty and beautiful to look upon, it now suffers
from some strange sickness.  &+cMagical&n in nature, and with eons and eons of
wisdom to guide the &+cmagic&n, the &+Wprime &+gtree&n cannot be affected by
anything save a very strong and very &+Levil&n &+rcurse&n.  Yet afflicted it is,
as some stretches of &+ybark&n are &+Ltwisted&n and bleed sap, while other patches of
&+ybark&n have simply &+Lrotted&n away.  The &+gt&+ro&+gr&n which normally feed upon the bark
which the &+Wprime &+Ltree&n freely gives, probably were afflicted with their terrible
form of &+Llycanthropy&n by eating the &+Lrotted&n &+ybark&n.  Even as the &+gtree&n fights a
losing battle against the &+rcurse&n, it projects a constant &+cthought&n, a &+cvision&n
of &+Wgoodness&n and &+Wpurity&n beautiful to behold and look upon.

thought vision~
&n   The &+cvision&n momentarily becomes &+Wreality&n, and suddenly an empty and
desolate &+yfield&n stretches out in all directions.  It appears to be a &+gfarm&n
of some kind, although it obviously suffers from a severe lack of water.  A
man which appears to be a &+gfarmer&n is standing in front of a small child eating
a piece of dry looking &+Mfruit&n.  The two figures are facind different directions,
and the child must suffer from deafness because he never turns around as the
&+gfarmer&n attacks a fierce looking wolf and is struck down.  Suddenly the
meaning of the &+cvision&n becomes &+Wclear&n as the magic intesifies with the
emotion present in its content.  The child hears not on the levels of &+Chumans&n,
but instead shares a rapport with plants and animals, apparent as he turns
around and cries out at what his best friend the wolf has done to his father.
The wolf, having struck only in self defence at the boy's father who thought
he was saving his sons life, slumps over mortally wounded.  As the boy runs to
the two bodies the piece of &+Mfruit&n falls from his grasp into the soft earth.
Sobbing over the loss of both his best friend and his father in senseless
tragedy, his tears flow across his face and come to rest on the half eaten
piece of &+Mfruit&n.  Suddenly the &+cvision&n begins to accelerate its timeline,
and as the years fly past in only moments, a wonderous tree springs from the
earth where the &+Mfruit&n had lain and grows a thousand feet into the &+Wsky&n.
Fading out, the &+cvision&n turns back to &+Wreality&n, and leaves only the knowledge
that the watcher has seen the creation of the &+Wprime &+gtree&n.

&+gOn a &+yWooden &+gStaircase&n~
&n   Here the staircase is even with the eastern side of the &+garavne tree&n, and
has climbed fifty feet from the &+gforest&n floor.  The size of the trunk is so
great that by the time it climbs another fifty feet to the lowest branches it
will barely have curved to the north face.  Far below, the &+ycaravan&n unloading
zone can be seen east of the tree.

&+gEntrance to the &+WCommons &+gDistrict&n~
&n   Here, against the north side of the entrance tree, lies the entrance to the
&+Wcommons &+gdistrict&n.  The lowest level of the &+gtree &+Wcity&n of &+gAravne&n, it
the least fortunate of the residents reside.  The bulk of industrial work, and
other functions neccessary to the maintenance of the city but not pleasing to
behold by &+Wcity &+cnobles&n are done at this level.  Wooden structures
spiderweb into the lower branches in every direction to the north, looking
both spectacular in inginuity and confusing in actuality at the same time.  A
spiral staircase winds down along the trunk of the &+gtree&n to the &+gforest&n
&+gfloor&n, while a broad platform extends out from the top of the steps.  Skyways,
the wooden walkways which connect the structures here, lead off to both the
north and east.

view of the &+gforest&n floor can occasionally be glimpsed through gaps in the

this skyway is at the lower altitudes of the &+Wcity&n, it would still be a very

&+gThe &+yCargo &+gPulley Platform&n~
&n   Square shaped, and braced heavily above a particularly wide lower branch,
this wooden platform is well suited for its function.  A large wooden spindle
is turned horizontally, and wound around it a couple hundred feet of magical
&+bsteel&+gvine&n rope.  A wide trapdoor stands open in the center of the platform,
which the vine dangles through.  Several dozen large &+ycrates&n which have been
recently pulleyed up from the &+gforest&n floor are stacked here, waiting to be
moved into the large wharehouse to the east.

filled with &+Lcobwebs&n and &+ydust&n, this does not look like a very inviting

&+gThe &+WCommons&n &+gDistrict Free Market&n~
&n   This is a section of the sprawling mass of platforms and walkways known
as the &+Wcommons&n &+gdistrict free market&n.  Usually the first place that
new goods are sold in &+garavne&n due to its proximity to the loading platform,
this marketplace is bustling with business.  The lack of local tarrifs or
taxes on trade here has resulted in a wonderous marketplace filled with free
enterprise.  Instead of large and well established shops, the bulk of the
market is made up of fast dealing salesman who both buy and sell wares to make
their living.  A crafty and shrewd business mind could thrive in this place,
and it appears a few such have been able to establish permanent businesses
here and there.

&+bGungols &+gDrink and Drop Stop&n~
&n   The strange name becomes apparent within seconds of entry into this rowdy
tavern.  Except for the floor, it looks much the same as any such &+yalehouse&n
in the realm.  There problem is that there are square holes cut through the
floor surrounded by short railings around which the seats are all situated.
Through the holes the forest floor can be seen a couple hundred feet below,
and it is also through the holes that all of the empty &+yale&n tankards are
tossed once they are empty.  This would be a costly waste except that the
tankards are made of &+garavne leaves&n, which are in endless supply here.  So
the benefits to a drunk of destructive entertainment coupled with convenient
puke holes have seemed to far outweigh the cost of constructing more mugs.  It
is amazing a dozen drunks dont stumble to their death each day, instead of the
actual figures of a dozen a year.

&+gLunchtime &+ySquare &+gin the Free Market&n~
&n   A miniature version of the &+rbaazar&n, this platform is even more crowded.
Once used as a side platform for the merchants to have a break and grab meals,
this place has now evolved into a madhouse of food vendors and hungry traders.
Nowhere else in the entire realm can so many different cultures culinary
delights be found in such proximity.  The tantalizing smells fill the air, and
are so strong they have been known to send visiting &+bogre&n's and &+gtroll&n's into
&+rfrenzies&n.  One such vendor has experiences such success they have become
a permanent establishment here, and his restaurant now dominates the western
half of the square.  The sign hanging over the door reads: &+gThe &+yMerchants&n &+gMeal&n.

&+gThe &+yMerchants &+gMeal&n~
&n   The most highly successful restaurant in the &+Wcommons &+gdistrict&n, and
perhaps in all of &+gAravne&n in terms of sheer volume, this building is packed
with customers.  A long wooden bar stretches the entire west side of the room,
and is kept constantly stocked with over thirty hot and cold foods.  The smell
of cooking food wafts out from the &+Rkitchen&n behind the bar, and seems to
permeate the entire restaurant.  Long wooden tables fill the room, many of
them completely filled with customers.  The sounds of talking and merriment
echo throughout the room, giving it a very &+rfestive&n and &+ycozy&n feel.

&+gThe Restaurant &+WKitchen&n~
&n   The smell of cooking food is even more overpowering here in the service
area and &+Wkitchen&n of the restaurant.  There is a high level of energy here,
as the &+Wchef&n and his line &+Wcooks&n work quickly and efficiently to keep
up with the volume of business.  Clearly visible in the entranceway of the
&+Wkitchen&n is a sign which reads: &+RAbsolutely NO &+gTrolls&n, as the damage
from the last 'incident' is still being repaired.

&+gSkyway in the &+WCommons &+gDistrict Free Market&n.~

of platforms and structures throughout the free market.  The constant sounds
of fervent trading seem to further confuse the mind, and it is easily seen
how an inexperienced traveller could quickly become lost, confused, and broke.

the eastern edge of this platform lies an old, slightly run down building out
of which wander some fairly &+rsuspicious&n looking characters.

&+rSalvadars &+gFree Tavern&n~
&n   Not one of the nicest and cleanest taverns in the &+gtree &+Wcity&n, it is yet
one of the most popular.  This is mainly due to the fact that &+rSalvadar&n, the
tavern proprieter, ensures through both &+ybribes&n and &+rthreats&n that the privacy
and lack of interference necessary for smooth conduction of patron "business"
is maintained.  The tavern is full, yet does not carry nearly the volume of
noise that most others have.  A doorway leads out onto what looks like some
sort of patio to the east, and a set of stairs next to the bar leads down to
&+rSalvadars&n office and &+mwine&n &+gcellar&n.

stand huddled together in small private groups discussing "business".  Unlike
most of the platforms in &+gAravne&n which have short walls or railings to allow
breathtaking views into the foliage before, &+rSalvadars&n &+Wpatio&n instead opts
for a high, solid wooden wall to allow total privacy.  Dark &+Rred&n stains, old
and new, scatter the old wooden floor, and not all of them look like they are
made from &+gleaf&+mwine&n.

&n   Built of strong, thick wood, this home rests at the lowest branching of
the tree.  A heavy trapdoor in the floor leads out of the home and down to
the connecting skyways below.  It is not very decorated, and has few
furnishings other than a simple bunk, some cupboards, and a table.  Not the
dwelling of a wealthy individual by any means, it is nonetheless a noteworthy
accomplishment to own ones own &+Whome&n on a &+Whome &+gtree&n, even down here
in the &+Wcommons &+gdistrict&n.

&+gSkyway Connecting the &+WHome &+gTrees and &+RGrand Walk&n~
&n   This skyway, unlike their swinging rope supported cousins connecting the
&+Whome &+gtrees&n to the south, is wide and sturdy.  Thick wooden planks are
supported by &+Bsteel&n aerial cables and giant aravne wood beams.  To the north it
connects with the largest walkway in the &+WCommons &+gDistrict&n, the &+RGrand Way&n.

the rest of the marketplace, or the southern skyway toward the &+WHome &+gTrees&n.
To the east, the &+RGrand Way&n continues toward the &+BGr&+Cea&+Bt St&+Cai&+Brw&+Ca&+By&n.

&+gSkyway Connecting the Free Tavern and &+RGrand Way&n~
&n   This skyway is made of solid planks, and zigzags slightly from its north
south route.  This is because instead of being supported by ropes, cables, and
beams, it is supported by a thick branch off of a nearby tree.  To the south,
lies the entry way to the &+WCommons &+gDistrict&n from the rest of the &+Wcity&n.

center of Aravne.  Due to its size and the weight it must support, it takes
a rather windy route northward through the wide central branches of the great
&+gAravne trees&n.  Just to the north it takes an eastward detour around one
of the gigantic tree trunks before following one of the wide branches that
stretches out northwards.

away from the trunk in an eastward direction.  Once over the hump the skyway
again leads off to the north, following the course of another of the huge

Beyond that, not much can be made out due to the thickness of branches which

A relatively smaller branch (only the thickness of a small house) crosses over
the top of the giant branch which supports &+RThe Grand &+cSkyway&n, and heads
off into the thick tangle of trees and branches to the west.  While the main
skyway rises over the branch and continues northward, a smaller skyway curves

&n   As the branch supporting this massive skyway begins to curve downward
here, either on its own initiative or as a result of the weight of the giant
skyway and a few hundred years, the skyway does not follow it.  Instead, a
mass of wooden structural beams have been built one on top of the other, on
top of which the skyway continues to the north at a more level pace, where
just ahead it intersects another massive branch which heads northwest.

the natural support provided by it.  An east leading side branch provides the
support for a smaller skyway, known as &+gHome Avenue&n, which leads off into

seems to come to another intersection marked by some sort of construction.

&n   The giant branch which proves the support for the middle section of the
large skyway has suffered a devastating crack here some few centuries ago.
While back to the southeast the branch appears vigorous, and actually supports
&+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n, here its days of supporting skyways are over.   The crack and
sagging of the giant branch has given way to many medium sized branches, over
which &+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n continues in a northerly direction.  &+WMerchants &+CWay&n
also intersects here, and leads off to the &+WMerchants District&n west of here.

the west instead.  Whether some old force of nature, or perhaps an unnatural
force caused this change in route, has long since faded from the memories of
the old.

&+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n~
&n   Here the skyway effects its detour around the dense foliage which causes
the immense tangle of branches to the northeast.   A gentle but long curve,
the result is nearly a right angle, with the skyway continuing on its way in
both the north and easterly directions.  To the north the skyway appears to
follow a straightforward northerly route, and several intersections can be
made out in the distance in that direction.

&+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n~
&n   This part of &+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n marks the beginning of a long straight
gentle rise toward the &+cNobles District&n and the &+gPrime Tree of Aravne&n.  Small
spots of &+Lrot&n are beginning to dot the branches here,  but otherwise all
seems to be normal.   Just ahead to the north another skyway intersects with
&+RThe Grand &+CWay&n, but beyond that not much can be seen.

&+gIntersection of &+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n &+gand Home Avenue&n~
&n   Here the skyway is joined by &+gHome Avenue&n, which leads off to the east.
Small spots of &+Lrot&n are evident on some of the branches here, and there is
just the hint of tension here, where in a residential setting there is usually
none.  Farther along &+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n to the north a glint of &+Ysunlight&n
fights its way down through a small gap in the &+gfoliage&n.

&+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n~
&n   Here, and farther north, there is much less business traffic on the skyway.
While the main commercial and residential sections of &+gAravne&n are now left
behind to the south, the tension in the air seems increased here without that
gentle buzz of commerce.  A few slender rays of &+Ysunlight&n lance down through
a gap in the &+gfoliage&n to the north, counterbalancing the undeniable sense
of something being just a tiny bit wrong in this place.

&+rDragonfall &+LPit&n &+gon &+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n~
&n   Always thought to be a tavern rumor until witnessed in the flesh, this
place is truly on of the greatest sights to behold in the region.  A gaping
swath through the massive branches of &+gAravne&n was cut in a blaze of &+rheat&n
and &+rmomentum&n, created by an &+rancient red dragon&n as it fell to its
death in the wizards war centuries ago.  It was here that its momentum through
the branches began to slow, and eventually stop a few hundred feet below.
This created both a gap in the &+gAravne foliage&n above, and a two hundred
foot hole below, known as &+rDragonfall &+LPit&n.  Although the trees have
made some headway in closing the rift, &+YSunlight&n still manages to lance its
way down through the remaining gaps.  A witness to the incredible event saw
direct &+Ysunlight&n for the first time in his life on that day, and looked
eye to eye with &+YSolos&n, &+ygod of &+Ysunlight&n.  Instantly filled with faith and
belief, he founded the &+yTemple of the &+YSun&n, which placed its front doors here
just to the west.

which winds through the &+gWilds&n to the east.  The rate of ascention to the
north increases dramatically, as &+RThe Grand &+CSkyway&n makes its final climb
towards the &+cnobles district&n and the &+gPrime Tree&n.

as a point of attachment for many dangling tools and apparatus.  A well of
murky water built from thick stone occasionally belches out steam as a red
hot chunk of iron or steel is dropped into it.  This does not seem to be a
very pleasant place to observe the art of blacksmithing, which does not bother
the tradesmen working here in the least.

&+GThe Apothecary&n~
&n   This room has a ceiling made completely of glass, absolutly necessary
considering the entire room is filled with a plethora of different plantlife.
Some of the plants themselves are behind glass, and whether this is for the
plants protection or for the customers protection is unclear.  A glass cabinet
on the far side of the room holds several large jars full of bubbling and
churning elixers, and a small side closet appears to be a makeshift laboratory.
This is definitely the place to come if you are in need of a potion, as several
of the types of plants here can be found only within the &+gforest&n of &+gAravne&n.

evolved as more and more residents moved into the area.  The only possible way

&+gAn Aravne Home&n~
&n   This treehouse residence looks very cozy and safe.  Nestled here within
the branches, it is made completely of strong &+gAravne&n wood.  A fireplace sits
in the center of the living area surrounded by &+gleaf&+Lstone&n.  The beds are
hammocks suspended from rungs in the ceiling, and look extremely comfortable.
Entrance and exit to the treehouse can be made through various holes cut in the
walls, instead of a single doorway as most landside homes are likely to have.
Light is reflected into the dwelling from panels of large shiny leaves which
are suspended near the windows, reflecting ambient light into the living area.
Glass baubles filled with glowing bugs also hang from the ceiling, providing
an eerie light during the night hours.

&+gEntrance to the Wilds&n~
&n   Here home avenue comes to a stop.  Several abandoned homes are falling
into disarray, and a makeshift barricade has been constructed barring easy
entrance from the wilds to the east.  Once a favorite hunting grounds, the
wilds have also been affected by the strange evil invading the forest, and are
now unsafe to travel.  Currently a stalemate has been effected between the
home district and the wilds, preventing further encroachment into civilized
areas.

&+gThe Wilds&n~
&n   &+LChaos&n and &+Ldarkness&n.  There is no other way to describe the tangle
of growth that shoots and curls in every direction here.  New, more sinister
growth explodes through every opening possible, enveloping the already dense
tangles of branches.  The skyway here is more of a makeshift path than anything
expected to survive the years, and is constantly being modified by detours and
new construction.  This does not seem like a good place to get lost, but even
the most experienced rangers have been known to lose their way here.  Further
compounding the confusion are the constant attacks from the new residents of
the area.

&+gBefore the Tree of &+WJustice&n~
&n   This narrow skyway still remains untouched by the ravages of the wilds.  A
long circular stairway leads upward as it spirals its way around the trunk of
the &+gTree of &+WJustice&n.  A strong feeling of &+Ygoodness&n and &+Wpeace&n emanates
from what lies above, perhaps a remnant of the magic of &+Wjustice&n which was
weaved into the spirit of this tree long ago by forest elves.  Once guarded by
the mighty &+YKi-rin&n, it has not been used by the residents of &+gAravne&n for many
years.  Perhaps the &+YKi-rin&n still defend it from entry by all those who are
not of pure innocence.

&n   Much like a smaller version of the grand skyway, this spiral stairway
steeply curves its way around the &+gTree of &+WJustice&n.  The wooden steps are
stained red by the blood of the guilty, as only one woman has ever passed these
steps without withstanding the might of the &+YKi-rin&n which guard its top.
Scars from missed sword attacks are evident in both the railing and the bark
of the tree.

far, none have ever seen what lies above and returned alive.

&+YThe Platform of &+WJustice&n~
&n   Only a few mortals have ever seen this platform, due to the vigilance and
dedication of the &+YKi-rin&n which protect the sanctity of the tree.  A wide
nest of what looks like &+Ywoven gold&n dominates the far side of the platform,
upon which sits a majestic female &+YKi-rin&n, the first female of the species
witnessed by mortal eyes save one innocent girl.  The &+rblood&n of the &+Lwicked&n
stains the near side of the platform, into which &+Ygold&+W sigils&n have been
inscribed.  A huge, golden two-handed sword rests at the foot of the nest,
sparkling with its own light.  How many mortal souls have reached their final
rest, dispatched by that beautiful blade, can never be counted.

&+gEntrance to the &+LAbandoned &+bMansion&n~
&n   This northerly detour off of &+gHome Avenue&n must have once been incredibly
beautiful.  Made by a skilled architect, the walkway is constructed of dark
polished wood which has stood the test of abandonment rather well.  The tiers
of cascading flower beds have not had the same luck, and probably began to
descend into wildness and disrepair soon after their maintanace began to wane.
The large treehouse mansion to the north also shows signs of abandonment and
unkemptness.  A feeling of &+rdanger&n fills the air, coming from the north.

&+LEntry hall of &+bBerbrathus Mansion&n~
&n   This grand hall must have once been truly magnificent to behold.  A giant
chandalier, once hanging grandly above, now lies in ruins upon the floor.
Truly strange however, is the fact that little, if any, theft of obviously
valueable items has occurred.  One vase in particular seems to be made of
solid gold, and sits undisturbed on a wooden cabinet.  Side hallways stretch
off to the east and west, while a door to the north leads further into the
mansion.

&n   This is the east wing of the abandoned house.  Strange footprints can be
seen upon the dusty floor, and a putrid smell of decay more stongly fills the
air as the slight ventilation provided by the front doors becomes farther
away.  The end of the wing can be seen just a bit farther to the east, where
a shape can be seen moving to a rhythmic clanking sound.

nearly overpowering here, and what looks like rotted chunks of flesh dot the
floor.  &+rBloodstains&n which look perhaps a hundred years old splash across
the walls as well as the floor here.  A steel hook has been embedded into the
wall here, into which a humanoid figures shackles have been fitted.

&n   The putrid smell of decaying flesh fills the air here, and strange moaning
sounds can be heard.  Although there are no light sources here inside the
mansion, an eerie glow provides just enough light to create shadowy forms from
objects.  Briefly, a strange metallic clanking sound echoes in from the east,
but is very faint.  The wing seems to end just to the west.

&n   This is the only damaged room in the mansion.  Chunks of broken furniture
lie strewn about the floor, and &+rscorch&n marks cover the walls.  A strange
sigil has been burned into the wooden floor, and is encased in a circular
rune.  A few mostly decomposed hacked off body parts lie mixed in with the
destroyed and broken furniture.  Whatever magical ritual took place here seems
to have had rather devastating effects upon the people and objects present at
the time.

lead out toward the entrance hall.  Strangely, the dust and decay which has
plagued the entry halls of the mansion has not imposed itself here.  The walls
and furniture are in a perfect state of repair, and the hall looks immaculate.
Magnificent tapestries hang from the ceiling, depicting scenes thousands of
years old.  To the north, the living room of &+bBerbrathus&n can be seen.

hang upon the walls, and magically glowing globes of crystal hang from the
ceiling.  Glass cabinets house antique artifacts that depect scenes from the
great war, and show not a hint of dust.  A huge cherry wood desk sits on the
far side of the room, behind which &+bBerbrathus&n himself sits.

to the west are made of &+Ysolid gold&n, and are carved with thousands of tiny
suns.  The letters &+YSolos&n have been inscribed in the center of each sun, in
letters so tiny they can only be read close up.  Beyond the gates a very wide
courtyard can be seen, filled with worshippers in sun colored robes.

&+YSteps Before &+Wthe&+Y Inner Sanctum&n~
&n   This set of stone stairs seems to be carved entirely from one single solid
chunk of &+Ysun marble&n.  It radiates a pale golden light, providing the sole
illumination to the room.  To the west, where the &+Yinner sanctum&n is located,
a bright golden light pulsates, making it hard to look in that direction.  The
ceiling here is made of conjoined arches of stone, supported by sun marble
columns.  Tapestries that depect scenes of valor and heroism in the name of
goodness hang obscured by dust as thick as a fingers width.

&+WThe &+YInner Sanctum &+Wof &+YSolos&n~
&n  This is the inner sanctum of the material projection of &+YSolos&n.  The steps
end here, and enter into a room carved entirely from &+Ysun&+Wstone&n in the shape
of a sphere.  In the center of that sphere is a burning ball of fire, which
pulsates and radiates as if trying to communicate.  Only a true visionary of
&+YSolos&n can understand that pulsating language, and there has not been a
visionary here in &+gAravne&n since the evil presence first began affecting
the city.  Perhaps it is this lack of communication which has allowed the
order to descend into its current state of &+Levil&n and &+Lperversion&n.

&+RThe Grand &+CSkyway Climb&n~
&n  Here the wooden skyway makes its final ascent up to the &+cnoble district&n,
where the famed &+Larena of &+gAravne&n is located.  During the afternoon
hours, there is constant traffic on this section of skyway, as citizens and
visitors alike make their way up the ascent to watch the daily festivities.
Just ahead is the guard booth which marks the transition to the &+cnoble district&n
of &+gAravne&n.

&+gGuardhouse of the &+cNobles District&n~
&n   Here the main skyway through aravne intersects with a large guardhouse,
constructed to keep a close eye on the traffic passing between districts.  Two
side paths are completely blocked off here, leading to the homes of the &+cnobles&n
of &+gAravne&n.  Only those who reside there by order of the king are allowed
to travel those paths, and they are guarded by strange magical columns.  To
the north, &+LThe &+rKings&+L Walk&n continues on toward the &+garena&n and the prime tree.

&+LThe &+rKings &+LWalk&n~
&n   This is the most straightforward, well maintained skyway in all of &+gAravne&n.
Bracketed by walls crawling with beautiful flower vines, even the smell is
pleasant here.  Wooden poles topped by glowing globes bracket the skyway every
dozen feet, casting a pleasant illumination on the area.  This high up in the
forest, many of the branches run rampant with green growth, making it next to
impossible to see off of the main path.  This gives this whole stretch of
skyway the impression that it is the sole of existence here, and floats in a
world of &+ggreen&n.  Just ahead to the north, some sort of construction can
be seen on the left side of the walk, perhaps an intersection of some sort.

focal point of much traffic by the commoners, and looks like it leads down
into the &+garena&n.

coated by a very sticky sap, making it nearly impossible to fall.  The thick
wooden steps of the ladder are worn from constant travel, and interwoven with
stong vines to provide extra handholds.

the stands.  Below, the sounds of creatures preparing for battle can be heard,
as well as shouts of encouragement by the trainers.

traffic passes here, other than that of the owners or trainers.  Those who have
become gladiators through slavery or capture never again will pass this way,
as those who die are simply fed to the others or dropped through the trees for
animals to enjoy.

&+gArena &+LStands&n~
&n   This set of stands stretches in a rectangular manner all the way around
the &+garena&n floor below.  Filled with &+rbloodthirsty &+Lspectators&n, the raucus
sounds of the stands echoes throughout the area.  A railing made of thin,
interwoven vines provides visibility, but not accessability, to the fighting
below.  Huge globes of light hang suspended in a random fashion from branches
high above the &+gArena&n, providing a large amount of illumination.

&n   The wooden floor of this walkway has been permanently stained dark by
leaking &+rblood&n.  Scratch marks from bodies being dragged across its surface
etch the otherwise worn smooth floor.  Holding cells bracket the hallway
periodically, inside which gladiators wait for their call to fight.  The
sounds of swearing in several different tounges echo through these halls, and
the faint sounds of fighting can be heard from the arena floor&n.

scattered into a pile on one side of the room to provide bedding.  A hole an
arms width in diamater has been cut into the floor, through which the occupant
is able to relieve themself.  Two thick iron rungs are embedded into the far
wall to accomodate discipline problems.  A wooden sword and shield are also
attached to the far wall via cables, in order to allow the occupant practice
time without endagering the lives of the trainers and cellkeepers.

&n   This side passage is the entrance to the &+gArena&n floor.  To the east,
the sounds of steel crashing into steel can be heard, as well as a brief yell
of pain periodically.  The ground here is scattered by tiny chunks of bark,
dragged in from where it completely covers the arena floor.  Iron rungs are
embedded on both sides of the wall, providing a means of keeping beasts and
gladiators from prematurely beginning their killing spree.

&n   Here is where all of the actual fighting takes place.  The ground is made
up of a two inch thick layer of tiny bark chunks, which soak up blood nicely.
A fifteen foot high wall encircles the entire arena floor, above which lie
stands filled with bloodthirsty spectators.  Two champion gladiators circle
each other here, providing the crowd with its main event.  To the west, a
metal grate provides access back toward the holding cells, where other
gladiators wait for their turn to live or die.

&+LEnd of the &+rKings &+LWalk&n~
&n   Here the kings walk comes to an end at the center of the trunk of the
&+gprime tree&+W of &+gAravne&n.  The walk looks as though it continues into
the inside of the tree, but two gigantic doors conceal whatever lies beyond.
Blood has been spilled here dozens of times by those seeking entrance without
the kings blessing, but entrance has never been acheived by force.  Sigils of
powerful magic cover every square inch of the doors, preventing forced entry.
A depression in the center of the doors looks like some sort of keyhole, with
a sigil shaped object being needed for activation.

&+LThe &+rRoyal &+LCourtyard&n~
&n   This cross shaped courtyard has not been carved within the tree, but has
rather been provided by the tree.  Elven magicians have enchanted the walls
and floor to grow in pleasing shapes and textures, and the result is a
magnificent chamber.  Light seems to radiate from the walls themselves, and
a feeling of magic fills the air.  Paintings and tepestries are enchanted to
hang not all the walls, but in the air next to the walls.  Their images seem
almost to move, and there is one depicting the royal courtyard of every
kingdom in the realm.  Rumor has it that the king and royal wizards use these
images to spy on their rivals somehow.  A wooden statue has grown from the
floor in the center of the courtyard, depecting the current king.  Every time
there is a succession and a new king of aravne takes the throne, the statue
reshapes itself to the image of the new leader through the magic of the tree.

magnificent chamber.  Light seems to radiate from the walls themselves, and
a feeling of magic fills the air.  Paintings and tepestries are enchanted to
hang not all the walls, but in the air next to the walls.  Their images seem
almost to move, and there is one depicting the royal courtyard of every
kingdom in the realm.  Rumor has it that the king and royal wizards use these
images to spy on their rivals somehow.  A wooden statue has grown from the
floor in the center of the courtyard, depecting the current king.  Every time
there is a succession and a new king of aravne takes the throne, the statue
reshapes itself to the image of the new leader through the magic of the tree.

&+LThe &+rRoyal &+LCourtyard&n~
&n   This cross shaped courtyard has not been carved within the tree, but has
rather been provided by the tree.  Elven magicians have enchanted the walls
and floor to grow in pleasing shapes and textures, and the result is a
magnificent chamber.  Light seems to radiate from the walls themselves, and
a feeling of magic fills the air.  Paintings and tepestries are enchanted to
hang not all the walls, but in the air next to the walls.  Their images seem
almost to move, and there is one depicting the royal courtyard of every
kingdom in the realm.  Rumor has it that the king and royal wizards use these
images to spy on their rivals somehow.  A wooden statue has grown from the
floor in the center of the courtyard, depecting the current king.  Every time
there is a succession and a new king of aravne takes the throne, the statue
reshapes itself to the image of the new leader through the magic of the tree.
To the north, the courtyard turns into a wide hallway, beyond which lies the
throne room.

&+LFoyer Before the &+rThrone &+LRoom&n~
&n   South lies the courtyard, while to the north sits the &+rthrone &+Wof&n &+gAravne&n.
The view of the throne room itself is obstructed by a spell of obscuring, and
even the royal guards are not usually allowed to pass beyond.  A huge sigil
glows on the floor, part of the growth of the tree itself, and casts a reddish
light upon the entire chambers.  Occasionally, a rasping sound, like the
speech of demons, wafts in from the north.  A sense of extreme danger fills
this chamber like the weight of a thousand pounds of water.

&+rThrone &+LRoom of &+gAravne&n~
&n   The air in this room sparkles with magical power, focused by the tree into
this chamber.  Glowing and pulsating light radiates not just from the walls,
but also from the air itself.  A giant painting floats behind the throne,
depecting the king during his days of youth.  The throne itself is made of
solid platinum, and inlayed with gold and diamonds.  A human corpse lies in
the center of the room, a sacrificial dagger embedded in its chest.  It lies
on the &+rheart&n of the &+gPrime Tree&n, slowly leaking corrupted blood onto
that very heart.  Stains from previous sacrafices burn into the wood as well,
and looking upon this scene gives an instant answer as to the source of evil
perversion cropping up throughout the forest.  Every living thing inside the
forest is connected to the prime tree, and what affects this tree affects all.
