&+LBefore &+BN&+by'&+BN&+beth's &+LStronghold&n~
&+L   Here the rough edges of this &+munderworld&+L cavern narrow as they stretch
&+Lfarther north, until they are no wider than a large corridor.  To the north,
&+Lthe jagged edges smooth and flatten until they are no more, giving way to an
&+Lartificially formed hallway.  A beautiful archway can be seen to the north in
&+Lthe dim &+Wglow&+L provided by the strange stone walls&n.

&+LArchway Entrance to &+BN&+by'&+BN&+beth's&n~
&+L   Here the smooth walls, hewn from a blend of strange &+munderword&+L stone,
&+Lcome to an end in a beautiful archway.  The archway is formed by two glowing
&+gillithium&+L pillars, coming to a nondescript completion above a wooden door.
&+LWhat is remarkable are the two carvings of &+rdevils&+L, facing forward and
&+Lwrithing in &+rpain&+L and &+ragony&+L from the hooks they hang impaled through
&+Lthe back upon.  The fact that they are moving, suggests that they are some
&+Lof &+BN&+by'&+BN&+beth's&+L dreaded &+ranimations&+L.

&+LA Smooth &+yEarthen&+L Corridor&n~
&+L   The smooth, &+yearthen&+L walls of this east west corridor are completely
&+Ldifferent from the strange glowing stone beyond the archway to the south.
&+LBits of &+yroot&+L stick out from parts of the ceiling and walls, as well
&+Las projecting points of rock.  The corridor looks as though it ends just
&+Lto the west of here.&n

&+LA Smooth &+yEarthen &+LCorridor&n~
&+L   Here the &+yearthen&+L corridor comes to its western end.  There are no
&+Lvisible exits here, making this appear to be the end of the passage.  On the
&+Lnorth wall of the corridor, a strange looking &+yroot&+L protrudes in a very
&+Lsuspicious manner.  Also the air has a slight tinge of subterranian &+ggas&+L.

&+LChamber of the &+rChained &+gWyrm&n~
&+L   While here at the south end this chamber seems no wider than a typical
&+rdungeon&+L corridor, to the north it steadily widens into a giant T shape.  The
&+Lsmell of noxious &+ggas&+L is nearly overpowering here, as the air has little
&+Lmovement here to allow it to disperse and escape.  While what lies to the
&+Least and west of the T shape cannot be seen around the corners, a large
&+ggreen&+L shape is visible against the far north wall, directly in the center.

&+LAltar of the &+rChained &+gWyrm&n~
&+L   A raised stone dias takes up much of the floor here, protruding outwards
&+Lfrom the north wall.  Gigantic iron rings protrude from several places on
&+Lthe north wall, from which dangle &+rchains&+L so large their individual links
&+Lare the size of a man.  The purpose of those chains are to restrain a large,
&+Ladult &+ggreen wyrm&+L, and are effective indeed.  The &+gwyrm&+L appears hungry
&+Lbut healthy, and whatever &+BN&+by'&+BN&+beth's&+L reason was to restrain this beast
&+Lhere, he appears capable of serving that purpose.

&+LIt radiates a sickly &+ggreen&+L light, which makes all living flesh the light
&+Lfalls upon look &+gdiseased&+L or &+gill&+L.  A &+Cshimmering&+L portal floats in
&+Lthe air against the north wall, and two rune inscribed doors lead out to the
&+Least and west.  A magic mouth, looking decayed in the &+ggreen&+L light, floats
&+Lin the center of the chamber, seeming to invade the minds of all present with
&+Lthoughts and words...&n
&+C"So you have braved my simple yet devious entry chamber.  Well that was only
&+Cthe beginning.  I have devided my dungeons into three stages, each of which
&+Cwill offer you no escape once you commit to their completion.  The first
&+Clevel lies beyond this portal, the second lies beyond the east door, and the
&+Cthird lies beyond the west door.  Enter the second or third without the means
&+Cto continue you gained from the previous level, and you will find you have no
&+Cescape, ending up as just another pile of bones left on my dungeon floors.&n

&+Lrandom way they are assorted, has created a plethora of hiding places in,

&+LBeginning of the &+BRiver &+Lof &+RBlood&n~
&+L   Here an underground river is joined by a small stream of brakish water
&+Rpouring through a grate in the eastern wall.  Underneath the grate the river
&+Litself swirls up from a completely submerged tunnel into this passage, which
&+Rit fills more than halfway.  The water itself is a deep, dark red color,
&+Lprobably from being rich in nutrients as it eats away at earthen banks much
&+Rfarther upstream.  To the west, the churning water continues onward down
&+Lthe passage.

&+LEnd of the &+BRiver &+Lof &+RBlood&n~
&+L   Here the bloody river plunges back down into the black depths of the earth.
&+RAs it does so, it makes a slight curve, which during times of higher water
&+Lslowly wore away at the eastern end of the tunnel.  Eventually the rock
&+Rbegan to give way, forming a beach of red sandy stone which allows a landing
&+Lto be made here.  A small crack in the eastern side of the tunnel above the
&+Rbeach like sand leads out onto a wide sandy bank and a new cavern.  Perhaps
&+Lthe savage water once flowed in that direction, creating the smooth sandy
&+Rbeach which extends into the darkness.

&+yEarthen &+LBank of a &+RLava River&n~
&+y   This is a wide beach of smooth stone pebbles, formed of magma rock worn
&+ysmooth over the centuries by the river which once passed here.  Mixed in among
&+rthe small sand pebbles are half melted chunks of magma rock, ejected from
&+rthe lava river which flows past to the south.  To the north, the cavern
&+yends the wide bank in a wall of sedimentairy stone, covered by bumpy rock
&+yformations created by condensing evaporated water rich with minerals.&n

&+LBefore the &+rAudience &+LChamber&n~
&+L   Here the hallway has narrowed down as it approaches the audience room to
&+Lthe east.  Instead of alterna&+Rting pill&+Lars and murals here, the walls are
&+Linstead covered by incred&+Rible&+L enchant&+Red pa&+Lintings.  The paintings themselves
&+Lare so realisting the app&+Rear&+L to &+Rbe&+L mor&+Re li&+Lke portals to other incredible
&+Lworlds than actual painti&+Rngs.&+L  One de&+Rpict&+Ls a world of gigantic trees, while
&+Lanother shows huge chunks of &+Rearth the&+L size of small continents floating
&+Labout in empty space, their top surface covered by forests and grassy plains.
&+LThe floor is laid with strange red and black marbled stone blocks, which
&+Lwhen looked at in an abstract manner the red veins appear to form half of a
&+Lface, its red eye seeming to stare into the room, watching.&n

&+rAudience &+LChamber of &+BN&+by'&+BN&+beth&n~
&+L   This is a gently angled cone s&+Bh&+Laped chamber, its point far above the level
&+Lof the floor.  Every bit of spac&+Be o&+Ln the floor and walls are completely
&+Lcovered with glowing blue runes&+B, cas&+Lting an eerie light into the room.  The
&+Lshape and design of the chambe&+Br was o&+Lbviosly made for a purpose, that being
&+Lthe containment of the dispor&+Bportionat&+Le mind that Ny'Neth has placed inside
&+Lhis golem here.  Focusing on&+B the constr&+Luct itself causes anything peripheral
&+Lto the viewer to blur out o&+Bf existence, &+Land the brain of the viewer to scream
&+Lout in protest at the impo&+Bssible reality &+Lbefore it.  The actual air of the
&+Lchamber seems to shimmer,&+B as though filled&+L with superheated air, even though
&+Lthe temperature remains &+Bcool.  Unless focus&+Led on, the walls of the room begin
&+Lto spin in the mind of &+Bthe viewer, the glowi&+Lng runes blending together to
&+Lform newer and even st&+Branger moving symbols. &+L Physical objects here seem to
&+Lphase in and out of r&+Beality, perhaps passing t&+Lhrough other plains of existence,
&+Las they also protest&+B the impossibility that is &+Lpresented by such a massive
&+Lmind contained with&+Bin the insufficient size of t&+Lhe construct.&n

&+LThe First Vault of &+BN&+by'&+BN&+beth&n~
&+L   This is a small cube shaped chamber, filled with trophy cases, pedestals,
&+Land wall mounted racks, all displaying powerful magical relics.  Although
&+Lthey are on display, there is nothing here to indicate any kind of magical
&+Lguardian or trap.  Apparently the objects contained here are intended to be
&+Lsome kind of reward for any being capable of defeating the construct, as
&+BN&+by'&+BN&+beth &+L is easily powerful enough that not even a lesser god could
&+Lrob him of his possessions without defeating the &+mwizard&+L himself.  What
&+Lrelics lie in his lower vaults can only be speculated on, but if the power
&+Lof the objects here is any indication, they must be highly magical indeed.
&+LGreed is a powerful force indeed, and any who stand here must feel the force
&+Lof that greed burning within them, urgin them to go deeper into the stronghold.
&+LExactly as &+BN&+by'&+BN&+beth&+L intended when he made this vault probably.&n
