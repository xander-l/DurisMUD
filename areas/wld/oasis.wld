&+yEntrance to a Small Village~
   To the east, a small dirt path leads to what appears to be a small fishing
or hunting village.  Crudely constructed huts seem to surround concentric paths
which branch out from the center of the village.  A single large path leads
east to west straight through the center of the small village.  Sharpened wood
stakes have been bound together with simple rope to form a defensive wall to
protect against invaders.  Four large wooden towers have been constructed at
the corners of the hamlet to provide advanced warning of incoming ships.

&+yApproaching a Large Double Gate~
   Ahead, a large dominating wooden gate has been constructed to prevent entry
to any who would be a threat to the oasis village.  The gravel here has many
track marks from caravans that must, undoubtedly, be used to transport goods
between the docks and the village.  This small island cannot possibly provide
for the needs of this village alone, so hunters often have to leave in search
of food and supplies on some of the larger islands in the area.

&+yBefore the Gates of the &+CO&+Gasi&+Cs &+yVillage~
   The gates which stand here, tower to well over twenty feet high.  The
gates, which have been constructed from the trunks of mature trees from local
islands, are incredibly thick and heavy.  An intricate pully system has been
put in place to operate the large gate.  The people of this village may not be
as primitive as once thought.  Lookout slits have been cut into the heavy gate
to allow for the villagers to speak with outsiders who visit the island.  The
village gates have been opened ahead of time.  Either the village doesn't view
the party as a threat, or someone must wish to talk.  The village must not
get many visitors here, because the guards maintaining the gate eye strangers
with caution and disdain.

&+yInside the Village~
   To the west, the imposing gates of the oasis village stand ajar.  Guards
stand ready to operate the pully system to close the gates if the lookout
towers signal that a potential enemy may be approaching.  Women and children
wander about the village maintaining their daily activities.  They do,
however, occasionally glance at around with curiosity.  To the east, one of the
circular paths intersects the main road of the village.

&+yA Path Intersection~
   Here, the main road of the village is intercepted by a smaller gravel path
which leads around the village to the north and south.  This outer path runs
parallel to the spiked wooden fence, and leads to the four large guard towers
which are found at the corners of the village.  This, the largest of the paths,
doesn't have much activity on it.  The most activity can be found nearer to the
center of the village, which lies to the east.

&+yOn a Circular Path Around the Island Village~
   This is the largest and most distant path around the village.  Apart from
lizards and encroaching shrubbery, this path is rather plain.  Every once in
a while, a guard patrol will pass by keeping the peace.  The most imposing
guard of this village is the tall wooden wall which keeps the village safe from
invaders.  Strong wooden stakes were sharpened and then driven deep into the
ground, before being bound by rope.  There are very few cracks between the
stakes which leaves the guard towers as the only way to see out from the
village.

   This path has been worn over many decades of use.  This is the main artery
which connects the village commerce district from the docks which are found
west of the large gates on the shore.  Footprints and wagon grooves alike have
worn their way into the dirt.  To the east, the residential path can be seen,
and to the west, the large path which surrounds the village is found.  Further
away towards the east, a well built home dominates the center of the village.

   Two small cots have been prepared against the north wall for the guards to
sleep on.  There are four guards posted at each of the guard towers at all
times.  Two of the guards are stationed above watching over the island and the
seas for any signs of invaders.  Two of the guards are allowed to sleep here
on the cots beneath the tower.  Guard shifts last for eight hours, and after a
shift is completed the guards may choose to sleep or visit their families in
the village.  At no time are any of the towers left unguarded.  The lookout
tower is above, and can be reached via a simple ladder which leads through a
trapdoor.

first sign of trouble, a large metal bell can be rung to signal the village
to be alert.  The gate guards immediately shut the massive wooden gates, and
the village prepares for a siege.  Fortunately, this village is well prepared
to deal with most foreign threats from the harsh world of Duris.

&+bIn a Small House~
   Although, the houses in this village are rather simple in design, their
craftsmanship is superb.  This sturdy house has been made with some of the
finest wood available.  A small but intracately carved staircase winds up to
the second floor of the abode, where a large bedroom can be found.  This room
serves as the living room, kitchen and dining room for the inhabitants of the
house.  Well made furniture has been placed carefully to create a cozy feel
to the house.

with their newly acquired wares.  This area can certainly be described as

   This armory has been made of some very strong wood, likely from one of
the neighboring forest covered islands.  A small selection of armors have been
imported and some have been forged here from foreign metals.  Bargor and his
assistant seem to have a flair for the art of making armor, and have made
some of the most sought after pieces in the world.  Here, Bargor's assistant
attends to the customers, while Bargor pounds away on his anvil in the
underground forge.

Immense heat gushes forth from the large stone firepit.  A simple stone
staircase leads up to the showing room of the armory, where Bargor displays
some of his fine pieces of armor.  Bargor can often be found here pounding
on large slabs of iron which he acquires from all over the lands.

broadswords and tridents.  The shopekeeper is a well known explorer and
collector of fine weapons.  It is rumored that Jallev once had the legendary
sword &+L'Avernus' the Lifestealer&n in his collection before a travelling barbarian
made him an offer he couldn't refuse.  Jallev has also been known to forge
some of his own weapons, and he is quite proficient at doing so.  Jallev's
assistant sells his wares while Jallev toils in his workshop.

   Up ahead a relatively large abode which serves as the home of the mayor of
this village is seen.  The mayor has been put in charge with many of the day
to day plannings of the village.  All the villagers look up to this man, and
think of him as a blessing to the small outcropping.  A well crafted oak door
stands between the elements and the mayors house to the east.

one.  A beautiful painting of the mayor standing with two of his closes friends
Jallev and Bargor, dominate the area above the fireplace in the southern wall.
A beautiful ebonwood staircase leads to the den and bedroom of the mayor, and
a sturdy oak door leads back outside to the west.

the mayor organizes supply runs, and organizes activities for the many
villagers which look to him for guidance.  A gorgeous desk made from pine,
sits against the east wall, and usually accomodates the mayor when he makes
his plans for the village.  This room, due to the size of the house, is also
the mayor's bedroom.  A simple bed sits against the north wall of the room,
and the ebonwood staircase leads down to the living room.

furniture has been places sparsely in this house.  It is likely barren so not
to detract from the many wall decorations.  A cot, much like in a guards
barracks has been put in the northwest corner of the room.

lizards and encroaching shrubbery, this path is rather plain.  Every once in
a while, a guard patrol will pass by keeping the peace.  The most imposing
guard of this village is the tall wooden wall which keeps the village safe from
invaders.  Strong wooden stakes were sharpened and then driven deep into the
ground, before being bound by rope.  There are very few cracks between the
stakes which leaves the guard towers as the only way to see out from the

ground, before being bound by rope.  There are very few cracks between the
stakes which leaves the guard towers as the only way to see out from the
village.

&+yInside a &+LGuard &+yTower~
   Two small cots have been prepared against the north wall for the guards to
sleep on.  There are four guards posted at each of the guard towers at all
times.  Two of the guards are stationed above watching over the island and the
seas for any signs of invaders.  Two of the guards are allowed to sleep here
on the cots beneath the tower.  Guard shifts last for eight hours, and after a
shift is completed the guards may choose to sleep or visit their families in
the village.  At no time are any of the towers left unguarded.  The lookout
tower is above, and can be reached via a simple ladder which leads through a
trapdoor.

&+yStanding atop a &+LWatch Tower~
   From this vantage, the entire village can be seen.  More importantly, the
oceans which surround this small island, can also be viewed with ease.  At
first sign of trouble, a large metal bell can be rung to signal the village
to be alert.  The gate guards immediately shut the massive wooden gates, and
the village prepares for a siege.  Fortunately, this village is well prepared
to deal with most foreign threats from the harsh world of Duris.

&+mIn a Small Living Room~
   This small living room is decorated similarly to the other houses in the
village.  The villagers seem to be quite adept at making furniture and have
no problems with sharing their wealth with others.  This house is particularly
cozy, and warm due to a firecase which burns brightly in the corner.  A simple
wooden ladder leads up to what seems like a loft above.

   four small beds have been arranged at one side of this short loft, while
a much large bed has been set on the other side.  The 4 small beds must be
the resting places of children, because no full grown humanoid could possibly
get a comfortable nights rest in one.

&+yThe Home of a Small Humanoid~
   This small house has been designed with a smaller inhabitant in mind.  All
of the furniture is about half the size of the furniture in the other houses,
suggesting that the occupant is of gnomish or halfling descent.  A comfortable,
yet very small leather chair has been set in the southeast corner of the room
facing the door.  The faint smell of incense burns here, giving the abode a
cozy feel.

&+bIn a Small House~
   Although, the houses in this village are rather simple in design, their
craftsmanship is superb.  This sturdy house has been made with some of the
finest wood available.  A small but intracately carved staircase winds up to
the second floor of the abode, where a large bedroom can be found.  This room
serves as the living room, kitchen and dining room for the inhabitants of the
house.  Well made furniture has been placed carefully to create a cozy feel
to the house.

room, adding a bit of sophistication to the quaint obode.  A well crafted
staircase leads down to the living room from here.

&+yEntrance &+Lto the &+WDiamond &+LMines~
   This natural mine is likely the reason for establishing this village, and
also the reason for such a strong defensive wall.  &+WDiamonds &nwere discovered
in this cave many years ago, and soon after the village was built around it.
For as long as anyone can remember, the oasis villagers have dug into the mine
to find the diamonds which are used for bartering with neighboring continents
and even for such items as spears used for hunting fish and wild animals on
the nearby islands.

&+LThe Warrior's Tower~
   This tall tower has been built here to train the fledgling warriors of the
oasis village.  The tower is also open to any outsiders who wish to come to the
tower and train under some of the finest warriors in the land.  The loud clang
of metal meeting metal reverberates off the polished dark stone walls.  The
door to the tower is found to the northeast.  A steep winding staircase, which
circles the walls of the tower, leads to the upper floors of the tower.  The
training room is to the west.

level.  Also, on each level, one of the fabled oasis gladiators waits to
challenge his next opponent.  The gladiators on each floor of the tower become
increasingly adept in battle, and must be defeated to claim the key to ascend
to the next level.  A &+ggreen &ndoor awaits those who can defeat the guardian
of this tower floor.

all areas of this large stone room sparring with all manner of weapons, some of
which include swords, flails, halberds, and axes.  Padded boards and fencing
dummies also hang from the ceilings for the fighters to practice with.  The
strong stench of perspiration seems to push these warriors to fight even harder

tunnels are rather large, allowing for many full sized humanoids to proceed
through in groups.  Strange looking footprints have been left in the dirt here
suggesting recent activity.  Some tattered clothing has also been left on the
ground here.  The clothing seems to be marred with blood.  The tunnel can be
cleared away above, to return to the surface.  The tunnel also leads to
the north, into darkness.

&+GA Spawning Nexus~
&+g   This room seems to be a nest of sorts.  From this point, many of the insect
&+gcreatures are hatched by a large mantis female.  This room is heavily cushioned
&+gwith the putrid flourescent green slime which covers the caverns.  The slime
&+gseems to be mildly acidic, but perhaps it is nutritious for the insects, which
&+gseem to relish in the disgusting fluid.  The only exit from this nest, is up
&+gto the spawning grounds.

   This crack is a small nest of sorts, but not for mantis.  It appears to be
a hatching ground for locusts.  Maybe the two insect races are related in some
way.  The walls of this room are also covered with the vile acidic goo that
is found elsewhere in the caverns.  The crevice is wide enough to allow access
back to the tunnels to the southwest.  There are no other exits from this room.

&+LEntrance to a Large &+WSkull-Decorated &+LHall~
   This section of the lair seems to be very heavily guarded.  Many tough
mantis patrol here.  Whatever lies ahead must be very important to the insect
beasts.  The darkness here makes seeing ahead quite difficult.  The chittering
noise of many mantis fill the hallway.  The well guarded hallway continues to
the south, and to the north it opens up into a large hall of sorts.

&+LA Large &+WSkull-Decorated &+LHall~
   Strangely enough, this large hall appears to be a staging ground for raids.
The mantis have decorated the hall with the remains of their victims.  Skulls
of all shapes and sizes decorate the walls.  Inspection of some of the remains
indicate that some are perhaps hundreds of years old.  It is hard to imagine
that the insects possess the intelligence to design raiding patterns or even
the desire to display their kills.  This is a strange race of beings indeed.

here, defiantly.  The wall is impenetrable, and all attempts to pass through
it, are met with futility.  A glowing image of the mantis royaly has been
emblazoned on the wall to the south.  Only the most honored of the mantis
tribes are allowed access to the lair of the mantis royalty.

&+gThe &+LLair &+gof the &+YQueen~
   This grand chamber is a few stories tall, and it has to be, to accomodate
the frame of the queen of the mantis species.  The females of the mantis are
much, much larger than the male variety and much more rare.  This chamber
houses the queen of the mantis.  It is sparsely decorated, as one would imagine
from a primitive race of insectoid humanoids.  An enormous cloth map of the
entire world of Duris has been draped over the western wall.  Some of the
more populated towns of the region have been marked.  It seems strange that a
map would find itself in the lair of beasts which do not have the means to
create it.

the gateway to another dimension.  Whatever created this room is definitely
not of the mantis species.  Perhaps the queen of the mantis is merely a puppet
under the control of an alien race?  The portal which rests here, suggests a
far more sinister entity is behind the recent attacks upon the island oasis.

&+Lof the beautiful &+Wdiamonds&+L which make the village a hotbed of activity in

&+LBefore a Large &+yNatural&+L Cave~
&+L   Up ahead lies a large natural cavern that was discovered when the miners
&+Lwere excavating the newest tunnels of the &+Wdiamond&+L mine.  The cavern may have
&+Lkept a powerful entity from freedom for aeons.  The unwitting miners likely
&+Lreleased the beast when they tunneled into the tomb recently.  It seems that
&+Lthe beast has the power to raise and command the dead, and much care should
&+Lbe taken before attempting to return it to &+rhell&+L.

&+LA Massive &+yNatural &+LCavern~
   This large cavern is covered in diamonds.  Many of them are larger than most
people can even imagine.  The natural cavern extends upwards about fifty feet,
and is about ninety feet in diameter.  A legend speaks of a demon who was so
evil, he was imprisoned in an earthen tomb by his master, the God of the under
world.  The demon's ruthlessness was incredible, and few people dared speak his
name.  He was instead referred to as the Ambassador of Hell.  It was rumored
that his power was so great, that his magical influence could be felt beyond
stone walls, and he was able to charm his victims from afar.  Many of the
ambassador's victims were known to chant his name while under his control.

&+bA Large Tomb~
   The God of the underworld imprisoned his protege here after he recognized
the threat that his underling was trying to take over his realms.  This magical
tomb had sealed the ambassador demon for centuries, but a chance excavation
released his power once again.  This tomb is rather plain except for the
magical glyphs which were put here to keep the demon encased in this chamber.
The only exit from this foreboding tomb is south to a large cavern.
