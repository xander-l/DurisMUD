&+YA Small Broken Down Shack&n~
&+y   This small shack has seen better days, missing beams sealing let in a breeze
&+yfrom the outside, the wooden floor is covered with dirt and small weeds grow
&+ythrough the cracks in the wood, a small window to the south has sharp shards
&+yof glass sticking out from the frame.  There is many potions and vials resting
&+yhaphazardly on a wooden bench.  A small broken down shelf rest against the wall
&+yto the north.  There is a wooden door hanging by one hinge to the east.&n

&+rThe Bloody Plains&n~
   This is obviously the site of a ancient battle of epic proportions.  There
are the skeletal remains from hundreds of humanoid bodies in various stages
of decomposition littering the area here.  The devastation is mind boggling,
large craters big enough to swallow small groups of unwary travelers are
scattered throughout the surrounding area, no signs of plant or animal life can
be seen anyplace and huge boulders seem to have been melted down or blown to
bits.  There is a thick fog blanketing the plains with a eerie silvery mist
making it difficult to see far in any direction.

&+rThe Bloody Plains&n~
   This is obviously the site of a ancient battle of epic proportions.  There
are the skeletal remains from hundreds of humanoid bodies in various stages
of decomposition littering the area here.  The devastation is mind boggling,
large craters big enough to swallow small groups of unwary travelers are
scattered throughout the surrounding area, no signs of plant or animal life can
be seen anyplace and huge boulders seem to have been melted down or blown to
bits.  There is a thick fog blanketing the plains with a eerie silvery mist
making it difficult to see far in any direction.

&+rThe Bloody Plains&n~
   This is obviously the site of a ancient battle of epic proportions.  There
are the skeletal remains from hundreds of humanoid bodies in various stages
of decomposition littering the area here.  The devastation is mind boggling,
large craters big enough to swallow small groups of unwary travelers are
scattered throughout the surrounding area, no signs of plant or animal life can
be seen anyplace and huge boulders seem to have been melted down or blown to
bits.  There is a thick fog blanketing the plains with a eerie silvery mist
making it difficult to see far in any direction.

&+rThe Bloody Plains&n~
   This is obviously the site of a ancient battle of epic proportions.  There
are the skeletal remains from hundreds of humanoid bodies in various stages
of decomposition littering the area here.  The devastation is mind boggling,
large craters big enough to swallow small groups of unwary travelers are
scattered throughout the surrounding area, no signs of plant or animal life can
be seen anyplace and huge boulders seem to have been melted down or blown to
bits.  There is a thick fog blanketing the plains with a eerie silvery mist

&+L   A well kept road made of massive stones placed side by side, connected in
&+Lbetween by huge wooden beams, meets a ancient road made what appears to be
&+Lblack marble slabs.  Barking dogs and other strange noises can be heard
&+Lcomming from he surrounding area.  The well kept road trails off west and

&+rThe Bloody Plains&n~
   This is obviously the site of a ancient battle of epic proportions.  There
are the skeletal remains from hundreds of humanoid bodies in various stages
of decomposition littering the area here.  The devastation is mind boggling,
large craters big enough to swallow small groups of unwary travelers are
scattered throughout the surrounding area, no signs of plant or animal life can
be seen anyplace and huge boulders seem to have been melted down or blown to
bits.  There is a thick fog blanketing the plains with a eerie silvery mist
making it difficult to see far in any direction.

Road Across the Bloody Plains~
   This old road seems to be well kept, no debris of any kind can be seen.  It
appears to be made of massive stones placed side by side, connected in between
by huge wooden beams.  The bloody plans surround the road on each side
stretching off into thick blanket of fog.  The road leads away to the north
and south.

&+rThe Bloody Plains&n~
   This is obviously the site of a ancient battle of epic proportions.  There
are the skeletal remains from hundreds of humanoid bodies in various stages
of decomposition littering the area here.  The devastation is mind boggling,
large craters big enough to swallow small groups of unwary travelers are
scattered throughout the surrounding area, no signs of plant or animal life can
be seen anyplace and huge boulders seem to have been melted down or blown to
bits.  There is a thick fog blanketing the plains with a eerie silvery mist
making it difficult to see far in any direction.
