   &+LThe rope bridge here connects two peaks of this mountain pass
&+Lthat are separated by a small ravine.  The ravine below looks
&+Lsimply like a rocky drop, but is just cause enough for one to
&+Lhave built this bridge.  One of the more larger races of Duris
&+Lmust have created this bridge, as it is sturdy enough for quite a

&+LWithin a &+mSpider-Filled&n &+LCave&n~
   This cavern is full of spiders, some of them quite
big.  It is a dark and cool cavern, with many little
tunnels that lead elsewhere into the mountains.  Spider
webs have been spun almost everywhere, making travel
very sticky.  These spiders are large enough to trap
small animals that wander in here.

&+LCave of the Roc&n~
    This cave is a huge area deep in the Roc Talon
Mountains where a huge roc is said live.  The floor of
the cave is scattered with bones, most of them humanoid.
There are old feathers, at least six feet in length,
lying around and there is an odd odor in the air.

   The black gate is an enormous obsidian gate that
was erected long ago as part of the outer rim of
Shady Grove defense forces.  Long ago a battle
raged on in these lands where the good and evil fought,
and eventually the undead of the fallen enemies.  This
gate was once the last line of defense.  Now, it is home
to just a large skeleton of an orc gate guard who still
follows his duty.

&+mA Mining Tunnel Entrance in the Mountains&N~
   This mining tunnel is dug in a fashion known by the
duergars and dwarf-kin, judging by the size, shape, and
angle it has been dug.  An old mining tunnel extends to
the east into the darkness under the mountain, while a
rolling hillside with a grassy plain can be seen to the
west.  This tunnel carries with it no lanterns or any
signs of equipment at this juncture.

    This tunnel was dug out long ago by miners.  It
appears to have been dug from the bottom up, meaning
it was most likely the work of duergar miners looking
to get to the surface.  The area is pitch-black and
running water can be heard.  The walls of the tunnel
are smooth and wet to the touch, with little fungi
growing in different spots.

    This natural cavern is filled with mushrooms.
There are multiple paths in the cavern, most of them
heading in a north-south direction.  The mushrooms
vary in size from the very small mushrooms that are
squashed when you step on them, to the huge mushrooms
as tall as a human.

&+yA Narrow Pass Before a Grove&N~
   &+yThis narrow pass in the mountains reaches towards
&+ya narrow grove of trees, hidden in the mountains.
&+yThis narrow pass seems comfortably only hold one
&+yindividual at a time.  The walls of this ravine seem
&+yto reach very high and block one's vision from the
&+yspacious overlook previously experienced.  There
&+yis a lush grove located to the east.

&+yA Rocky Mountain Trail&N~
   &+yThis rocky mountain trail winds through these
&+ylush and fertile peaks.  The clouds are thick and
&+ythe ocean is clearly visable towards the west and
&+ysouth from this point.  There are many different
&+ycritters in this fertile mountain path.

&+gA Small &+GGrove&+g of Trees&N~
   &+gThis small grove &+yhigh in the mountains&+g seems to be
&+gof some sort of variation of the exquisite elven tree, the
&+gdark moor.  These mountainous trees, however, have far fewer
&+gleaves then the dark moors, but seem to be much taller and
&+gthicker.  This grove of trees seems quite pleasant in the
&+gjagged rocky mountain trail and seems to be quite the
&+gsanctuary.

   &+gA large circle of stones has been carefully placed
&+gin this corner of the grove.  These druidic stones seem
&+gto glow and fluctuate with the wind in this mountainous
&+gterrain.  The stones are arranged in a perfect circle
&+gfacing a smaller circle of stones in the center.  The

&+gsized humanoid to comfortably sit, meditate, and commune

&+BA Tavern in the &+GInn of the &+YBeech &+Gand &+cEucalyptus~
   &+cThis grand inn of &+YShaledrieth&+c is maintained by the
&+chighly-respected and lively grey elves of Charing.  Although
&+conly simple cousins, the high elves and grey elves of this
&+crealm both have one common enemy, the races of the underworld
&+cwho try tirelessly to invade, plague, and destroy their
&+cpeaceful and lush lands.  The Inn of the &+YBeech &+cand the
&+cEucalyptus does not see many high elves, as they are mostly a
&+cguardian race of the great sun well.  Adventurers of numerous
&+cother surface races frequent this fine inn.

&+YA Pillared &+WFoyer&+Y Before the Larethian Sunwell&N~
   &+YThis great foyer has numerous pillars stretching out eastward
&+Yin a continuation of this great shrine to Lareth, King of
&+YJustice.  The great dragon king and his court of golden
&+Ydragon followers are immortalized in this shrine through
&+Ythe carvings and utterly perfect sculptings on the columns
&+Ysupporting this megalistic structure.  Each column, reaching
&+Ywell over one hundred feet high, stands perfectly unique
&+Yand unscathed.  The great and legendary Larethian sunwell
&+Yblazes to the east, illuminating the shrine and captivating
&+Ythe worshipers residing here.

&+YA Heavily &+WGuarded &+YPost Before the Golden Stairs~
   &+YProtected from the evil and tyranny of the realm, this guard
&+Ypost serves as fortified line of defense before the great
&+Ygolden stairs to the east.  This guard post was most likely
&+Yadded to the shrine in the past several hundred years, rather
&+Ythan being included in its original design.  Imagery of the
&+YKing of Justice, Lareth, and his court of golden dragons can
&+Ybe seen in the brickwork as well as the columns supporting
&+Ythis megalithic structure.

   &+YTwo massive golden pillars in the shape of the great dragon
&+YLareth, King of Justice stand here offering portal to the
&+Yshrine east of here.  The harsh mountain climb to the west
&+Yseems wonderfully insignifigant in comparison to the megalistic
&+Ystructure.  Created in an ancient time by the draconian followers
&+Yof Lareth himself, this shrine has been since inhabited by human
&+Yfollowers, as well as high elves seeking Justice and balance.

   The twisting pass through the peaks of Lareth climbs up to this
gloriously heavenly golden Shrine in clear view east of here.
Built upon the highest peaks of Lareth, the shrine seems to tower
over the continent, casting an incredible view across the seas
and the realm.

   This narrow passage winds up several directions into the mountains.
This ground, however, is not as untraversable as the rest of the
neighboring terrain, hinting to the theory that it may have been worked
by people to create such a passage.  However, in its subtleness, the
passage seems natural enough, almost as if the rock has contoured to
the whim of a higher power.

   The black gate is clearly visible to the south. It is an enormous obsidian
gate that was erected long ago as part of the outer rim of the Shady Grove
defense forces. Although the gate has fallen into disrepair since it was
built, it is still serves as an important road block against the troll armies
of the South.

&+y   This tunnel leads directly beneath the tall mountains
&+yof the Great Divide. The walls are damp with water which
&+yhas seeped through small cracks. Quite a bit of moss grows

   &+cThis large, domed chamber rests high in the mountain peaks of

&+csee the other side of the great moonwell in the port of Fenaline.

&+coutpost under the protection of the high elves.  Four huge columns
&+cstand in the corners of this peak dias, each carved into various
&+chigh elven prophets and figures of great lore.  A grand foyer
&+clies to the south followed by a large staircase downward into
&+cthe outpost of Shaledrieth.
