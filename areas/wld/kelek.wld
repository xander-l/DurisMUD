&+LThe Top of a Mining Shaft~
&+L   This large cave houses various mechanical contraptions that were obviously
&+Lused when this was an active mine.  The main mining shaft sinks into the
&+Ldarkness in the middle of the cave.  Large wooden beams lie next to the
&+Lopening, forming some sort of bracing structure for the shaft itself.  A
&+Lrotting stench wafts from the shaft.

&+LShaft Into the &+CMithril&+L Mines&n~
&+L   The mining shaft descends into the darkness.  Veins of unmined mithril are
&+Lreadily visible on the sides of the shaft.  The stench worsens towards the
&+Lbottom, and giant spiderwebs hang from the walls.  The walls are scarred from
&+Lthe mighty dwarven hammers and chisels that carved out the shaft.

&+LBottom of the Shaft Into the &+CMithril&+L Mines&n~
&+L   The shaft bottoms out here in a pile of rotting corpses and bones.  This
&+Lwould appear to be the source of the overpowering stench.  The darkness here
&+Lseems to swallow everything, and appears to have some sort of unnatural source.
&+LBroken weaponry and armor is scattered on the floor, amongst chunks of mined
&+Lmithril.

&+Lbanished here long ago, and spent the long years here in tormented agony
&+Luntil the Dwarven Invasion broke the seals surrounding his lair.  Once he
&+Lregained his freedom, he quickly took advantage of the chaos to ensure his
&+Lvictory over both Duergar and Mountain Dwarf.  The evidence of his new and
&+Lcruel reign is readily seen throughout the mines.
