&+LDirt &+yPath&N~
   &+yThis dirt road slowly turns into a gravel road as it nears a large
&+ywalled &+WFortress &+ydirectly to the east. This ground seems very well
&+ytraveled. Many footprints of medium size and horse hooves are scattered
&+yacross the ground below. There is a valiant looking structure to the east.

The &+YGolden Gates&N of a &+WFortress&N~
   &+WWhitestone &Nwalls block out all visable entry to this fortress except
&Nfor the only gate sitting at what seems to be the front of this hall. The
&Ngate is made completely out of solid &+Ygold&N. It seems to illuminate in
&Nthe day, or even the night. A very lustrous tint gleams from the polished
&Nhinges of the gate, which never seem to rust or bare any imperfections.

&+Lflows from wall-to-wall in the entire lengths of the floor of the hallways.
&+LThe walls themselves inside the hallway are made of pure &+Wwhitestone
&+Land each block is flawlessly cut. The inhabitants of this palace live very

&+Wsit each with four chairs scattered about the middle of this room. There
&+Wis an open fireplace ablaze with &+rflame&+W. On the western wall in the

&+Wbottles of liquor. There sits eight stools in front of the bar that are
&+Wmounted to the stone floor. Three bright white orbs float in the air near
&+Wthe ceiling of the room, each following a path of small circles. A branch
&+Wof directions leads off from this particular room to the west and east.
&+WThe corridor leading off west is the inn's guest sleeping chambers, and

&+cotherwise in this stone chamber. A large red velvet rug covers the floor

&+Loccasion in this room. This room is about three times the size of the
&+Lappointment chamber north of here, blocked off only by a mere velvet
&+Lcurtain. There is a curtained window lined with blocks of whitestones
&+Lon the northern wall, with about fifteen feet of floor between it and the
&+Llarge bed. A large armoir stands tall next to a storage chest taking up
&+Lthe entire west wall. There is a mirror and a rack of armor and clothing

&+Lhis own secret shop. It was hidden very carefully and must have taken awhile
&+Lto decorate this room. As crowded as his normal chamber is, this one is MUCH
&+Lmore. Piles of growing ferns and still-bubbling potions sit on top of
&+Leachother. This room emits a very strange scent, almost earthly and watery.

&+cno tapestries or torches mounted to the walls, for they would surely
&+cblow away. This portion of the hall is lit by means of natural light, also
&+ccoming from the north. There is also no carpet in this portion of the

&+WThere is no ceiling to this room, a large chimney juts up to the top of the

&+LCenter of the Settlement&N~
   &+LThis portion of the tunnels through the humid caverns serves as the
&+Lcenter of the kuo-toan settlement.  South of this point a windy tunnel
&+Lcurls through the underdark back towards the cavern floor whereat the
&+Lshallow pool lies. Up from this point is some sort of holy kuo-toan
&+Laltar.  Both east and west of here a long, narrow tunnel leads off
&+Linto the darkness.

&+LThe Steps Before an &+GAltar&N~
   &+LA huge set of steps is here, carved completely out of the cavern floor
&+Litself.  This portion of the cave must have been on an upward steady slant
&+Ljudging by the almost near perfection of the steps themselves. The
&+Latmosphere is very humid, and the ground below is slippery with a thin
&+Lcoat of slime.  Further upward on these steps a low chant can be heard.

&+LAn &+GAltar &+Lto &+gBlipdoolpoolpoo~
   &+LThis towering altar made of bone of rocks bound with snakeskin seems
&+Lto glow with power.  Around the altar is a small pool, filled with
&+Lkuo-toan kneeling water's in which they'd pray in.  This portion of the
&+Lcavern is mere feet from the cavern ceiling. Stalagtites from above are
&+Ljust barely out of reach from the average kuo-toan head.  This altar is
&+Lwhere the kuo-toa gather their spiritual strength daily, to their
&+LGod, Blipoodoopoo.

&+Lcan be heard echoing from the north, as an obvious sign of life.  From this

&+Lof the distance traveled further into the earth.

   &+LThis tunnel is right before the leader's cave, directly north of here.
&+LThis position is guarded just as heavily as the gates to the entire
