&+LA &+cLavish &+LHome&n~
   &+cThis home is lavishly decorated with expensive but useless trinkets from
&+cvarious parts of the world. It is very obvious that the &+Wnobles &+cin this
&+cdistrict pride themselves with being able to spend money on unnecessary
&+citems, simply because they can. The floor is made from &+Lblack &+ypine&+c, and
&+cthe walls are covered with &+Wsilk tapestries&+c. Even the roof is painted with
&+Ygold &+yleaf&+c, adding ever more to the posh and stuffy atmosphere that more

&+LThe &+WGrand &+LIntersection of &+yMerchant's Way &+Land the &+WPrancing &+yFawn&n~
   &+wThis intersection sits squarely at the &+rheart &+wof this great city, and with
&+wgood reason. The main avenues of travel, the &+WPrancing &+yFawn &+wand &+yMerchant's
&+yWay&+w, collide into this square with a &+Wflurry &+wof &+Wactivity&+w. These two massive
&+wroads are eased into one another through the use of an extremely large
&+Lroundabout&+w. The traffic of thousands of visitors and citizens flows in a
&+wcircle, delivering &+Wproduce &+wand &+Wgoods &nfrom far away lands to the hands of
&+wshopkeepers and their customers in the city's fabled &+CCe&+cle&+Cs&+cti&+Cal &+WBa&+wza&+War&+w. A
&+wmassive statue of flowing &+Bblue&n-&+Ggreen &+Bwater &+wstands at the center, suspended
&+win its current shape by the &+Lmagical &+wchants of numerous &+Wwhite-clad Monks&+w.
&+wTo the &+LEast&+w, &+LNorth &+wand &+LSouth&+w, the massives roads lead to the city's main
&+Lgates&+w. To the &+LWest&+w, the enormous &+CCe&+cle&+Cs&+cti&+Cal &+WBa&+wza&+War&+w makes a grand appearance.&n

&+wAs this is a gathering spot for many citizen's of the world, it is not unusual
&+wto see groups of adventurer's meeting up and leaving from this &+Yheralded location&+w.
&+WBenevolent &+wspellcasters often pass through the area looking to bestow some

&+Llarge &+ybronze &+Lstatue of a mighty &+Ygriffon &+Lstands impressively to your left.
&+LA very attractive &+Creceptionist &+Lsits behind an oak desk to your right, ready
&+Lto help adventures make their way to one of the many comfortable beds this
&+Lestablishment rents on a regular basis. The atmosphere is &+rwarm &+Land &+rcozy&+L,
&+Lenticing you to kick off your boots and sit down for a nice cup of &+yale &+Lor
&+Lif you are the brave type, a glass of &+wthroat&+Rf&+ri&+Rr&+re&+L, the house specialty. A
&+Lcrackling &+rfire&+Lplace sits towards the back of the room, surrounded by tables
&+Lfilled with thirsty patrons and tired travelers. To the &+wEast&+L, is the fabled
&+CCe&+cle&+Cs&+cti&+Cal &+WBa&+wza&+War&+L, the main market place of &+WWinterhaven&+L. To the &+wWest&+L, is a

&+LThe &+rCozy &+LCorner of the &+yBronze &+YGriffon&n~
   &+LThis room sits comfortably at the back of this building. The walls and
&+Lfloor are made from &+ymahogany &+Las dark as &+ymolasses&+L. The floors crack under
&+Lyour footsteps as you make your way through the room. The atmosphere is
&+Lquiet, even though the stage is prepared for the various musicians of
&+Lthe day to entertain the tavern's many customers. The barmaids are busy
&+Lfulfilling the patrons &+wevery &+Lcommand, as wretched as they may be. You
&+Lnotice a &+Cpainting&+L, apparently a work in progress, proped up in the corner
&+Lto your right. An oddly placed &+ybookcase &+Lsits against the &+wNorthern &+Lwall.
&+LTo the &+wEast&+L, is the main room of the &+yBronze &+YGriffon &+yTavern &+Land &+yInn.&n

&+wthe plain &+Lgray cobblestone &+wroad. As one would expect, the attire in this

&+wleather &+wtrousers and a well-worn shirt that used to be &+Wwhite&+w. Although one
&+wwill occasionally see a marginally &+cwealthy &+wmerchant in this area, the most

&+LOn a Road, North of &+WWinterhaven&n~
&+g   This road is built very delicately into the surrounding forest.
&+gThe workers were obviously instructed to build the road around the
&+gtrees, keeping the large and majestic &+yoaks &+galive. This road itself
&+gis made of a &+Ldark &+gdecomposed &+Lobisidian&+g. The &+Lblack stone &+gmakes the air
&+gfeel warmer than it is as it reflects the heat from the &+ysun &+gtowards
&+gthe many traveling merchants.&n

&+CFoundry &+Lof the Iron &+YHammer&n~
&+L   This room is really quite large and seems to have
&+Lbeen designed to allow dozens of artisans and metal
&+Lworkers to gather around a central furnace. The floors
&+Land walls are all made of a heat resistant obsidian
&+Lflagstone. The roof is very tall and has center shaft
&+Lthat climbs skyward, providing excellent ventilation
&+Lfor the sulfurous fumes that constantly billow out
&+Lfrom the furnace. There are also a large number of
&+Lanvils that are seemingly unoccupied. This place
&+Lis definitely the perfect place for someone who is
&+Llooking to tinker around and &+rforge &+wnew equipment&+L.&n

&+LAlon&+wg a G&+Lrav&+we&+Ll Hi&+wgh&+Lway&n~
&+g   This road is one of the major highays that lead to the city of
&+WWinterhaven&+g. To the &+LNorth &+gand &+LSouth &+gyou can see the King's Forest,
&+gthe private woodlands of the royal family. To the &+LWest &+gyou can see
&+gthe massive gates that protect Winterhaven from intruders, and to
&+gthe &+LEast&+g, you can see &nIbaron's Pass &+gleading to the twin mountains
&+gof &+YTuz'l Banzik the &+WSavior&+g. The weather is very pleasant and even
&+gthough there may be well over one hundred merchants, nobles and
&+gcommoners that share the streets with you, it is remarkably placid
&+gand quiet. The ground is paved in a &+ybrown cobblestone &+gand looks to
&+gbe well maintained. As you look towards the city, you see the many
&+gtowers that stand tall in the sky, each adorned with large flags.

&+LAlon&+wg a G&+Lrav&+we&+Ll Hi&+wgh&+Lway&n~
&+g   This road is one of the major highays that lead to the city of
&+WWinterhaven&+g. To the &+LNorth &+gand &+LSouth &+gyou can see the King's Forest,
&+gthe private woodlands of the royal family. To the &+LWest &+gyou can see
&+gthe massive gates that protect Winterhaven from intruders, and to
&+gthe &+LEast&+g, you can see &nIbaron's Pass &+gleading to the twin mountains
&+gof &+YTuz'l Banzik the &+WSavior&+g. The weather is very pleasant and even
&+gthough there may be well over one hundred merchants, nobles and
&+gcommoners that share the streets with you, it is remarkably placid
&+gand quiet. The ground is paved in a &+ybrown cobblestone &+gand looks to
&+gbe well maintained. As you look towards the city, you see the many
&+gtowers that stand tall in the sky, each adorned with large flags.

&+L   Filled with drunks and scallywags, this dark room is the place of choice for

&+Lof the room. Twenty or more rowdy men are busy drinking and chatting with the
&+Lpretty barmaids. The air is filled with the smell of stale ale, sweat, and salt.
&+LStrangely, there is a very large ship anchor sitting in the middle of the room.&n

&+rand trinkets lie inside a display case. The room doesn't have any windows
&+ror torches to keep the room illuminated. Instead, the walls, ceiling and
&+Reven the floors of the room seem to glow a pale white, providing just
&+Renough light so customers can see.&n

&+ythe room, with a large ventilation duct running from the back to the front
&+yof the building. Apprently &+WRosenthal &+ydiscovered that by sending the bakery

&+CThat's probab&+Wly because the &+Cpainting wasn't&+W a painting, bu&+Ct a doorway int&+Wo
&+Cthis snowy&+W world. The tre&+Ces are fantasti&+Wcally blanketed&+C by a thick lay&+Wer of
