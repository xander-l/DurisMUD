&+rEdge of Herd Island&n~
   A steep chasm marks off this edge of a vast island in the
cavern-city of Ixarkon.  A long barrier of piled rocks a few feet
high encircles the island's periphery to prevent any of the
islands vast herds of rothes from falling off the island down to
the dark chasm below.  Slaves of numerous races watch over the
herds as the rothes nibble on some odd, twisted fungus and some
grayish kind of grain plant.  A few illithids flit about the
island, controlling the plantation's slaves.  The island
continues to the east.

cavern-city of Ixarkon to the north and west.  A long barrier of
piled rocks a few feet high encircles the island's periphery to
prevent any of the islands vast herdes of rothes from falling off

illithids control the slaves with no more than a thought,
casually directing them in their tasks.  The illithids occasionally
glance over at a stone building to the east.

&+rHerd Island&n~
   Slaves of innumerable Underdark races watch over vast herds of
rothes that graze on the island.  This immense island on the
outskirts of the illithid city of Ixarkon supplies the city with
its source of food; although whether the docile rothes or the
mesmerized slaves are that food depends on the tastes and means
of the individual illithid.  A small stone barrier runs along the
south edge of the island here, just before a sheer chasm.  The
island continues in all other directions.

&+LAn awful stench pervades the squalid lair; the slaves are covered
&+Lwith layers of grime and filth and what looks like a few dead
&+Lbodies lie decomposing in a corner.  A narrow trough runs along
&+Lone wall, occasionally an illithid will come in and fill the
&+Ltrough with some dreary looking gruel.  A sturdy iron door leads
&+Lout of the slave pens to the west.

&+yA Cavernous Meeting Room in the Rockspire&n~
   This cavernous room is hundreds of feet across and gives the
impression that it was literally hollowed out of the mountain.
The room lies draped in a black, inky darkness that appears
bright as day to the numerous illithid elders and nobles whose
presence fills the room.  A large stone meeting table sits neatly
in the center of the room; a few illithids deign to sit at it,
but most prefer to pace about the room.  A sharp, briny stench
pervades the air which literally thrums with the mental power of
the gathered illithids and their elder brain.  A narrow pathway
marked on either side by large stalagmites leads north from the
room; the foyer of the Rockspire is to the south.

&+yA Narrow Pathway Bordered by Large Stalagmites&n~
   Large stalagmites of varying heights, some as large as twenty
feet, space themselves evenly on either side of a narrow pathway.
The regular spacing of the stalagmites seems wholly unnatural, as
if it violates some fundamental order.  A sharp, briny stench
fills the air and seems to waft in from a dark entrance in the
room's wall above.  The northern end of the pathway melds
perfectly with an ancient stone stairway that rises into the air
toward the source of the stench.  A cavernous meeting room full
of illithid elders is to the south.

&+yA Stone Chamber Deep Within the Rockspire&n~
   A large stone chamber has been hollowed out of the stone high
up in the Rockspire.  The roughly square chamber is ringed by a
narrow stone catwalk that surrounds a large, hollowed out
depression whose sides are lined with some strange metal.  The
hollow is filled with a briny fluid whose aroma fills the air and
assaults the senses.  Within the brine is the elder brain of
Ixarkon, a sentient amalgam of brain matter which oversees most
of the functions of the city.  A few young illithid tadpoles can
be seen swimming about in the brine.  An ancient stone stairway
leads down from the chamber; the narrow catwalk leads east and
west around the elder brain. A series of short steps leads up to
a platform atop the elder brain.

ceiling of the immense room is nearly fifty feet above; large
stone pillars set throughout the room stabilize the temple.  The
temple is surprisingly bare and does not appear well attended,

observance of some unknown ritual.  A large stone platform

priest of Maanzencorian, a relatively thankless task due to the
greater reverence shown to Ilsensine.  The walls of the small
chamber are lined with seemingly hundreds of books, many in
languages long considered dead.  The high priest of Maanzencorian
has kept his chambers relatively simple; apart from the book-
lined shelves the only other furnishings are a small desk and a
small basin for him to rest in.  A small stone door leads out to

&+MA Large Amphitheater Dedicated to Ilsensine&n~
   An immense, circular room has been hollowed out of the very
bowels of the earth by the powerful magics of the illithids of
Ixarkon.  The upper part of the room is arranged into long rows
of benches upon which many of the illithids can sit. Despite the
large crowd waiting to get into the amphitheatre outside, the
whole city could probably fit into the amphitheater with room to
spare.  Along the upper portion of the walls can be seen numerous
bas-reliefs of the deity Ilsensine, Creator of the Illithid race
and the object of many of their devotions. A long carpeted
pathway splits the room in two, and leads down to a rounded
clearing from which the high priest conducts the days ceremonies.

for this enormous amphitheater, which in reality, is the site of
worship for the illithids greatest god, Ilsensine. A long red
carpet splits the rows of benches neatly, and comes to an end at
the lip of the gravelly circle.  The circle is completely
unadorned; the illithid inside has no altars or vestments with
which he conducts his ceremonies.  To any not of their race, the
rituals are simply incomprehensible.  The back end of the
clearing is not the rock wall of the amphitheater oddly; the rock
itself seems to have dissolved into a multitudinous array of
colors. A few illithids sitting in the amphitheater's benches
occasionally stand, walk down the red carpet, and simply fade
into the veil of color.

   Appearing as if a thin oil slick, a shifting veil of colors
shifts and fades across the wall where once only rock existed. A
faint underlying pattern can be seen in the shapes and images the
colors briefly form as a few illithids walk into the veil and
simply disappear.  A subconscious urge, a longing to enter within
the veil takes over the limbs of any who come too close; for this
is the work of Ilsensine, and here in this domain he cannot be
resisted.  The only exit is to enter the veil, and to see where
the pattern of color dictates emergence.  Only a few chosen ones
of Ilsensine can resist the pull, and leave to the east.

furnishings and carefully placed trinkets.  In one corner of the

cavern.  The dwelling lies a few feet below the ground level, and
is somewhat small.  Despite its small size, the dwelling is
elegantly furnished; apparently the owner is some kind of rich
merchant.  Lush carpeting and twisted bizarre works of art
decorate the tiny dwelling.  A large stone basin roughly six feet
long rests in the far corner of the room; it is filled with a
purplish black slime that exudes a foul stench.  The doorway
leads east out to a broad cavern.

&+LA Broad Cavern Honeycombed With Dwellings&n~
&+y   The land rises and falls in irregular patterns in this broad
&+yexpanse of cavern.  The twisted bumps and bends of the cavern
&+yhide innumerable doorways hollowed out into the solid ground of
&+ythe cavern, home to many of the city's illithids of moderate
&+ymeans.  A great towering spire of rock dominates the eastern
&+yportion of the cavern, rising up hundreds of feet into the vast
&+ydarkness above.  The doorway to one dwelling is directly to the
&+yeast; the cavern continues to the west.

&+mA Lavish Dwelling Bored Into The Spire&n~
   A rather large dwelling has been bored out of the rock of the
towering central spire of Ixarkon.  The floor is covered with
thousand of tiny ceramic tiles, many bearing intricate designs.
Other ostentatious signs of wealth are many small gold statuettes
placed in various locations about the domicile.  A great black
lacquered basin occupies one edge of the of the dwelling;
apparently the illithids like to rest in the basins of slime.
Arched stone doorways lead out of the dwelling both to the north
and west.

   A large room several dozens of feet in length has been
hollowed out of the cavern wall.  Large niches lead off from the
main body of the room; in each niche appears to be a large metal
basin within which a few illithids can be seen resting.  A well-
dressed illithid stands off to one side near the rooms entrance
and gives a slight nod to the occasional customer.  This appears
to be a place where illithids away from their homes can come for
some rest.  The room's wide doorway leads out to a broad cavern
to the north.

   A heavily worn trail runs up to the outskirts of the bustling
markets of Ixarkon. Numerous illithids of all manner and station
frequent the markets in search of goods to buy, or simply to
watch many of the impromptu slave fights.  Mingled among the many
illithids are slaves of all sorts, some being led here to be
sold, others simply acting as porters to their masters. A trail
heads west to the slave plantations; the market and its outskirts
are to the east and north respectively.

walking through here are being led to the auction block for sale
by their masters. From this vantage point an excellent view of
the commanding Rockspire can be seen; the immense stone ziggurat
houses the Elder Brain of Ixarkon and is the seat of the
communities leadership.  The markets are to the east; a trail
winds through the outskirts to the south.

merchants stalls choosing between elegant robes and numerous
small trinkets.  Many slaves of all races mix among their
illithid masters, many no doubt being led for sale to the auction
blocks nearby.  A few hulking brain golems wander throughout the
district making sure that order is kept throughout the city.  The
markets continue to the east and south.  As compared to other
cities in the underworld, Ixarkon is a rather quiet city, the
communication amid the throng of illithid taking place
psionically.

leads slaves off to the great auction blocks at the center of the
great markets, where virtually any type of being the illithids
have enslaved can be bought for a price.  A few of the merchants
sell embroidered robes and fancily woven clothing, others sell
trinkets or works of art for the illithids to display in their
homes.  The markets continue to the north, east and south; the
throng peters out to the west.

   Illithid commoners and wealthy merchants comingle in the
sprawling bazaar that is the market of Ixarkon.  Exotic wares
captured in far off raids sell alongside more mundane goods such
as food and clothing.  Nearly as numerous in the markets as the
illithids are slaves from nearly every race imaginable; a few
drow and ogre slaves can be seen being led through the crowd not
to mention the more common goblin slaves.  More terrifying than
the powerful illithids, massive brain golems police the markets
ensuring that nothing goes amiss.  These brute constructs of the
illithid's are extremely powerful, and as a consequence nothing
much ever goes wrong in Ixarkon.  To the north and east the
sprawling markets continue; west and south the crowd dies down a
bit.

fortress of the cities elders, home of the Elder Brain.  Rising
directly to the south is another spire of rock, honeycombed with
numerous dwellings, a few windows of which can be seen in the

   A modest stall has been set up to the north of the bustling
markets of Ixarkon.  The spacious wooden structure is relatively
sparse but for one feature: the dozens of large and small cages
that fill the stall up to the ceiling.  Each cage is stuffed with
many animals of all sorts.  A large peg staked in the middle of
the stall holds the chains of numerous rothes who have been tied
up here.  A few scrawny goblins are also attached to the peg, but
they look a little sickly and weak.  Apparently the illithid
merchant of this stall makes a living selling food to the poorer
illithids of the city, as the wealthy prefer to snack on somewhat
more dignified food such as drow brains ala carte.  The markets
of the city are to the south.

   The gathering throng of illithids concentrates around the
large stone platform set in the middle of the great market
district of the city. Slaves of innumerable races are led up a
short series of steps atop the platform, and silently bid on by
the surrounding throng.  A few of the slaves are then led off by
their new owners, whether for hard labor or a light snack is
unknown.  The few slaves that aren't bid on are either led back
to the city's plantations or sold to some of the city's food
merchants in private auctions.  The markets of the city surround
the auction block in all directions; to the north a crowd of
illithids seem to be wagering on a contest of some sorts.

   A wide cavern flows over with abundant commercial activity in
the middle of the widespread settlement of Ixarkon. Illithids
from all parts of the city converge in this central cavern to
trade and barter among the merchants stalls and to participate in
the great slave auctions held in the center of the markets to the
north.  Slaves of all races mingle with their illithid masters,
some being led to the blocks, some being led off to provide work
or food for their new masters.  At the northern end of the
markets a great ziggurat dominates the city; the Rockspire is the
home of the settlement's Elder Brain and the meeting place for
the city's elders and the few illithid priests.  The crowd thins
a bit to the south; the market continues in all directions.

   A narrow dusty trail breaks off from the northern edge of the
bustling market district of Ixarkon and heads northward.  The
trail lies in the shadow of the massive Rockspire, a tremendous
stone ziggurat which houses the Elder Brain of the city as well
as many other important inhabitants such as the high priest of
Ilsensine.  The trail seems relatively well-used; the few
illithid travelers seem to be ones of higher rank in the city.
Occasionally a brain golem lumbers out of the Rockspire to watch
over the illithid's domain in the caverns below. The trail
scrambles upward here toward the front gate of the Rockspire, and
southward lie the markets of the city.

&+yA Narrow Trail Around&+L The Great Spire&n~
   A narrow dirt trail winds its way around the base of the great
towering central spire of rock in Ixarkon.  The windows of many
dwellings can be seen high up in the spire but there are no
visible way to get to them.  The spire's base is hundreds of
feet across, and the spire seems to stretch hundreds of feet up
into the air.  This narrow trail closely follows the base the
spire and is used by many of the inhabitants of Ixarkon to travel
around the spire; many use it to reach the bustling markets of
the city from their homes.  The trail continues to the north and
west here; a view of the markets to the north can barely be made
out.

   A relatively small hollow serves as a home for one of the
poorer members of the illithid society. Unable to purchase homes
in the classier sections of town, or unable to muster the slaves
to build it for them, these illithids have been forced to live in
dirty hovels on the edge of town.  A few shoddy trinkets adorn
the small structure but overall the home is very threadbare.  A
narrow depression in the stone floor is filled with a gooey
slime, and serves as a bed for the poor illithid.  The hovel's

to the wealthy denizens of the city who pass by from the classier
areas of town to the east, they sell primarily gaudy trinkets and
clothing of all sorts.  The bustling markets of the city are to

&+yA Tight, Narrow Canyon&n~
   The canyon walls taper down quickly as the cavern ceiling high
above plunges down.  The canyon here seems little more than a
wide tunnel through the rock, strewn with dust and dirt.  About
ten feet across, the canyon here is surprisingly damp, with the
soft dirt of the ground threatining to turn to a muddy morass
with any more precipitation.  The canyon heads up and broadens
greatly up above; to the east the canyon bores through the cavern
walls.

&+yA Bore Through The Cavern Wall~
   The long broad canyon that snakes its way across the caverns
of Ixarkon has tapered greatly to a single great crack in the
cavern walls only about five feet in diameter.  A musty odor
fills the damp, humid air; the ground all about feels damp and
spongy.  A faint glow can be seen on the other side of the crack,
which heads downward at a sharp angle.  The canyon heads back to
the west, toward the settlement of the illithids.

&+yA Large Rock Pile&n~
&+G   A pile of strewn boulders and rocks collects under a large
&+Gopening in the cavern wall here.  The tear in the wall is about
&+Gten feet off the ground, and can be reached by scrambling up the
&+Gnearby boulders.  A deep greenish glow reflects off the stony
&+Gsurface of the rocks, emenating from the cavern which stretches
&+Gto the east and south.  Tendrils of white fungal matter snake
&+Gthrough the rock, slowly reducing it to a fine dirt; the air here
&+Gis particularly dry and humid and smells of mushrooms.

&+mA Great Mushroom Forest~
&+G   Sprouting from the damp moist ground are an endless array of
&+Gmushrooms.  Some great specimens stand nearly ten feet tall, with
&+Gspores visible underneath the size of oranges.  The immense
&+Gcavern housing this underground forest glows a soft green glow,
&+Gwhich emenates from a particular species of fungi spread rampant
&+Gthroughout the caverns.  The humid air seems thick and heavy, and
&+Gprovides an idle environment for the mushrooms to thrive.  The
&+Ggreat forest spreads to the north, east, and south here.

&+Gfrom some underground source of water which is not visible amid

&+bthe ceaseless trickle of water down the walls over the centuries.
&+bA small stream of water flows down the walls of the cavern here;
&+bthe source of the water is lost up in the dark reaches of the
&+bcavern's ceiling.  A few fish swish around in the water here,
&+bshedding an eerie luminescent glow.  The cavern continues back to
&+bthe west.
