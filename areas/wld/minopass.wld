&+Lhanging from all different directions, as well as thick

&+WA Massive D&Nome&+Wd Prayer Chamber&N~
   &+WThis massive chamber, just off of the main hallway through this
&+Wtitan fortress, extends westward into a huge domed prayer area.
&+WAs everything in this vicinity is titan-sized, it is no surprise
&+Wthat the pillows on the floor and the altar at the western end of
&+Wthis hall are all utterly massive to an average-sized individual.

   &+WA great &+Ysoothing&+W sensation is felt coming from the altar that
&+Wseems to rejuvenate those in its proximity.

&+LA Strange &+mRuned Door&+L In a Tunnel~
   &+LThis large hallway-like tunnel extends to a massive and very ancient
&+Ldoor covered in elaborate and magical &+mrunes&+L.  The door is hinged and
&+Lstill in tact, but gives a very loud creek when it is touched.  There is a huge
&+Lkeyhole in the door, suggesting that at one point it was meant to be locked.
&+LHowever, the tests of time have proven quite catastrophic for the door, and so
&+Lhave the rogues and lockpickers of this realm.
