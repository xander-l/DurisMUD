&+LA &+yPaved &+cStone &+LRoad&n~
   Flat, wide stones have been cobbled into place to form a very smooth
and well worn road. Spanning nearly thirty five feet wide, this road
continues to the west and in the distance can be seen to curve to the
south. Long sweeping grass seems to sway gently with the wind.

   In shock contrast to the rest of the road, the stone here is covered
in dried blood. Large sections of grass running along the road have been
trampled into the dirt and lie caked with blood. Piles of debris and
broken equipment lie scattered across the wide stone road.

   Dried blood splatteres the well worn stone everywhere. Large scortch
marks seem to mar the ground everywhere you look. The remains of several
massive war machines lies scattered about the area. The remains of a
feeble attempt to build a wooden wall lies broken and burnt.

&+LNearing the &+WGates &+Lof &+bPort S&+Bk&+Cy&+Wt&+Ch&+Bi&+bc&n~
   Nearing the gates, which are still a little to the south, you come
into a wide flat expanse which at one time held several merchant stalls
that would greet travelers coming to the city with some of the best
silks, foods and drinks in the area. Now all thats left is the burnt
out husks of the stalls. A large pitched battle seems to have taken
place here. Pools of dried blood seem to have gathered where bodies
were once piled. Smears of dirt and blood hint that the bodies were
recently draged away.

   Standing between the large stone walls of the port city, the wood and
steel front gate seems to have been torn apart by an unnatural force.
Shards of the shattered gates lie all about the area, as if some sort
of magical explosion slamed into the otherwise sturdy gates. Wicked
scortch marks marr the stone on the walls and road way leading towards
the merchants row.

&+LA Ravaged &+yStone &+LBridge&n~
   Standing on the edge of this stone bridge, the massive destruction
that has been brought to bear is preventing passage on much of the
walkway. To the north, rubble blocks the entire northern half of
the bridge. The only access is to wind your way through the rubble
and broken sections of the bridge to the west.

   Winding your way through the rabble, access to the western end of
the bridge is blocked. Piles of blasted stone lay in heaps all around.
To the north, a path through the rubble has been cleared while back to
the east you can return to the outer gates of the port city.

&+LA Ravaged &+yStone &+LBridge&n~
   Nearing the north western end of the ancient stone bridge, the second inner
gates of the port city can be seen to the west. The destruction to the bridge
actually looks to have been caused by weapons from the inner gates, maybe
in an attempt to slow the attackers advance on the city. Piles of rubble have
been moved to open a path around some of the larger stone obstructions.

   After leaving the massive stone bridge to the east, this wide flat
expanse opens up to reveal the second inner gates of the port city.
Large stone walls stretch to the north and south and house a heavy
steel and iron gateway, fortified again by another heavy wooden door.
Large towers stand on each side of the gate, providing space for
archers and spell casters to call down havok on the seiging forces.
All about the area the signs of a vicious battle can be seen. Dried
blood marks the area, as well as scortched and burnt equipment.
The absence of bodies shows that the seige has been over for some
time.

&+LThe Ruins of the &+yKings &+gWalkway&n~
   The Kings Walkway was once a wide and very smooth road that lead from
the eastern gates into the main bulk of the city. Paved with some stones
brought in from the Bloodstone mountains, this roads resistance to wear
and tear was put to the test during the invasion. Rubble from nearby
buildings clutter the streets, but the stones themselves still seem
in remarkably good condition. The road travels to the north and south
and used to allow access to number of stores and taverns.

   At this point along the Kings Walkway, a tremendous amount of burnt
rubble litters the street. To the west, the remains of a burnt out
tavern lie, utterly gutted. Scattered around the this section of road
lie various tables, chairs and broken casks. Pillaged for everything
it was worth, the remains of the taverns sign hang as a silent marker
for a once busy establishment.
