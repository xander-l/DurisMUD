&=LBA Pocket of Lightning&n~
&+B   The elemental plane of water here is much warmer than the surrounding areas.
&+BThere is a large pocket of lightning resembling a huge sphere of bright light
&+Bfloating in space here. The lightning does not seem to be coming from anything
&+Bin particular, but instead resembles a small chunk of the Para-Elemental Plane
&+Bof Lightning, that somehow found its way here.  The sphere of energy seems to
&+Bbe totally encased in its own pocket of water, and some mystical and unseen
&+Bfield prevents passage within its range.&n

&+BA Jet Stream~
&+B   The currents of the water plane combine here to form a massive column of
&+Bquickly moving water.  The jet itself comprises a fifty to seventy foot
&+Bdiameter column that appears nearly solid as it wooshes through the otherwise
&+Bslothful water around it. Large bubbles of gas escape from the jet periodically
&+Band drift off towards an unknown fate.  Though the passage of the water makes
&+Bsome noise, it is subdued and seems to not disturb the active beings that call
&+Bthis plane home.&n
