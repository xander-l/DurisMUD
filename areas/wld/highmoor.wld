&+gOn a &+LForlorn&+g Passage Among the &+GTrees~
&+g   This narrow passage &+Ldarkens&+g quite suddenly due to the large overgrowth
&+gof branches overhead, the canopy of leaves keeping out both &+Ysun&+g and &+Wmoon&+g.
&+yWhite ash&+g and&+y beeches&+g line the frail path, the trunks providing homes to
&+gmany a creature, as do the rotting logs.  The hammering of woodpeckers
&+gmingles with the sweet singing of &+Bbluebirds&+g.  The ground plants are
&+gprimarily tindril grass, with occasional softwood ferns, hard as a leather
&+gshoe, mingled in amongst.  To the south is a more traveled path, and this
&+gfrail passage continues through the &+Ldarker&+g woods to the north.

&+gOn a &+LDark, Forlorn&+g Passage Among the &+GTrees~
&+g   Suddenly a vast forest seems to come alive as if from nowhere.  In the
&+gvicinity grow hemlock, spruce, birch, oak, pine, palm, and cornock trees.
&+yWhite ash&+g and&+y beeches&+g line the frail path, the trunks providing homes to
&+gmany a creature, as do the rotting logs.  The mellow bickering of a &+Rred robin&n
&+gprovides comfort in the deathly queiet environment.  The ground plants are
&+gprimarily tindril grass, with occasional softwood ferns, hard as a leather

&+gThe &+BBlue&+Gleaf&+g Tree&n~
&+g   Standing in the center of this frail and narrow passage is a most truely
&+gbeautiful &+Bblue&+Gleaf&+g tree.  This tree takes the shape of a large maple,
&+gits leaves radiating a &+bfaint blue&+g light.  The processed leaves are said
&+gto produce a rich blue dye, and when burned, the wood generates immense &+Bblue&n
&+Rflames&+g.  It is rumored that this tree is where &+YGold&+yrym&+g first fell deeply
&+gin love with nature, and it was soon after that the horrible &+Levil&+g that plagues
&+gthe deeper &+CHigh &+MMoor&+g had begun.  To the west can be seen a frail passage

&+gA Widening Passage Among the &+GTrees&n~
&+g   Although the forest path widens quite considerably here, it seems to
&+gcome to a complete stop in front of an amusing hut built of thick &+ybark&+g.
&+gThe canopy formed overhead by the intertwined myriad of trees branches
&+glocks out any possibility of &+Ydaylight&+g, in fact it is impossible to determine
&+gthe time of day in these realms.  Heavy plant life prevents movement to the

&+g   The wide forest passage comes to a complete end here, the thick grasses

&+gtrees here seem to have been molded by magics to intertwine with the sides
&+gof the hut to prevent any deeper passage into the &+CHigh &+MMoor&+g.  The sound of
&+gmoving water grows slightly louder here, however the thick vegetations does
&+gnot allow for any indication as to where the source of water lies.  To the

&+c   Through the flowing waters, a &+Wsparkle&+c can be seen here and there from the

&+csweep down from the tree cover above to frolic about the foamy tidepools, and
&+can &+geel&+c or two can sometimes be seen rising to the surface to feed on the
&+cmany insects that inhabit these woods.  The running waters continue to the

&+YA Barren Clearing After the &+bSerpent's&+L Bridge&n~
&+W   Towering &+gtrees&+W surround the barren patch of dirt on both the east and

&+Wis very hard, and extremely dry, evident by the hairline cracks branching in

&+GLost&+g in the &+CHigh&+M Moor&+g Forest&n~
&+g   In this patch of forest thrive &+Rrose&+gneedle pines.  These trees resemble
&+gminiature evergreens, seldom exceeding three feet in height.  A &+Rrose&+g-like
&+gblossom, usually &+Mpink&+g or &+Wwhite&+g, sprouts from the end of each tiny needle.
&+gAlso foxberries, resembling &+Ybright yellow&+g grapes, grow on snakey vines found

&+gBefore the &+bGrove of &+rSad&+Lness&n~
&+g   This narrow opening among the trees is quite a welcomed relief, and it
&+gseems one can rest peacefully here.  A chuichu tree grows near a lonely
&+glooking well, the plant only being about three feet tall.  The tree produces
&+gcone-shaped &+Yyellow&+g berries that disolve in water to make a delicious,
&+rcinamon-flavored&+g beverage.  Maybe the liquid from the well can make a
&+gsoothing drink.  To the north begins the &+bgrove of &+rsad&+Lness&+g, a most nerve-
&+gwracking place so the rumors say, where creatures that once frolicked freely
&+gin nature now walk among the trees in a manner not meant for nature.&n

&+g   In this patch of forest thrive &+Rrose&+gneedle pines.  These trees resemble
&+gminiature evergreens, seldom exceeding three feet in height.  A &+Rrose&+g-like
&+gblossom, usually &+Mpink&+g or &+Wwhite&+g, sprouts from the end of each tiny needle.
&+gAlso foxberries, resembling &+Ybright yellow&+g grapes, grow on snakey vines found
&+gthroughout the midwood, typically near &+ybeach&+g trees.  Foxberries are greasy to
&+gthe touch and smell like cooked steak.  A continual &+wgray mist&+g permeates much

&+gthe dense underbrush makes travel slightly tougher than elsewhere.  The waist-

&+c   The river is &+bclear&+c and &+bcold&+c.  At times the waters narrow to where one could
&+cbarely soak their feet, while at other times there seems to be no bottom.  At
&+cmost points, the fish are so thick that a raccoon could cross the river by
&+csimply walking on their backs.  In fact some fish here are larger than small
&+cponies, the carp even bigger.  They've been known to chew up &+Ycanoes&+c and pick
&+ctheir teeth with the &+yoars&+c.  The river continues to the south and west.  To the
&+cnorth, a strange swirling of water can be heard, then the sound seems to
&+cdisappear into nothingness.  The current here seems to be flowing to the north.

&+L   This room looks as though it has not changed in over half a century.  Not

&+La great aura of &+Yma&+Ggi&+Rca&+Bl e&+Mne&+Crg&+Wy&+L prevail here, and any attempt to touch some of
&+Lthe chamber's materials will result in a grave, sharp pain.  It seems as though
&+LDr. Fester or those he has worked for decided to preserve this room for a
&+Lday when the necessary powers will exist to allow the morbid scientific
&+Lresearch to continue.  Out of all the items in this chamber, the one that
&+Lis most intriguing is a portrait of a &+Wyoung man&+L on the western wall.  For
&+Lsome strange reason, some of the facial features seem to have been drawn
&+Lover with those of certain beasts of the &+gwilderness&+L, and &+rbeyond&+L.  It must
&+Lhave been the act of some revengeful prankster, even a disgruntled servant,
&+Lto be sure.  The servant's quarters can be reached by exiting to the south.&n

&+gthat looks like a beetle's shell.  Clusters of spindly, leafless branches
&+gcrown the otherwise smooth trunks.  The wood contains &+woily&+g deposits that
&+gmake it exceptionaly &+Rfl&+Yama&+Rble&+g.  It burns nearly three times as long as other
&+gtypes of wood, and produces only half the amound of smoke.  Creepy noises seem
&+gto be emenating from all directions, confusing one's senses.  The forest
&+gcontinues in all directions.&n

&+yAt the Base of an Eastern &+YG&+yate &+YT&+yower&n~
&+y   The &+rfire&+y here illuminates a gate of great girth and powerful strength to
&+ythe west, built of logs from the mightiest of &+CHigh &+MMoor&+y oaks, and yet by the
&+Lscorched&+y patches all over the structure, it becomes quite clear there is no
&+yburning one's way inside.  This small patch of land that has been liberated
&+yfrom the nearby encroachment of &+gtrees&+y houses a tower that seems to shake here
&+yand there, and there is no determining if the wind of something else is the
&+yculprit.  A ladder leads up into the guard tower, while to the east, the mighty
&+yHigh Moor forest can be seen.&n

&+WOn the &+BSerpentine River&n~
&+c   The river is &+bclear&+c and &+bcold&+c.  At times the waters narrow to where one could
&+cbarely soak their feet, while at other times there seems to be no bottom.  At
&+cmost points, the fish are so thick that a raccoon could cross the river by
&+csimply walking on their backs.  In fact some fish here are larger than small
&+cponies, the carp even bigger.  They've been known to chew up &+Ycanoes&+c and pick
&+ctheir teeth with the &+yoars&+c.  The river continues to the west and south.  To the

&+cponies, the carp even bigger.  They've been known to chew up &+Ycanoes&+c and pick
&+ctheir teeth with the &+yoars&+c.  The river continues to the north and south.  To the

&+cdisappear into nothingness.  The current here seems to be flowing to the east.

&+rBefore the &+LFabled&+r Guild of the &+WIk&+R-&+BNah&+r Bandits~
&+r   Rumors have existed for generations that a closely-knit band of bandits
&+rhave dwelled under the forests of the &+CHigh &+MMoor&+r, and that their guild hall
&+rwas a place of great treasures and wealth.  It is also rumored that these
&+rbandits are so brash and bold as to actually have stolen a live &+Wdragon egg&n
&+rfrom &+LSkurge&+r, one of the most feared &+Lblack dragons&+r in all of &+RWyrm&+GWood&+r.  Of
&+rcourse a dragon egg probably commands quite a high ransom, if not unenviable
&+rwrath.  There is a large rock face to the north, and an empty chamber to the

&+greveals that they are pine with &+rred&+g leaf&+Yhopper&+g &+Wlarvae&+g, hanging from the

&+CA Predators &+YNest&n~
&+C   A round, circular room dug into the soft &+Ysand&+C, this chamber is a nest
&+Cthat the boring beetle colony sets up especially for predators that have no
&+Ctaste for the &+ybeetles&+C themselves.  The predators in turn help defend against
&+Cintruders.  The chamber empties into a passageway above.&n

&+C   This passageway has been freshly dug into the soft &+Ysoils&+C of the rich &+gforest&n
&+Cearth.  The boring beetles are so adept at quickly digging tunnel complexes
&+Cthat they do not often stay for very long in one location.  The constant moving
&+Chelps keep too many predators from ever learning of the lair's location.  The
&+Cfast construction of these passages however gives one the uneasy feeling that
&+Cthey can collapse in on themselves at any moment.  The passage continues to
&+Cthe south.  On the floor, a piece of &+gvegetation&+C is seemingly growing out
&+Cfrom solid earth, with no &+Ysunlight&+C to feed it.&n

&+CA &+WFortified&+C Chamber Within the &+yBoring Beetle&+C Lair&n~
&+C   Unlike the other passages and chambers withing this lair, this room has
&+Cbeen fortified with large &+ybranches&+C and the thick &+Wexoskeletons&+C of dead &+yboring
&+ybeetles&+C.  This is so that there are no unnecassary cave-ins here, which
&+Cmeans that there is some reason this area is considrered important.  Nothing
&+Chere seems out of the norm save for a &+Lrockpile&+C againstthe southern wall
&+Cand the drag marks on the floor near the pile.  A dark passageway can be seen
&+Cabove.&n

&+CA &+LSmelly&+C Room Filled with &+gRotting Vegetation&n~
&+C   The &+Lsmell&+C alone in here would be enough to normally bring a person
&+Cto their knees.  Piles of &+grotting vegetation&+C litter the area, and must be
&+Csaved by the lair inhabitants as a backup food source.  Some of the organic
&+Cmaterial in here almost seems to take a life of its own, being here for so
&+Clong.  In fact, from the &+yfecal&+C matter in the room, one becomes quite
&+Cconvinced of this fact.&n

&+CThe &+BQueen's&+C Chambers&n~
&+C   This room has no trace of soil or dirt, but rather the whole room is coated
&+Cwith &+ybranches &+Cand &+ytwigs&+C, almost looking like the inside of a primitive hut.
&+CThere are no furnishings of any type to be seen, in fact the entire room is
&+Cbarren except for the thousands of tiny &+Lblack eggs&+C and squirming larvae.
