&+LA Dark Cave&n~
   Hard garnite walls, crisscrossed with faint veins of &+rred&n ore, arch high
overhead where three large stalactites cling tentatively to the ceiling.
&+bWater&n condenses along the walls, causing the fifty-foot room to glisten and
magnify the perculiar &+rcrimson&n ore that inhabits the rock.  The air smells of
&+ydung&n, the scent getting stronger further toward the back of the cave.

   This rough tunnel is devoid of stalactites or stalagmites, but the strange

&+c This cold and desolate place is where &+CFirb Derstl&+c sends those few people
&+caccused of &+Ltreason&+c against the &+Yc&+Wr&+Yo&+Ww&+Yn&+c.  The ten foot area, that is the outpost
&+Rgallows&+c, is constructed from a &+rvermilion&+c stone of unknown nature.  Its
&+carchitects too long gone to reveal the source of their medium.  Set along the
&+csouth wall is a raised &+Wm&+wa&+Lr&+wb&+Wle&+c dais, its edges smoothed and beveled, in which
&+cis set a thick pole of the finest &+Wmithril&+c.  Encircling the rod, from its base
&+cto its pinnacle, are the finely etched lines of an ancient runic language.
&+cIn each of the &+Rgallows'&+c four corners, stands a ten foot &+Lonyx&+c statue.  Each
&+cidol holds a different instrument of law within its hands, a reminder of what
&+cthe condemned had abandoned.  The &+RPath of Honour&+c leaves to the north, and to
