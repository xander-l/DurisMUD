&+gShrine of Peace~
   This room feels like a safe place to rest.  A huge oak tree grows in the
center of the room, its leaves creating a canopy that blocks out the
weather almost totally.  The tree seems to look down at you with small
glowing eyes near its center.  A feeling of peace and safety comes over
anyone who stays here for more then a few seconds.

life or just to take things easy. This, is after, all an elven city, and as

   This is the throne room of the mighty elven king Quinliestnost, leader of
all the goodly elves of Duris.  His bejeweled throne rises here on a dais
some ten feet off the floor.  Glowing sunlight pours in from the ceiling above
in a rainbow of lights that bathe the entire room in a multitude of color that
drive all evil from the hearts of men and demi-humans.

   This area seems to be more well-tended than the rest of the city.  Wider
paths have been set up here, and small ponds as well as a mushroom glade and
a wide variety of plants and animals call this park home.  Small stone benches
are set up here and there at various points of interest in the park. A feeling
of peace comes over those who sit or walk within.

&+yThe Commons of the Sylvandawn Grovetree Theatre&N~
   &+gConstructed entirely within the growth of a massive oak, the walls
&+gof this building are living wood, and the high ceilinged beams are
&+gpainstakingly grown into existence instead of cut and placed. The
&+grich brown of the furnishings and the massive oak itself are laquered
&+gwith its own internal sap, providing a wonderful reflectivity, and
&+gallowing the entire interior to be lit with only a few magical floating
&+gglow spheres. The patrons laugh and sing around the many tables, and
&+gthe true spirit of what joy means amongst the Elves conveys a sense
&+gof wonderful well being, and undeniable peace. In a place where open
&+gminds come to laugh and sing and share countless tales, no one can leave
&+gwithout having made a few friends and feeling a bit more content with
&+glife. A massive spiral staircase, as occupied with patrons as the main
&+gfloor, leads up into the theatre proper.

   &+gWith the boughs arranged in the structure of amphitheater seats,
&+gthey all more or less face inwards and north to a thrusting procedium
&+gstage on which performances of all types take place. Be it a single
&+gbard reciting his latest masterpiece, or an entire troupe come to give
&+ga bit of tradgedy and cheer to the patrons, this delightful forum is
&+gthe perfect place to inspire the most delightful of experiences in the
&+gmost intimate of atmospheres with the audience. It is the home of the
&+greknowned Grovesinger's Troupe, who are said to give the highest
&+gquality of performance of almost anywhere. Above the theater itself is
&+gthe canopy of the oak's own broadleaves, allowing sun to filter in like
&+gthe ripples in water, or the starlight to cascade over everything in a
&+gfantastic manner. Small glow orbs hover in strategic places all around
&+gthe edge of the stage giving off soft light, their various shutters
&+gdirecting their flows in specific directions. There is a small plaque
&+gat the front of the stage written in flowing gold script.

&+gnon-impromptu shows await their final minutes before the moment of
&+gtruth in this room. Long, red velvet couches and iced fruit trays
&+gallow for the perfect picture of calm amongst chaos, the true
&+gvision of a person about to take the stage. Delicate, paper walls
&+gallow for the changing areas; each marked with an Elven rune; one
&+gfor 'she' and one for 'he.' Large bay windows of odd shapes that
&+g set into the natural spaces between boughs allow for the entrance
&+gof plenty of light, and the scenic pictures hanging in carefully
&+gplanned spots, along with the reading materials that are lying
&+gabout on the end tables make this almost feel like someone's home.

&+YThe Grovesinger's&+g Practice Room~
   &+gMagnificence is too small a word to convey to outsiders the true
&+gbeauty of this room. Neither lavish, nor dull, the deep and rich
&+gbrown of this living structure has been molded into a broad circle
&+gthat allows for a dizzying, panoramic view of most of the city of
&+gSylvandawn. Comfortable furniture is interspersed with polished
&+gbrass music stands and padded stools, allowing a broad choice of
&+gperformace and practice space, or simply comfortable listening
&+gseats. The walls between the windows are lines with music sheets,
&+gsome of which still glisten with freshly applied ink. They detail
&+gpoems and sung verse from not just Sylvandawn, but from cities and
&+glands across the known world; and from the look of some of these,
&+gperhaps even beyond that..

&+greknown in this area of the world. Filled with racks of practice
&+ginstruments and lesson books ranging on every subject from Artful
&+gActing to Zither Zealots; this room is never entirely quiet as
&+gthere is always more to teach, and practice is never enough. The
&+gMistress Grovesinger herself is never without an instrument to
&+gplay at any one moment, and she no doubt has the ability to play
&+gevery instrument in this room as a master. She is the leader, owner,
&+gand proprieter of the Grove Theatre, which was commisioned to her

this is only on one instrument!
