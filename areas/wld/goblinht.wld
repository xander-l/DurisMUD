&+yBefore an Earthen Slope~
&+y   A large earthen cliff looms above, the smooth surface just a bit too soft
&+yto hold a piton.  The only visible way up the side are narrow trails that snake
&+ytheir way up to a tunnel half way up the slope.  Nocks have been dug into
&+ythe hill on either side of the trail providing cover and a place to stand
&+yfor any that wish to watching the path.

&+mWithin the Private Chambers of the Mayor~
&+y   This is Moreg quarters where he carries out the business of being mayor,
&+ythis he regards as his private business.  Moreg always sits with his back
&+yagainst the wall, here behind his hardwood desk he keep careful tally of city
&+yexpenses and outlays.  At the farside of the room is an ill-used bed, the
&+yremaining walls are lined with cabinets stuffed full of papers.  To run a
&+ycity this size takes organization to run.

&+LIn a Dark Sepulchre~
&+L   You stand amidst a tangled jumble of broken coffins, a great rage has been
&+Lplayed out here.  Claw marks are etched deep into the rock, they cover a
&+Yglowing glyph &+Lthat survives the devastation.  A darkness darker then night
&+Lfills the room and a cold chill enters your body, something tells you this
&+Lisn't a place for the living.

&+mThe Entry to a &+LDark Crypt~
&+L   Once the tomb of a wealthy f&+wamily, it has been&+W recently modified to
&+Lsequester the necromancers gui&+wld.  A failed war &+Wwith the priests of Loviatar
&+Lhas resulted in the guild bei&+wng driven undergro&+Wund, figuratively and
&+Lliterally.  The people who b&+wuilt the tomb must&+W have been rich indeed, the
&+Lhallways are built with fin&+we marble thats bee&+Wn carved exquisitely.  Made as
&+La shrine to the dead no co&+wmpromises have bee&+Wn made for the living, this suits
&+Lthe necromancers just fine.

&+yAt the End of a Large Burrow~
&+y   This burrow is has obviously been occupied for sometime as it full of the
&+wbones &+yof many creatures from goblins to piercers.  The back of the cave is
&+ycovered in a &+Lblack &+ysubstance upon which luminous mushrooms have spawned,
&+yfilling the cave with an &+Geerie glow.

&+yAt a Turn in the Trail~
&+y   The narrow trail turns here and starts climbing up the slope.  The curve of
&+yslope prevents seeing where exactly this path goes.  Loose rocks tumble down
&+ythe slope to the underdark floor far below, how long this path has been here
&+yand how long it will last is uncertain.

&+yA Long Narrow Trail~
&+y   The narrow trail hangs precariously to the edge of the slope.  Loose sand
&+ytumbles its way down below with each footstep, yet the path holds.  The path
&+yruns up the slope towards a small opening above, and continues down to the
&+yfloor of the underdark below.

&+ythe trail.  Finally the path levels out and starts heading west, leaving time
&+yfor tired muscle to rest.  The path provides an excellent vantage point, a
&+ygood part of the underdark can be seen stretching into the distance.

&+yA Split in the Trail~
&+y   The trail widens a bit here and splits, one path crosses the slope
&+yeastward.  The other two paths run up and down the slope and soon disappear
&+ydue to the curviture of the hill.  All of these routes have been heavily
&+ytrodden both by creatures and people.

&+yAt a Turn in the Trail~
&+y   The path turns suddenly from heading down to crossing the slope westard,
&+yloose rocks make it hard to follow the path instead of the inevitable pull of
&+ygravity.  Far below the underdark stretches to the horizon, promising infinite
&+yhopes and infinite dangers.

&+yBefore a Large Hole~
&+y   The trail ends here at the mouth of a large tunnel.  Sturdy beams have been
&+yerected along the tunnels side and roof to give the tunnel strength.  The
&+ysounds of many feet and the many conversations can be heard ahead, some hushed
&+ywhispers and others triumphant shouts.  Four figures stand across the tunnel
&+yfurther to the north, and remain there unmoving.  This perch on the hill
&+yprovide an excellent view of the underdark below and the many paths that
&+ycrisscross their way up the slope.  As if anticipating attack ballistas have
&+ybeen erected here and many rocks and bolts stacked beside them.

&+y   The trail ends here before a large cave, the flickering light of a fire
&+ycan be seen dancing on the cave walls.  Many foot prints can be seen in the
&+ysoft dirt, mostly humanoid but some not.  Feet, hooves, and claws can all be
&+yseen on the soft ground.

&+yleaving nothing but loose rocks.  Some strange looking plants have dropped
&+yroots here trying to feed on the water cascading down the slope.  Oddly their
&+yvine like branches seem to move and twitch with anticipation.

&+yhold on to.  The trail leads back up the slope but not before providing a
&+ygreat vantage point for viewing the underdark floor far below.

&n   Everything here is pure fire, flames shoot endlessly into the sky
&nas the intense heat melts almost all matter.
&nEvery direction, there are flames and fire, once in awhile a small island of
&nmolten rock floats or drifts by.  Gravity does not seem to be in affect
&nand travel looks possible in any direction.

&n   The currents of the plane of water flow around you and
&nmove you in random directions from time to time.  Its hard to
&nkeep your barings in the endless murky depths.  You can feel lost at times.
&nThe crushing pressure of this place would kill you in an instant were it not
&nfor the magical protection you have brought with you.

&+Y   This is where the advanced conjurers practice their spells before they are
&+Yunleashed on the world.  Many iron walls are in the room, some lying flat and
&+Yothers standing up, all in all an bizarre sight.  A table at one side of the
&+Yroom is covered in swords to be enchanted and later sold.  Two students sit
&+Yhere deeply engrossed in their latest exercise, identifying several potions
&+Ythat Gimbatul lost the labels for.

&+YGimbatul has his own desk, though its awash in half marked exams and
&+Yincomplete magical proofs.  With such clutter its a wonder how Gimbatul finds

&+LInn &+bof the &+LTwisted &+rSpine~
&+y   Once called Brogan's inn, this inn is now known as the inn of the twisted
&+yspine, at least by everyone that's slept here.  It has many rooms, all small,
&+yeach dug out of the surrounding dirt.  Some loose straw spread upon the uneven
&+yfloor being the only place to sleep.  A large sign hanging behind the counter
&+yreads:

&+rAll guests are expected to sweep their rooms before checking out.

&+yBrogan's Bar~
&+y   Smelling of cheap beer and &+gpuke, &+ythis bar is home to most of the cities
&+yne'er-do-wells.  Once too often broken furniture is held together with old
&+ytwine.  &+rBlood &+yand &+gvomit &+ystains the floors, where an occasional footstep will
&+ysend a long forgotten &+wtooth &+yskittering by.

&+LLoviatar, also known as the maiden of pain, appears as a tall beautiful woman.
&+LShe wields an immense barbed whip, and wears a tattered robe of black cloth
&+Land little else.  The statues eyes are alight with rapture as though the

&+yabreast, four guards stand here.  The only way in and out of the city is
&+ythrough the guards, some may come through for free but many more must provide
&+ysome incentive for the guards to part.  Being barely paid if at all, bribes
&+yprovide the guards with most of their wages.  Large iron gates are held open
&+ywith ropes that can be cut in times of trouble providing barriers to invaders.

&+L   This cave was formed long ago out of limestone by the action of water, drip
&+Lby drip.  Stalagmites that were once here have been broken off, leaving a
&+Lsmooth path for those coming and going.  Fine sand formed of broken rock
&+Lcovers the floor of the cave.  The imprints of many hooved and footed

&+Lnow gone, or grossly mutated.  &+BHot water &+Land &+Rflames &+Lhave melted them as shaman
&+Lpractice their new spells.  The cave branches here, one branch continuing

&+Llined with hooks, many items hang here made from natural materials.  Items
&+Lfrom necklaces of skulls, to carvings, to beads.  All can be bought, for the

&+cogres.  All this made from the iron ore mined near by.  A large forge at the

&+W   This intersection is where people come and gather when there is trouble.  A
&+Wlarge fountain is here which is used largely by the poorer members of the
&+Wcommunity, as the better off have plumbing.  The streets here are covered in
&+Wcobblestones, periodic small holes allow water to drain from the streets.  To
&+Wthe north stretchs the High Road, which is home to most of the finest shops in
&+WMoregeeth.  The the west is the Street of Guilds which contains most of the
&+Wcities guild houses, as well as the inn.  A large hole lined with ladders

&+y   This is the armpit of Moregeeth, and the lowest point in town.  To the
&+ynorth is the Lower Road along which lives most of the poor and dejected in
&+ytown.  To the west is the street the townsfolk call the Street of the Dead
&+ybecause it has the cemetery and guards barracks.  As the townspeople like to
&+yjoke, the dead and the soon to be dead.  A large hole above has been lined
&+ywith two ladders and leads upto the upper quarters of the town.  The streets
&+yhere are dirt roads, a ditch along the side helps drain water to this point
&+ywhere it flows out of town along with an underground stream.  The same
&+yunderground stream that enters town at the end of the Lower Road with clean
&+yclear water.

&+y   When the town was built this was the main street, but now most of the well-
&+yto-do live on the Street of Nobles.  This road is populated with all the
&+ywretched town folks that barely eke out an existence.  The street is little
&+ymore then an open sewer, a ditch along it carries water and sewage from the
&+yriver north of town to the south where it drains into the underdark.

&+ynotice everyone on the streets keeps to themselves, walking quickly to spend

&+Mif any commoners come into this part of town, mostly just servants running

&+Mthrough the bank, mostly since its far too dangerous to walk the streets with

&+Mthe Street of Nobles.  Probably to be closer to their money.

&+Yhere.  Not really of noble blood or birth they are simply the wealthiest
&+Ypeople in town and so titled as they please.  The street is paved with cobble-
&+Ystones and well drained, it is clean and wide.  To the south is a typical
&+Yhome of a noble, its exterior is designed to flaunt the wealth of its
&+Yoccupant.  To the north is the mayor's residence, reputed to be cunning and
&+Yruthless there are few that dare knock on his door.
