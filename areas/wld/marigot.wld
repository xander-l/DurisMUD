&+bThe Pa&+Bthw&+bay of the Pri&+Bnces&+bs&n~
   The road here is about twenty-five feet wide. This Pathway of
the Princess is one of the major arteries serving the Fort of Marigot.
Dark granite and slabs of marble form an interlocking mosaic of masonry
on this well-traveled road.  A dark forest lines the north part of this
pathway.  Foraging about are a few forest animals. The castle of the
princess can be seen further east from here where a large gathering
appears to be taking place.  This part of the pathway is free from
rubbish and other debris.

&+yBefore the &+WGates &+yof Fort &+MMarigot&n~
    Many eyes from above mark every movement below.  The walls of
Fort Marigot are of solid blocks of granite.  A few of the blocks
have begun to show signs of age with small cracks in their walls.
The entryway into Fort Marigot is lined with marble. Beyond the
iron gates lies the city of Fort Marigot, the home of the centaurs.
There are two exits leading away in opposite directions.

&+yA Small Dirtpath&n~
    A small dirtpath leads in an east-west direction cutting
through the dense forest seen further south.  There are prints
left by many different types of creatures in the earth here. A
large fort structure can be seen further to the east.  Many eyes
from the sentry posts watch your every move.  There are two exits
leading away in opposite directions.
