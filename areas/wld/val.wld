&nFirst Floor of a &+GGrand Staircase&n~
   A massive staircase opens up here. It spirals up several stories. Each step
has been crafted from a solid golden hued wood and laid down with care and
forethought. A heavy handrail follows along the staircase's edge to provide
extra support to anyone requiring it. Delicate leaves have been carved along
the railing, spreading along its surface like a living plant. The leaves seem
to stretch up the whole width of the staircase, an effect that must have taken
months to carve. An opening can be seen leading to the east towards a hallway
of some sort. This is the central staircase of the great castle and the only
way to get to the second and upper level. There are rumors floating around that
the Queen and King have secret passages hidden within the castle. The stairs
continue up.

&+MA Majestic Hallway~
   A polished tiled floor delivers an awe inspired gasp. The foreign tiles that
were used to build the floor are exotic and must have cost a small fortune.
The tile color sparkles with emotion and brings a joyful tone to the castle.
They are smooth to the touch with out so much as a grain of dirt among them.
The floor adjoins with the castle walls to deliver a wide walkway. With a
span of over ten feet, this castle walk allows quick passage even during the
unparallel social gatherings that the king and queen tend to throw. Above, a
silverish lantern hangs down, giving light to the otherwise unlighted. A
stairway opens up to the west however and two stone statues stand erect in
front of a some curtains. On either side of those curtains is the Throne Room.
Each of the statues wield two-handedly a huge double-bladed battle axe. Their
plates of armor bare the symbol of the royal guard of Valois.

The &+LEntrance &nto the &+bThrone Room~
   Huge blue curtains hang down from above. They are nailed into the arched
stone ceiling above. The king's Throne Room is to the east and the room is
guarded at all times by royal guards. The curtains are made of a fine silk
that was a gift from the Elven kingdom. The ceiling has the resemblance of
an arch for it is curved into a semi-circle where it then forms up with the
walls. The tiles on the floor are grand to see and put a joyful feeling into
the air. Sounds of political questions and addresses of many business problems
can be heard. The throne room is where the king and queen have audiences with
the nobles of the land. Many emissaries from far away come to castle Valois to
discuss matters with its king.

The &+bThrone Room~
   Many matters of the kingdom are handled here. Businessmen from all across
the land come here to offer deals to the king and ambassadors from foreign
lands come here to discuss politics. All who enter here are allowed to address
the king and queen themselves. If anyone dares to offend them in any way, they
would be assuredly hustled out of the throne room and furthermore banned from
appearances with the royal family. No one in this kingdom would ever want to
anger or upset the king, so manners are important. A royal carpet is unrolled
from east all the way to the curtains to the west. Many banners are hung on the
walls to symbolize the peace and tranquility that discussion rather than war
brings. Soldiers of the royal guard are kept by the king's side at all times.
The smell of roses lingers in the air.

   The grass is a lovely shade of green. The gardeners take great care of these
gardens. The lawn is well trimmed however and flowers give off a sweet scent
into the air. The flowers blossom with beauty because of all the fresh sunlight
they get. This garden, unlike many others, has a great many long well trimmed
bushes cut neatly and squarely along the ground in order to form a maze. The
maze continues in all directions and is very refreshing. The little maze is
easily navigable and is used for the enjoyment of little kids. Within the
center of the maze lays a small pond. The pond was engineered for beauty and
is a place for children to play. Small toys can be seen around the pond, rods,
small figures, and other things to play with too.

   There is a beautiful pond here. The water is drinkable thanks to the clerics
that regularly visit. The little pond has dimensions of five by five and has
been perfectly engineered exactly to those measurements. The grass is well
trimmed and a beautiful color green. An assortment of f&+rlo&+gw&+re&+gr&+Gs&n are planted just
outside of the rim of the pond. Many roses put an intoxicating smell into
the air. This is the perfect spot for relaxation and forgetting the rest of the
world. Not only is this the perfect medicine for anxiety or pressure, but this
garden is used during the nights to observe the night sky, to study the stars
for the good of scientific community. The balcony just overhead is rather
low to the ground and it might be possible to scale the wall if one was daring.

   The gardeners of the castle have kept the gardens looking well. It is a
remarkable color green and is well trimmed and beautiful. The garden has a
variety of flowers blossoming. These flowers are exotic and undoubtedly from
Valoisian allies. Unlike the public gardens, this one has only one bench to
rest upon. The flowers put an intoxicating scent into the air. An extraordinary
view awaits those at night thanks to the efforts and creativity of the
architects of the castle. This castle is one of the wonders of the world
because it is very immense with so many new design principles attributed to
it. During the night it is rumored that the queen likes to take walks in this
private garden without any personal escort. This is her one true time to be
alone. The chill of the night air doesn't let her stay out too long but she
enjoys it none the less. The garden smells wonderful and the sky is overhead.

The servants are often seen cleaning these halls during all hours of the day
and even into the night. They love their king and take great pride in what
they do. Foreigners visiting the castle are often impressed with the dedication
of these people to their king and queen.

Inside the &+mRoyal Gates~
   The two parapets on either side of the gate are great against attacks.
Although this castle has never been under siege, the soldiers above have been
trained to dump boiling grease and to fire arrows on the enemy. The horrors
of war have never touched this castle thankfully so these soldiers have still
innocent of such atrocities. The loyal defenders of the king would give him
to escape or time for reinforcements to arrive. Archers on the upper level
cleanly cut down enemy forces from afar. The lower level parapet is where the
boiling oil is kept. If ever the wall would be breached the guards on this
parapet would ensure that the first few opposing forces would be methodically
burned into oblivion. The castle walls are made of stone, brick, and mortar.
It seems that the these walls were dug into the ground a good ten feet. The
southern gate has always been secure and will remain so for years to come. It
is a solid fortress armed with the finest soldiers and brilliant engineers.
This castle is impregnable. &n

&+gA Servant Access Hallway&n~
   The hallway is a small corridor allowing quick and easy passage for the
servants and gives them access around the castle unseen to do the work that
he guests should not bear witness to view. There are no ornaments on the
walls unlike most of the castle. There are no pictures. Small lanterns dangle
from the ceiling for the purposes of providing and allowing the servants to
see. The king never comes down this way. Only the servants use this access
walkway. No royal guards are here either. It is completely noble less. Nothing
is as glamorous as it is with the rest of the castle. It is just a simple
passageway made of stone.

&nA &+gServant's &nRoom&n~
   A vague room with little to no access to fire or any other luxury that
the nobles so easily take for granted. A small bed provides comfort and a
resting place for a tired servant. The sheets upon the bed are made of wool
and should do well to trap body heat to keep one warm. A small wooden desk
forms the servants dresser and a long bench serves to allow guests the luxury
of sitting down. A lantern upon the bench provides light. This is where
some of the castle's servants dwell during the night hours. It also is the
refuge for tired servants that have traveled the length of the lands with
their lords and masters, only to have no lodging readily available to them.

A Massive &+LStone Kitchen~
   The elaborate nature of the kitchen only spells one thing, gnomes. It is
a wonder how this kitchen came into being. The king and queen of Valois must
have had terrible architects and engineers to rely so heavily upon the gnomes.
Little inventions provide fire safely and in a controlled manner around the
room. The fire allows for the cooking of food and warming of water. Pots and
pans dangle from a large elaborate rope that spreads the entire kitchen.
Stone tablets upon tables allows for the cutting of meat without the damaging
of the wooden tables underneath.

&+w&+LA Hallway &nlined with &+L&+LSuits of Armor&n~
   Marvelous suits of armor fill the hallway on either side. Suits ranging
from ceremonial to actual suits of arms that have been used in battle. A few
of them need a little mending, for they have a few unsightly dents in them.
The suits of arms are each standing on their own separate metal slab. These
suits are kept clean it is obvious, for it would not take long for dust to pile
up. Not one, but many of these suits have been made by elven, or dwarven
hands. Fine elven chain mail stands out from the rest and dwarven plate mail has
obviously been well crafted. The king and queen must try to keep up relations
with both races, for trade and military reason alike, which is why they are
meant to be here. Servants can be seen racing along this hallway during all
hours, especially during the day when the castle receives the most guests.

&+bA Regal Banquet Room&n~
   There is a huge ballroom floor here. A fireplace provides light and
heat along with a few torches periodically placed upon the walls. A large
rectangular table is in the center of the room with chairs to accompany it.
The purpose of this banquet room is not only to dine, but to talk politics
with Valoisian neighbors. Pictures outline the walls of the room. Pictures of
fine elven make and dwarven alike are here. A few gnome gadgets can be found
mounted upon the walls too, they are not to be touched, however as a small
sign reads "-Touch at your own risk". This is where the king and queen
entertain the majority of their guests. Everyone who dances on this floor is
of noble status and has received years and years of lessons in the art of
dancing.

&nSecond Floor&n of a &+GGrand Staircase&n~
   Railings on either side of the steps provide for support for the elderly
and handicapped. This humongous staircase could hold a number of people at
once. It is obvious that this means of traveling up and down a level inside
the castle is well used. Tiny leaves have been intricately carved on the wood
which further provides a little more support along with an amusing spectacle.
The steps and rails have been made of the strongest wood in the kingdom, a type
of Valoisian oak. The Staircase continues upwards however, hallways towards the
north and south hint that it has reached one of its designated floors.

Tapestries along the wall give life boring hallway. The tapestries have been
woven with delicate care and must weigh a hundred pounds or so. The artwork
upon  tapestries show a great deal of noble men and women within the
kingdom that have made their name in some mannerly fashion in order to obtain
the king's recognition. However, a few of the tapestries are of the kingdom of
Valois and its neighboring kingdoms. Dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and

here and security is tight. No one is admitted without the king himself here
giving the orders to the guards. Pikeman patrol the corridors at all times.
Tapestries along the wall give life boring hallway. The tapestries have been
woven with delicate care and must weigh a hundred pounds or so. The artwork
upon  tapestries show a great deal of noble men and women within the
kingdom that have made their name in some mannerly fashion in order to obtain
the king's recognition. However, a few of the tapestries are of the kingdom of
Valois and its neighboring kingdoms. Dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and
barbarians alike share with each other culture.

&+RThe Meeting Room~
   The majority of the space within the chamber is reserved for the commission
and not the ambassador himself. These commissions are sent here by other
nations to discuss matters of importance. The king of Valois is both powerful
and wise. He discusses and resolves a great deal of trade disputes and manages
to do well for the kingdom of Valois. The ambassadorial commission of each of
the kingdoms is composed of the ambassador, the assistant, a deputy director
within their kingdom, a general with high power within the military forces
ruling reach kingdom, and finally the porters. Housing all of commissions is
a heavy task met with an iron fist by the King himself in which all of the
delegates are grateful for they receive better care and courtesy within Valois
than their hometowns. A large circular table stands in the center of the
chamber. Each of the respected kingdoms has a spot predetermined by the king.
Valois its at the head and the elven kingdom at the far end. Behind the table
is where the actual commission stands when a meeting has commenced to lend
moral support as well as factual information that the ambassador could not or
would not know otherwise.

&+LEntrance to the &+RMeeting Room~
   A door covered in a royal banner blocks the inside the chamber towards the
east. The door has been made of wood with a small peek hole towards the center
of it to allows communication to those inside of the chamber with a Valoisian
official on the other side. This messaging is necessary for when the chamber
is in session no one is allowed in and no one is allowed out. Guards posted
here uphold their post with the greatest vigil and prevent any unauthorized
entry. The guards posted here will fight to the death to protect all of the
royalty inside the meeting room. It is here that the future of the land is
decided.

&+gA Gar&+Lden Bal&+gcony~
   Columns run up and down here. They are columns made of marble and uphold the
ceiling and also provide support for this level of the castle. The columns are
of the Corinth design and have been wonderfully carved by master artisans. The
hallway echoes all of the sounds in it, so whether it be the creatures of the
night that chirp or the arguing of the delegations of foreign lands, every
sound comes back to its originator. Some say that this balcony was engineered
to do so to allow the incompetence of an ambassador to be heard by his own ears
while others say it's just a flaw in the design.

&nThird Floor of a &+GGrand Staircase&n~
   The sprawling staircase comes to an end on the third floor, opening up into
the royal family's private floor. Only their personal guests are allowed access
to this floor, leaving it one of the least crowded areas of the castle grounds.
A crimson carpet lined with golden trim, meets the top most stair here. It
leads away from the staircase, creating an elegant path for the king and his
guests to travel. A pair of potted plants stand here upon circular wooden
tables. Their thick green leaves spread out several feet, each one blanketing
a simple white flower. The flower's fragrance blends with the moist earth in
the clay pots to create a pleasant odor that wafts along the staircase.

An &+LIntersection&n of &+LHallways~
   Few people have the luxury of viewing this conjunction of hallways for it
is the nearest hallway to the king's chambers. A few torches hitched upon the
walls provide for adequate lighting in the absence of sunlight, which could
never find its way here for there are no windows. The northern stone wall has
something upon it, an engraving of sorts on a square sheet of metal with
some scribbling upon it. Sounds easily echo within this intersection. Eastward,
pictures are visible hanging from either side of the hallway on the walls, and
towards the west a staircase can be seen. The kingdom of Valois is nothing
without its king, and if something were to happen to him the kingdom would
assuredly fall into chaos. The king has personal body guards that are both
powerful and wise that follow him around at all times.

&nThe &+bKing's &nPrivate &+w&+LBedchambers&n~
   Carelessly tossed around the room are the king's clothes. His clothes range
from being on his bed to on top of his burnt out candle on his working desk. His
working desk is made of a strong wood oak that is very difficult to catch
ablaze. On top of the king's desk are a few charts and graphs that are barely
visible beneath his wardrobe. There are water, diplomacy, construction, and
even economic charts that further proclaim Valois as the wealthiest kingdom in
the land. A carpet lays at the foot of the kings bed with a picture of his
white stallion horse upon it. A window allows for fresh air. The king often
spends his nights alone. His soul bodyguard is a man he's known all his life.
Yuppi is the caretaker to the king who has taught and instructed him in many
arts and crafts. He is an intelligent wizard who has the gift of foresight that
has served the king for many years. It has warned the king time and again of
possible plots against him.

amuse the populous. A wooden door with a little sliding panel for the purposes
of identifying all those who would knock upon it is to the east. The king and
his family live on this level of the castle. No one besides the king and a few
retainers ever have access to this level. Anyone caught trespassing would be
sent straight to the dungeons to be questioned.

&nThe &+g&+LQueen's&n Private &+w&+cBedchambers~
   Sexy two piece outfits lay sprawled across the bedside. Marvelous jewels lay
on top of them. Diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, and other precious are all among
the queen's fancies. A hard wooden floor upholds the Queen's bedroom and allows
for an uncanny amount of weight to be placed upon it. Dressers and various
necessities such as shelves and cabinets outline the Queen's chamber. A few
torches along the walls allow for easy access to light when the sun sets.
There isn't much to see her except whatever the queen fancies. She spends most
of her time with the king in his private chambers or with the prince or
princess. The queen has very little time of her own.

   This balcony hovers above the private royal gardens. No one is admitted into
these gardens without great prestige. Ambassadors from foreign nations and
the kings personal friends are the only ones who are frequently admitted to the
wonderfully relaxing gardens. The king himself has commented on how beautiful
the gardens are and has awarded the designers and caretakers grants to continue
their work. This balcony is made out of a special wood only found in Valois,
and it is strong and durable. There is a roof made of wooden shingles overhead.
The queen's private chambers are to the west.

   Few citizens of Valois have the honor of visiting the prince in his private
chambers. Maids attend to his every need at all times since his mother the
queen has such a demanding schedule. The prince is not without comfort however
for he has ever toy imaginable within his grasps for the elven and dwarven
ambassadors sour him with gifts. The prince's bed is huge however, considering
his age and size for it can fit two grown men on it at one time. Many of the
pictures that hang from the wall are of his sister, father, and mother. There
are a few pictures that he himself painted, and they are framed in gold.

Portraits of herself are setup on her dresser. A fabulous carpet covers the
foot of her bed. It looks to have been made by elven hands and looks to cost a
small fortune. A walk-in closet allows for the princess to store all of her
bare essentials, such as her dresses and valuable jewelry. The queen often
comes to visit the princess to check up on her. The queen's handmaidens have
taken a fancy to her and constantly keep an eye out.

legends in their own time. Many of the portraits along the walls resemble the
respected individual with remarkable precision in every detail. The portraits
range from just showing the neck to hair to full body portraits. The king's own
picture sticks out from the rest, the picture of himself atop his valiant white
stallion Scipio dressed in his full set of arms. His majesty's family are also
among the portraits, each and every one of them life-size and painted with
exact precision. The artistry that comes into this great castle comes from many
different artists from all around the world. It is unparallel and is priceless
and the king cares for all of these paintings with delicate care.

   This simple dining area has been set aside for the royal family and their
more intimate guests. The walls here are covered with dark wooden panels,
scenting the furniture. Consisting of a long rectangular table and several
high backed chairs, this furniture seems to have been selected for its simple,
yet appealing style of craftsmanship. Several brass candle holders are placed
along the dark polished table surface, casting a pale illumination upon anyone
feasting in the room. Several brass lamps hang from the walls as well, adding
their soft glow with the candles to provide adequate lighting to this modest
room. A few simple paintings and tapestries hang from the walls, adding a
touch of color to the otherwise dark theme of this room. The queen enjoys
entertaining special guests here. She orders some of the most expensive wine
and asks the cooks to come up with some of the most extraordinary meals. She
is a lover of fine dining and good times.

&nThe &+bRoyal&n &+BLibrary&n~
   Books number in the thousands in this great library. Everything that has
ever been written that has been worth collecting is here. Huge shelves allow
for easy storage while a ladder or two provides the librarian easy access to all
of the books for the shelves stand a good twenty feet high. The librarian's desk
is relatively small compared to the shelves, however, it houses the necessary
materials and memos for ordering any number of accommodating books his majesty
or his majesty's family would desire. A lantern or two allows for artificial
sunlight when the sun has set. This library is often visited by special guests
of the castle looking for specific knowledge. Rumors have spread throughout the
kingdom that the king has copies of some of the most powerful books every
written and those seeking them have come here to find them. Not just anyone can
enter this library, only those with outstanding prestige or great wealth.

   The ladder stretches along the wall to allow access to the Queen's quarters
only if they know the whereabouts of the ladder's base. The ladder's base is
hidden behind some brush and is impossible to see. The ladder is quite well
hidden from ordinary onlookers from the garden below also, for the ladder
remains is embedded into the wall itself, making it very difficult to see from
any possible angle on the ground. The ladder is made from only the best of
trees, oak. It is said that the queen likes to stroll around at night in the
private gardens. This ladder leads to those gardens from her bedchamber above.
This is the one time of the day that the queen is totally vulnerable, however,
she is safe from harm since no intruder could possibly sneak into the castle.

   This road leads to the great castle Valois. Valois is the greatest castle in
all the lands. It is the meeting place of all of the races of the world. They
discuss matters of the state and trade. It is the one place that all the races
can come together to discuss their interests. It is also one of the most secure
castles in all of the land and boasts an army greater than most. The elves
enjoy this great castle and the many luxuries it affords. The dwarven nation
marvels at the design of this castle and the architecture within. The humans
don't pay much attention to the king or the castle but are resolved to work out
their own interests. The barbarians enjoy the celebrations and the food that
the great castle serves. Ulgris, the king of the castle, has an estate larger
than most provinces. He has a royal line of retainers that are powerful in
their own ways and just as rich and influential. The great king relies on their
expertise and their loyalty. Having great retainers makes a great king. This
cobblestone road was built years ago when the castle was first built. It isn't
much but it is the only road leading to the great Voloisian castle.

Before the &+rDu'kel Mansion~
   There are two loyal guards protecting the front entrance of the kingdom's
largest mansion, which belongs to Lord Du'Kel. Lord Du'kel is the king's most
trusted ally. He is a powerful retainer and a master of logistics. Having a
man who knows how to move arms and men must be trustworthy and good with
numbers. Lord Du'Kel was a brilliant soldier in his life and an even more
brilliant pusher of wars. He has served the king faithfully for any number of
years in any number of ways. His insignia is that of a flaming dragon. It is
embedded into the two doubled doors of the mansion, which is very large and
has a many stained glass windows with many different designs upon them. The
mansion was constructed using wood, brick, stone, and mortar. There is a small
fence running the perimeter of a plush green yard which keeps small animals
out. The king depends on his retainers for support and if Lord Du'Kel ever
turned against him then he would be doomed for sure politically.

Before a &+LLarge Courtyard~
   The king's castle rises a good thirty feet in the air to the north. Guards
forever pace the parapets never to let up their guard even though they are,
in their minds, in the safest spot within the realm. The brilliant black
cobblestones that make up the road are perfectly square and have been laid out
purposely to form a well constructed non-faulty road that gives pleasure to
the nobles that live nearby. The guests of Valois are often taken by the
exquisite design and craftsmanship of the royal roads. Great care has been
taken and afforded in the building of these roads and are the source of great
pride throughout the realm. The great king of Valois resides in the castle to
the north and his loyal retainers support him inasmuch as they can and they are
very powerful. He has rid the nearby plains of orcs and destroyed the hordes
demons in the mountains to the north. He is the greatest king in all the land.

The &+bRoyal Weapon Shop~
   This weapon shop is much larger then the ones found elsewhere in Valois,
due to the large amount of business it does with the royal family and their
honor guard. Nearly all the knights within Valois use weapons from this shop,
getting a small discount for serving their city. Racks of different weapons
line the thick wooden walls of this establishment, and although far from the
cheapest in Valois, their quality goes unmatched. A dark wooden counter
stretches across the northern section of the store, prohibiting entrance to the
forge room located behind it. The king often comes by this shop to inspect the
goods and to converse with the smithy. The smithy enjoys the king's company
and its said that the two are good friends.

   The heat within this backroom is nearly overwhelming as it pours from the
blazing depths of a stone weapon forge. Billows of smoke travel their way up a
slender chimney, emptying into the sky above. Some manages to escape the
breeze however, wafting around the room like captured clouds. A huge barrel of
water lies near the forge, used to cool off weapons as they are being worked
into shape. Several different tools hang from the walls, all used in the
construction of fine weaponry. The smithy uses this forge to mend weapons
and armor. He has a few blacksmiths working for him at all hours of the day.

Along the Highest Wall~
   The southern wall of the royal castle of Valois shoots toward the sky. The
castle wall at the peak is thirty feet. The strong wall was neatly constructed
and the royal house spared no expense at making it perfect. The neatly carved
black stones are very smooth. They lay on top of each other perfectly which
means that they've been cut and shaved into a perfect proportional horizontal
building block. Paved cobblestones make up the road and allows easy traveling
for caravans and wagons. Sounds of guards patrolling the parapets gently puts
a stir in the air. During all times of the day this road is busy. Merchants,
warriors, and passing caravans run on this road. They belong to the lords
surrounding the great castle who are as powerful as they are wealthy. They've
immense wealth as retainers to the king of the castle. The wind sends some
dirt into the air.

The &+yRoyal Armor Shop~
   The massive shop set aside to be used by the royal armor smith is quite
spacious, which is one of the reasons this position is so sought after. Only
those specifically appointed to the position are allowed to dwell within the
royal sector of Valois. This in itself is quite an honor, but to be able to
serve the royal army and Valoisian knights by providing them with suitable
armor is even greater. The shop is about thirty feet across, crafted from
heavy stone bricks and wooden panels. The interior walls have been plastered
over and currently are decorated with several different suits of completed
armor. A small doorway leads south, into what appears to be the main forge.

&+L&+LA Stone Armor Forge&n~
   Heat from a large forge fire creates an immense thresh hold that very few
within the kingdom can step into. Forgers have hardened themselves overtime to
handle the incredible amount of heat their forge fires produce, however, it
takes a forger many years to do this. Working within this sphere of heat is
only one worry of the life of a forger because they could very easily mutilate
themselves if they lose their concentration. Many forgers have apprentices to
learn from them and to continue their work when they're no longer able,
however, it takes many years to master the art of forging. Huge racks hold
weapons in the northern corner of the room. Shields that have yet been
completed lay sprawled out on a few tables.

The &+LKitchen~
   The scent of cooking food is overwhelmingly pleasant throughout the kitchen.
Pots bowl over with steamed vegetables and fresh bird roasts over an open
flame. Pies and desserts of endless variety bake within the huge black iron
stove here, sending up an aroma that can set anyone's mouth watering. Pots and
pans hang from the ceiling and walls, each one scrubbed perfectly clean. The
floors are of polished wood, the shine coming from them hinting that they are
scrubbed daily. Three open windows let the collected steam and smoke waft from
the kitchen, allowing the room to stay somewhat cool despite the stove and
cooking area.

The &+gCommon Room&n of the &+LWa&+Gili&+Lng Gri&+Gff&+Lon~
   Unlike many of the taverns nearby Valois, this one lacks the pungent scent
of old ale and sweat. The common room is quite elegant, decorated with tasteful
art and expensive rugs. Several round wooden tables dot the room, each one
providing enough seats for five individuals. The fresh scent of smoke wafts up
from a nearby fireplace, which crackles loudly near the southern wall.
Tapestries and paintings hang from the wall, most depicting Valoisian nobles
in different states. Some are of royal hunts and others of massive parties. It
is quite obvious by the decor, only the rich are welcome here. The king is said
to have a drink here from time to time because he enjoys mingling with his
people. The kingdom of Valois has always had great kings and queens and this
one is no exception.

&nInside the &+bRoyal&+y Stables&n~
   This room smells horribly of dung. It is amazing that this Stable Jock is
still in business for his customers must endure much in order to purchase
mounts that readily stink. A mixture of ponies, stallions, and war horses
remain behind closed cages wondering when they'll be released from this hell
hole. The ground is covered in hay for some strange reason. Oat buckets are
ever present within range of all the horses reach for they have to eat too.
Water buckets are lacking for each pin however, and the only source of fresh
water within the vicinity is the pale hanging on the western wall near the exit
of the stables. A small table stands off in the corner and obviously has and
still is being used for business purposes for Licub.

A &+gBeautiful C&+ro&+gu&+rrt&+gya&+rrd~
   Flowers bloom on the rims of a small fountain. This is a beautiful
courtyard built long ago when the kingdom was still young by one of the kings
most powerful retainers, lord Du'kel. There is a lot not known about the
great lord except that he is one of the kings most adamant supporters. They
say a great king has even greater retainers for support. Lord Du'Kel is one
of the most successful business men in all the realm, selling his services
and bartering his goods for the good king and country. The courtyard has been
used for celebrations and an occasional ball. It is said that lord Du'Kel was
once a fearsome warrior in his youth and he has served the king for years
since childhood. He is a loyal retainer to the king and has served him in many
campaigns. The smell of flowers lingers in the air.

   An elegant carpet has been rolled out from the doors towards the huge
stairway that allows access towards the upper sections of the mansion. There
are a few windows here. They allow light to shine in from the east in the early
mornings and again when the sun sets in the west. This is the mansion of lord
Du'Kel, the greatest retainer to the throne the king has. He is powerful in the
art of war and a logistical genius. Servants are often running through here on
some sort of errand for the great lord. He is renown throughout the castle as a
man to be trusted. The king himself has given him special permissions afforded
to none other. During times of crisis the king can count on lord Du'Kel for
support financially and politically.

   The steps are covered in a purple carpet. The steps run up twenty feet
before adjoining with another set of steps to form a step intersection. Above
the intersection their is a large woven tapestry with a picture of the kingdom
of Valois upon it. A door leads to another room inside the mansion on either
side of the staircase. Lord Du'kel enjoys celebrations. He throws the grandest
parties in all the land. He has massive amounts of funding and he spends it
lavishly on all sorts of intoxicants. One of his greatest attributes is his
generosity.

to the library within the castle of Valois, however, it does have a quite of
number of books to choose from. A small desk with a lantern atop of it has a
sign that reads "Be ever so SILENT please while in this library." Obviously
the lords of the mansion do not like to be disturbed in their time of study and

obvious that the kitchen staff lacks motivation to do their jobs right. A back
door to the kitchen allows simple and quick access to the dining room
southward. The pots and pans that the kitchen's staff have managed to clean
hang down from a wooden poll along the northern wall. A combination of
sinks allows for the staff of the kitchen to wash dishes rather quickly.
Cooks are hired from all around to cook for this great lord. When he throws
a party they serve enough food to feed a small army. He pays them well.

The plates and bowls are delicate and one of a kind. A few gold candle holders
that hold eleven candles at a time lay at the center and ends of the table.
The napkins look as though they should framed for they have been made of an

Special guests stay here. Servants attend to their every need. They are usually
reserved for outside lords that are great friends with the lord of the house.
Lord Du'Kel allows nobles from far away to stay on this second floor. They

   Pigeons flap their wings toward the fresh water that the fountain in the

cobblestones are used to keep weeds from growing and to keep boot ware clean. A
large lawn on either side of the courtyard is elevated about two feet into the
air. The lawn provides a nice place for relaxation. They are nice for picnics.
On either side of the fountain are two large Onyx Griffons. They seem to be
squatting with their talons flashing. Their wings are outstretched and it's a
wonder why they don't just fly toward the sky. This mansion belongs to one of
the kings most powerful retainers.

A &+LBlack Onyx Hall~
   What other way to build a chamber within a large mansion than using onyx.
Onyx creates a sphere of darkness that can intimidate the most hardened of
souls. Onyx is also, very expensive and no other soul except one who has none
could achieve that amount of wealth it would require to use onyx in the
construction of his hall. It is obvious from the purple carpet on the floor
that the expenditure of this noble knows no bound, which is good for the
market, however, not for his own pocket book. The color purple is specifically
reserved for the royal family and although having a carpet made of that color
is no crime, it isn't cheap and only one manufacturer within the realms of the
land creates that color dye.

One of the many luxuries of being rich is being able to have anything you could

He is slightly balding with a crest on his upper right shoulder. Of the three
great lords of Valois, Berani is one of them. He isn't the brightest nor the
richest, but he throws the most outlandish parties and celebrations. He is a
generous host at parties and a loving husband and father. He speaks with an
accent and is deadly with a sword.

the lands as one of the most rich. It is controlled by a king and queen but
through their protection do most of the nobles of the kingdom flourish. They
are allowed to do almost anything they want which stimulates a lot of growth
and brings a lot of wealth into area. Merchants and high nobles from around the
land are always sure to stop here first if they're traveling nearby.

&nA &+w&+LBedroom&n lined with &+L&+LSilky &nWall Hangings&n~
   This is obviously a guest bedroom. A carpet lays at the foot of a bed.
The bed has been specially designed and constructed by the lord of the manor in
order to make a great impression on would be visitors. These guests are
no doubt of high social standing within the kingdom. A picture of the King of
Valois hangs on the wall opposite of the bed. It was once suspected that plots
have been arranged by this lord in order to deter the populous from following
the king so loyally. These rumors have not escaped that castle gates. It is
rumored from within that this lord has not reframed from using other methods
to ruin any potential rivals for the heir to the thrown.

&nA &+b&+LCircular Fountain&n in a &+gLush Courtyard&n~
   The courtyard of the Oakencrest Mansion contains some of the most exotic
plants found anywhere in Valois. Massive bushes line the low wall which
encircles the courtyard, their thick branches adding an extra layer of
defense against spying eyes. Several different trees have been planted here,
adding their lush green color and scent to the other growths. Few flowers
can be seen, but those that are visible appear to have been chosen for their
unusual and sturdy appearance. A path leads northwards, towards the mansion.
Half way there it separates, as it traces its way around a circular fountain
in the courtyard's center. An endless spray of water erupts from a stone
eagle located in the fountain.

The &+LEntrance&n to the &+gOakencrest Mansion~
   The vaulted entryway into the Oakencrest Mansion is is quite large,
stretching well over fifty feet across. Several different hallways stretch
in every direction, leading towards different parts of the mansion. The floor
here is covered with simple tiles, decorated with a pattern of dark hunter
green and white diamonds. Several tapestries hang from the walls, accenting
the floor with their green dies and golden borders. The occasional portrait of
an Oakencrest family member can be seen hanging from the walls, usually a
memorial to someone who has fallen with honor in battle.

&nA Room&n lined with &+rItems of War&n~
   Weapons and armor of varying origins decorate the walls. Some is much too
old to be of any use, having been forged thousands of years ago. The
collection seems to honor battle, though in a way that doesn't support
unnecessary violence or bloodshed. Several paintings and tapestries hang
between the monuments of battle, each depicting knights and rangers in
their greatest glory. The other decor is quite plain, consisting of a few
potted plants and emerald curtains. This is to keep the weapons and armor a
focus of the room. The floor is polished and crafted of a dark hardwood. Its
surface reflects the glow of several lamps which hang from brass holders
attached to the walls.&n

&nA Rectangular &+gDining&n Area&n~
   The dining room stretches about a hundred feet in length, providing enough
room for crowds of people to feast without much difficulty. One massive table
stretches the length of this room, its surface covered with a fine white table
cloth and platinum candle holders. High backed wooden chairs provide the only
seats within the room, each one positioned evenly around the table. A
crackling stone fireplace has been inserted in the northern wall, providing
heat and a bit of light.

&nA &+w&+LKitchen&n in the &+gOakencrest Mansion&n~
   A large wooden table takes up most of the kitchen, providing the servants
with only a small amount of room to travel through. The northern wall is
dominated by a huge cooking hearth, which roars with a crackling flame.
The heat from this hearth is powerful, warming the whole kitchen to
uncomfortable levels. Pots and pans dangle from the ceiling, in easy reach of
those assigned to work here. A small trapdoor can be seen in to floor, which
leads to a cramped pantry. Milk, cheese, and fruits are held within the pantry
until needed, preventing them from spoiling too quickly.

&nA Solid &+gWooden&n Stairway&n~
   This wooden staircase leads up to the second floor of the Oakencrest
mansion. Its solid frame is quite impressive, probably designed by one of the
more famous carpenters within Valois. A thick railing leads the way up to the
second floor, preventing anyone frame falling to their death. Several small
paintings hang from the walls here, each one of a passed member of the
Oakencrest family. Oakencrest is a valuable general. He is like a brother to the
king and is treated as such. His advice is valuable and his patronage even so.

   A deep hunter green rug runs along the wooden floor throughout this hallway,
creating an effect similar to thick plush grass. A golden border lines this
rug, defining a line between the dark green of the carpet and brilliant yellow
of the light wooden floor below. Several small tables have been placed along
this hallway, some holding vases and other artifacts while others being bare,
except for a simple cloth. The occasional window allows a slight breeze to
enter, carrying the scent of fresh plants from the courtyard outside.

&nA &+L&+LWalled&+r Sparring Field~
   This is land east of the massive courtyard that has been cleared of all its
foliage, leaving only a bear field for sparring in. The walls are higher here
giving even more privacy for those working out or practicing their skills
within the field. The Oakencest family is known as one of the leaders of the
Valoisian Rangers, an orginization geared towards providing protection and
information to the royal family. There is nothing that one of these Rangers
wouldn't do, including taking an arrow for those under their protection.
Because of this, the Oakencrest family spends much of its time preparing for
combat.

   Maps of Valois and the surrounding area hangs from the walls, some of
which are detailed to perfection. Shelves of books line the remaining wall
space, their space taken up to capacity with volumes on warfare and topics
related to subterfuge. A massive table has been placed in the very center of
the study, its surface containing a map of the whole realm. It is obvious
this is used for plotting out Valois's military deployment strategies, as
several key points have been marked with little green pins.&n

lined with a golden trim. A massive king sized bed takes up most of the
northern wall, its sides flanked by two oak dressers. Thick green linen drapes
across the bed's surface, providing protection during the coldest of Valoisian
nights. An ancient sword hangs from the northern wall, its keen blade glowing
with a soft bluish light.

   This balcony is rather large, capable of holding almost a dozen men without
becoming too crowded. The railings are carved with delicate skill, little
leaves of ivy engraved into the dark wood. Several chairs are scattered about
the tiled balcony, allowing the Oakencrest family to enjoy the view of Valois,
when they're not busy with military training. The glass top of a small table
holds a huge picture, and several mugs. This vantage point provides an
excellent view of the city, including all of Imperial Road and some of the
western section of the commerce sector.

&+BBren's &+LWeapon Shop~
   Few citizens of Valois have what it takes to master the art of forging
weapons. The process of becoming a forger starts at an early age as an
apprentice and clerk. It usually takes years of practice in order for a student
to be hired for his skills, even then it is difficult to forge weapons alone.
It takes the bulk of two ordinary male citizens to carry in what would take
only one forger to carry. Aside from years of experience, it takes many years
to harden oneself to the blazing heat that a forge must work in. Display cases
have been set up along the walls and within the counter. Everything from
daggers to two-handed battle axes can be found here. Behind the counter a door
forbids access to another section of the shop, the forge.

&+rGarbleyarble's Shop&n of &+gThis &nand &+cThat~
   A large pole made of iron shoots toward the ceiling in the middle of the
room. The pole was a strong iron one, however, it's rusted. Garbleyarble must
have had some problems with his roofing as of late for it is obvious since the
pole meets up with a support beem that upholds the roof. Drafts of planned
machines and gadgets can be found almost anyplace, on top of counters, pinned
to the wall, pinned to the ceiling, laying on the floor, and stapled upon his
own forhead. The wooden floor creaks of old age. Sounds of machinery are
audible, however, they come from within the back room of the general store, a
place where it is off limits to everyone but Garbleyarble himself. A window or
two have been shattered, however, there is no glass on the floor.

glass windows in the western wall looks out to the road that runs along the
bakery's entrance, providing a great deal of sunshine during the later hours
of the day while the sun is setting. A few simple lamps have been attatched to
the whitewashed walls, providing illumination during the early mornings when
the bakery first opens. Several tables and baskets are scattered around the
room, each holding a wide assortment of baked goods. To the east, massive stone
baking hearths can be seen, each providing enough room to bake dozens of bread
loaves.&n

Outside the &+LMassive Castle &+mGates~
   This castle houses some of the richest and most powerful people within the
kingdom and outside of it. It is the diplomatic center in which all of the
races of the world have agreed to meet to discuss their future with each other.
Finely carved stones and bricks have been used to construct the walls that
surround the castle. There are parapets above the two massive double doors.
These parapets protect the castle and are manned at all times. The archers on
top of them shoot down any threat within the immediate area. It is rumored that
the doors have only opened for those who have a high social status, such as a
rich noble of the land. Everyone else has to use the secondary gate which is
much smaller than this one. That gate can not fit large caravans or anything
of that nature through. It is a much smaller gate fitted as a service entrance.
Once a party has entered the castle they are immediately searched and disarmed.

much but it is the only road leading to the great Voloisian castle.

   This road leads to the great castle Valois. Valois is the greatest castle in
all the lands. It is the meeting place of all of the races of the world. They
discuss matters of the state and trade. It is the one place that all the races
can come together to discuss their interests. It is also one of the most secure
castles in all of the land and boasts an army greater than most. The elves
enjoy this great castle and the many luxuries it affords. The dwarven nation
marvels at the design of this castle and the architecture within. The humans
don't pay much attention to the king or the castle but are resolved to work out
their own interests. The barbarians enjoy the celebrations and the food that
the great castle serves. Ulgris, the king of the castle, has an estate larger
than most provinces. He has a royal line of retainers that are powerful in
their own ways and just as rich and powerful. The great king relies on their
expertise and their loyalty. Having great retainers makes a great king. This
cobblestone road was built years ago when the castle was first built. It isn't
much but it is the only road leading to the great Voloisian castle.

Before a &+ySm&+Lal&+yl Mo&+La&+yt~
   This moat protects the castle from invaders. It stops an approaching army
in its tracks and prevents them from using their heavy machines to launch an
assault against the castle gates. It was learned by the kings predecessors
that the machines of war can quickly demolish walls and gates. Since that time
a lot of money has been invested into building this moat. The water was
channeled from the nearby sea to the east. The sea provides the kingdom with
wealth and influence from trade. The king would even like to setup an armada
of ships. Merchants, dealers, and visitors from afar reach Valois from these
docks. Protecting them and the king is of the highest priority, and the moat
around the castle was spared no expense. Some of the benefactors contributing
to the construction of the moat are from the elven and dwarven kingdom. The
kings retainers planned for months and months before beginning the project,
which took over three years. Bandits from afar used this opportunity to strike
at the wealth of the kingdom, and they were quietly caught and dealt with.

A &+LGua&+yrd&+L St&+yat&+Li&+yon~
   This is the huge iron gate leading toward the great castle of Valois.
Its huge iron frame is dotted with dull knobs to enforce it against battering
rams and lesser assaults. The hinges are secured deep into the brick wall with
thick metal bolts. Huge timbers lean against the wall, used to block the gate
if the kingdom is ever invaded. Two small towers flank the gate, each one
housing a single guard. These provide a constant watch for invaders. Guards
man these gates at all times during the day and night. Intruders have been
caught before trying to sneak their way into the area. Ruffians and shady
people are turned away from the castle. The road continues to the east and
runs toward the massive castle to the north. The castle Valois is protected
at all times with massive forces. It is said to have a large armed force
protecting the gates at all times and even a deadlier squad of warriors inside
warding against assassins. The wind creates a whining sound.

A Winding &+yCo&+Lb&+yb&+Ll&+yes&+Lt&+yo&+Ln&+ye Road~
   This road leads straight to the castle of Valois. It is surrounded on all
sides by fields of grass. The grass grows tall and is very green. There are
many birds in flying overhead. The forests to the south are home to some of
the most exotic plants and animals in all of the world. The Valoisians are
a rich people full of rich dreams. They cultivate the land in the surrounding
area for crops and other resources, such as gold and timber. Their city is at
the center of great trade and has a great tactical advantage at war. The high
castle walls of Valois have withstood countless attacks by bands of militants
and barbarians. The high king that sits on its thrown is endowed with the
responsibility of the kingdom's welfare. The king has many enemies but many
more powerful friends. Merchants travel from afar to do business within the
castle walls. The kings powerful retainers do much for the city's welfare,
such as providing troops and arms in time of need. The tall castle walls can
be seen from here to the north. The wind blows, making a whining sound.

Before an &+yO&+Lld&+y Ta&+Lve&+yrn~
   This road is made of old cobblestones and needs to be repaired. The stones
have been here awhile and not been cared for. Weeds and other ferns are
slowly overtaking the road. The tall plains of grass on either side run great
distances before meeting trees or rolling foothills. The foothills are home
to the roaming nomads. These nomads live in tribes and are fiercely protective
of their own. They believe in family, and family means no one gets left
behind or forgotten. To the world they are outsiders, but to them the world is
just the opposite. None one can understand their ways unless they've lived
among them. A nomad life is survivable only if all nomads stick together. The
kingdom of Valois reaches far and wide, but doesn't assert any authority over
the wandering nomads. King Ulgris is a wise and powerful ruler, he is just
and treats everyone with respect. The nomadic people live under his protection
still and it is rumored that he has laid a pact down with them sealed in blood.

An &+yOl&+Ld T&+yav&+Le&+yrn~
   This tavern has been here for quite some time. It was built along with
other temples and businesses a long time ago when the kingdom was first born.
It was owned by one of the king's retainers but sold. The new owner didn't
take a liking to the business so he employed a manager and gave him a meager
salary to run the place. The place looks run down and not been cared for.
There are old stains on the floor and a small odor. There are a few chairs
missing legs and some very few tables left standing. Perhaps there were a lot
of fights in this pub. The bartender goes about his day solemnly. Despite the
location there aren't a great deal of customers who come here. The king has
even considered closing the place down because it is unsightly and everyone
who visits the kingdom must pass by this place first. This pub has seen better
days. The only exit is to the south. The cooks kitchen is behind the counter.

Over a &+yDr&+Law&+yb&+Lri&+ydge~
   The dwarves themselves designed this drawbridge for the kingdom of Valois.
It is perfect in its design and was easily added to the already existing
castle gates, which is a marvel. It took dwarven engineers months to design
the drawbridge and a year to finalize the project. On an ordinary day it is
lowered but when danger lurks this drawbridge raises and gives an added
advantage to an already impregnable castle. The king is very proud of this
technological achievement and very rarely orders it raised. It is marveled
at by everyone. The fine bronze, iron, steel, and copper metals have been
polished to shine and give this bridge the stability it needs. The banner of
the kingdom flies overhead, an eagle lurching with its talons flashing
and wings spread. The moat surrounding the castle is sure to stop an enemy
army in its tracks, giving the archers on the top of the walls time to fire
their arrows. The wind blows and it feels good.

A &+gPlain&n of &+gGrass~
   The tall green grass grows abundantly here. The kingdom of Valois stretches
far and wide. Its influence can be felt nearly everywhere within the
surrounding countryside. The king favors the people of this land and endows
the most bright and brilliant with grants in hopes that they might attain
wealth of their own and succeed. King Ulgris is a brilliant ruler surrounded
by powerful friends. He realizes his vulnerabilities and strengths and
tries to offset them with powerful people and a happy nation. A strength of a
nation is defined by the loyalty to the sovereignty in the king's mind, which
is why is he generous and fair to all the people in the kingdom. Small houses
and farms surround the countryside and the king affords them with protection
in return for support in times of need. The kingdom of Valois is powerful.

A Narrow &+yDusty Road~
   On either side of the road grass grows abundantly. It is very tall and very
green. The wind brushes it from side to side. The plains of grass continue
for miles in all directions before rolling into foothills. Trees outline the
horizon on either side of the road, there plush green leaves a sign that this
land is fertile. A tall watchtower can be seen to the northeast, alongside a
winding cobblestone road. It is no doubt some sort of outpost for the castle
of Valois, which is further to the north. The kingdom of Valois can be felt
far and wide in this area. It reaches great distances and has great influence.
It barters goods and controls any number of trade routes in the area. It
benefits from a great location that its founders were sure of. The great castle
of Valois was only just recently built compared to the lifespan of the
kingdom. It was first a settlement of farmers which grew further into a trade
town, which eventually lead to riches beyond the original settlers dreams. This
winding road continues north and south.

The Rolling &+yFoothills~
   The rolling foothills continue westward. They never seem to end. Trees and
tall grass cover the countryside. The settlers here have no fear of wandering
beasts of unruly nomads, for they are both kept in check by the power of the
kings armies. The nomads of the plains are not a vigilant people, but they
are fierce. It is said that an understanding between the king and the
wandering nomadic tribes of the plains has been reached, they refuse to be
ruled and in turn the king will not try to subdue them. This is an accord
that has been kept for years and works quite well. The nomads of the plains
have no problem with the settlers and they have even traded amongst one
another. The farmers here develop the land and in turn sell their crops to
the nomads to feed their families. The king also buys from the farmers for
his armies and for his own trading purposes. The elves and dwarves are said
to pay a handsome prices for an ear of corn or a bag of barley.

A &+ySmall Settlement~
   The settlers who live here develop the land for food and sell their surplus
to the king and the nomads. The king pays handsomely for the goods and the
nomads usually barter what they can. The settlers enjoy this arrangement
since they end up having both money and useful tools and clothing. The nomads
are a mysterious people who are neither to be trifled with or underestimated.
They are highly intelligent and fierce warriors. They wander the plains in
tribes or fierce bands to hunt for food and clothing. Often times they only
remain in one spot for a few days or maybe a couple of weeks. They are often
feared among the people of the kingdom but not by the settlers here. These
settlers are a hardy bunch of people used to rigorous choirs and duties, much
like the nomadic lifestyle. Perhaps this is why they became accustomed to
the countryside and all of its surrounding beasts and warrior tribes.

   The brick road is neatly constructed and is very fine. The brick was
chiseled by master workmen. They fit evenly next to one another and are almost
seamless. This is impressive workmanship only fit for the finest of roads.
The brick was stained the color red and the road spans a good twenty feet
wide. It runs northeastward toward the great castle of Valois, and the castle
walls can be seen from this distance. A few shouts can be heard from here from
guards on top of the castle walls. These guards are expert archers with uncanny
marksmanship. They have been trained in the arts of war and have been masters,
just like most of the Valoisian guard, for many years. It takes years of
practice and studying to be admitted into the world's richest and most powerful
army. It does not discriminate against anyone, but it only accepts those truly
committed. All sons of Valois are honored to be dressed in warrior garb under
the kingdoms banner. It is considered a time honored privilege to serve the
king and country. The road continues northeast toward the castle.
