&+rEntran&+Rce to an Anc&+rient Temple&N~
&+L   The entrance to t&+whis ancient temple seems &+Lto have long since been forgotton,
&+Las lots of debris and cru&+wmbled stone litter the fl&+Loor. A huge set of &+ydouble
&+ydoors&+L in the north wall has be&+wen heavily barricaded, ob&+Lviously to deter anyone
&+Lfoolish enough to have come this fa&+wr from going any further.&+L A &+rseal&+L of some
&+Lsort can be seen embedded in the door, a&+wnd a &+Wlarge sign&+w attracts &+Lthe attention
&+Lof anyone entering this room.

&+wThrough the pitch black darkness, t&+Lhe form of a trapdoor can&+w barely be

&+bA Wide Hallway Etched From &+LStone~
&+b   Dust and tiny particles of flesh from long since rotted corpses fills the
&+Lair here, creating sort of a haze which fills this wide hallway. The stench of
&+bdeath and decayed flesh creates an almost intolerable reek, so strong it
&+Lalmost knocks you on your ass as you wander among the hall. The hallway itself
&+bis quite wide, permitting easy traveling throughout the temple, carved out of
&+Lthe hard stone underground. The wide hallway continues east and west, while a
&+bcramped passage can be seen to the north.

&+cA Long, &+CDark Hallway~
&+L   No torches adorn this long hallway within the temple, leaving it in complete
&+Ldarkness. The rough stone walls are cold to the touch, and the sounds of bone
&+Lcracking beneath your feet can be heard as you walk along the hall. Many
&+Ldifferent daggers, stilletos, and other blades can be seen painted on the
&+Lwalls in this part of the hallway, faded after all these years. This long, dark
&+Lhallway continues north and south.

to be a meeting hall for the &+cRoya&+Cl G&+cuards&N of the realm. These &+Cg&+cuards&N served
to protect the &+bKing&N, the &+YQueen&N, and any other members of the &+croya&+Ll&N family.
These barracks were placed very close to the kings living quarters to provide
the most protection incase of any assualt against him. From this room, the
guards could quickly assemble and smite any foes that dare attack. Some cots
can be seen to the south, a small kitched to the north, and what looks like a
training room is east.

hungry. Cabinets line the walls, at one time probably filled with many kinds
of food, all long since eaten by rats and other vermin. The meeting hall lies

filled with jewels of all natures. &+BGems&N, &+gem&+Ger&+gal&+Gds&N, &+Rrubies&N, &+Wdia&+Cmo&+Wnds&N, not only
in their natural form, but also in the shape of rings, necklaces, and

The king obviously took pride in the elegant equipment his armies have gathered
over the years, along with that which he inherited. Every weapon in this room
is fit for a king, with their handles set with gems of every nature, and their
blades fashioned of unbreakable steel. The armor on the otherhand, doesnt look
like it could protect anyone from even a dull knife, let alone a real weapon,
however the jewelry adorning it makes it a feast for the eyes. More of the
treasure room lies east.

&+LThe Counting Table&N~
   Stacks of &+Ygold&N, &+Csilver&N, &+ycopper&N, and &+Wplatinum&N cover a large wooden table,
which takes up a great deal of this room. Here, the &+Bking&N could come to count
his millions in privacy, without his nagging wife looking over his shoulder.
What this room lacks is the brilliance of the rest of the treasure room, as
all that mattered here was adding up just how much the &+Bking&N was worth.

tome journal~
I met with Zynar the other day, hopefully soon we will be able to gather enough
help to overrun these infernal mages and undead hordes. A few others have
managed to avoid detection, and have agreed to aid our cause. I agreed to
make them some magical items in order to entice them to help. I feel that,
with the help of some magical gear, a small band of brave souls could do
significant harm to the mages, maybe even destroying them all. Once the mages
fall, the undead will have no order, and will be easy to finish off.
Unfortunately, I am unable to wander the halls safely, and am thus unable to
find the necessary parts needed to create these magical items.
If I can manage to gather any like items, I feel my skill is such that I will
be able to merge them into a much more powerful combination of the items.
Also, if I can find where the King hid his magical orb, I can greatly enhance
the attributes of almost any object.
I am led to believe that the King will have hid his orb amongst the other
treasures in his teasure room, and the only way into there is with a magical
elemental key, which requires a shard from each element, as well as a pure
glass key to make.

A Barren Room~
   This room is compeletly devoid of anything material. Cobwebs hanging all
over room hint that no one has been in here in a Very long time. The walls
are remarkably smooth, and also very cold to the touch. Two doors lead out of
this room, with a four-leaf clover etched in the northern door, and two hands
clasped together in the southern door.

&+WThe High Altar~
 &+L  In this middle of this very small room rests a &+Whigh altar&+L, carved from the
&+wfine&+Wst ma&+wrble&+L, studded with &+Gemeralds&+L, &+Bgems&+L, and many other &+Yjewels&+L. The
&+Csp&+War&+Ckl&+Win&+Cg&+L from the &+Yjewels&+L sends light bouncing around the room, creating an
&+Lalmost-disco effect. A swirling &+Car&+Br&+cay &+Yof &+cli&+Bg&+Chts&+L reflecting on the ceiling seems
&+Lto beckon you.
