   This place leaves one with the notion that efreeti don't think too
highly of other Genie kind.  A dead dao hangs from a sign outside
and several stuff genie of all sorts, djinn, madraid, dao etc. line the
walls of this place.  A number of efreeti seem to hang out here, thus
one gets the feeling that few are offended by the decor.

from them even though they are glowing as if they are lite. A small
display case is located on the north and west wall and a stand alone one
is in the opposite corner containing the different treats sold here.

&+yIntersection of Merchants Street and Street of Steale~
The streets are constructed in a cobblestone pattern but made of
some redish tint marble. Lights line the streets in lanterns that
hover over the walkways and glow yellow with a magical hue. The
intersection turns to the south here as it melds with the Merchants
Street. The northwest tower entrance of the city is to the north
from here and the city wall blocks any further movement west.

By far the busiest section of the Street of Steale as it intersects
with the harbor. Many of the city's goods are transported through
the docks and moved to the nearby markets. The city wall is to the
north and to the south the street narrows just a little as forms
the Brass Harbor way. The street of Steale continues out of sight to
both the east and west of here.

have no need for the more common ship equipment. The owner of the shop has

is definitely where the music was coming from. There is a Satyr who is
skipping around in an undefined pattern playing various instruments
keeping those who are interested entertained. He has a small circular
tent set up in what would be considered the center of the bazaar with
many instruments that are made of mostly medals or of some speciality
woods.

maintained and are currently all in use for the day.

A very dusty and not well travelled corner of the bazaar is tucked away
in the corner here. Just a single being resides here, the construct
called "the repair man". Flakes of its flesh forms layers upon layers of
dust as it stands motionless until needed. Several vacant shops are
adjacent nearby as their inhabitents probably found it a bit creepy as
did the bazaar traffic since not many visit here.

&+yThe Slave Market~
This area is filled with cages of all different sizes around the
edges of the room and poles in the center with shackles attached.
The smell is rancid likely from all the sweat and hygene of the
humanoids that visit here. Only relief is the open air from above
but is stale in such a hot place. The slave market continues on
to the north and west.

with some flaming liquid that continue between the two connecting rooms.
There is a well marked path in the middle of the room leading from one
to the next made of redish orange cobblestone. To the west it looks as
if the room is on fire. Back to the north is the entrance.

This room is emaculate and contains just 1 singular object which is
located in the center of the room, a flame. The flame comes right out
of the floor by some magical means. It is not consuming any sort of
fuel source that you can tell with a closer look and is giving off no
heat or smoke. The wall and floors are made of a mirror like surface
reflecting the light from the flame casting shadows of anyone who enters
the room.

building of the palace can be seen far to the north but an
imposing wall seperates you from it. Above, the flaming sky
can be seen with ease in this open space.

&+yArtoon's Room~
This immense room obviously belongs to a god, at least that is the
impression anyone would get from walking into here. Huge flaming
columns of purple and blue flames run well over one hundred feet
from floor to ceiling and an air of energy can be felt everywhere
in here. The floor is of polished brass and there is a huge rounded
window overlooking the courtyard and fountains. The ceiling has
various paintings on it, depicting all sorts of efreeti activities.
These seem far less warlike than those enchanted elsewhere in the
palace. A bejeweled throne is in the far eastern part of the room.

pile of fiery pillows to go along with it. A mirrored wall allows
the Padashaw to gaze upon himself at will. There is a huge glowing
brass chest in the corner and a dresser in another.
Several paintings hang on the walls...obviously not your normal
sort of paintings. The depict the Padashaw in various acts of battle,
love making and pageantry.

&+yThe Harem~
Several pillows of flame are all about the floor, in fact on closer
inspection the floor intself is made up of several pillow-like mats
or other similar material. There are small rooms inside this one,
where the ladies must live when they are not attending to the needs
of the royal family. All sorts of love-making paraphernalia lies
around in here, none of which looks usable by humans. A small
fountain is in the center of this two hundred plus foot room.

&+yA Grand Hallway~
This hallway is FAR larger then the ones on the lower lever. It has
huge supporting columns all along its length, no windows can be seen
here, and the floor takes on a pure brass nature. The hall runs in
two directions here and seems to be lit from a natural light source
that is set into the walls themselves.

foot chests at the end of each. There are three different weapon racks
loaded with several different pole arms. The north exit is the only way
out of this room and leads back to the stairway.

found leading upward. There is a well adorned archway marking the
stairway that has a symbol of two hands pressed together at their
palms. The hallway heads west from here and is well lit by the many

These stairs come to an end here on this landing and continue their
direction up and down the tower across the room. On the western wall
of the room is a red marble-like door leading into the Grand Library.

&+yThe Tower of Prayer~
You go through a large archway here at the top of the stairs and come
into a huge domed room some three hundred feet high. Glowing spinning
globs of fire in a multitude of colors float in the air at different
leves. Efreet holy symbols are etched in flame on the walls here, and
far up in the domed ceiling there is a somewhat clear glass-like
substance that gives off a rainbow of light. An archway can be seen
to the south and a small flight of stairs beyond that.

&+yThe Main Meditation Room~
This looks like some sort of meditation or prayer room used by
efreeti clerics. A small altar is set into the south wall, and
strange symbols can be seen upon it. Several huge pews are setup
along the west wall and the air is heavy with the smell of
burning incense.

&+yThe High Priests Chamber~
The high priest of all Efreeti lives in this room, a magnificent throne
is here with a crest of flame behind it. Several smaller chairs are set
up in front of the throne and the never ending gaze of Kossuth looks down
at all who enter from above the mighty throne. The room slopes upwards
to the north, and shooting flames can be seen in that direction from time
to time. Strange books seem to float in the air, opening and closing by
themselves. More floating globs of various colors dance here and there
around the room, giving off a rainbow of light.

&+yTop of the Tower of Prayer~
This huge domed room is some five hundred feet in diameter. The
ceiling is about one hundred feet high and a huge statue of Kossuth
the tyrant king, supreme ruler of the Elemental Plane of Fire is
protruding out of the north wall. The statue is immersed in living
flames and the eyes seem to have a life like quality to them. A huge
glowing window sets in the far eastern wall spewing forth fire every
then seconds covering the room in fire.

What seems like an endless hallway runs to the west here as well
but this time it branches to the north and south. The ceiling is
some fifty feet or more overhead with a curved shape to it. Red
marble or a marble like substance composes the floor of this hall,
and several murals line the walls. Every so often an arched window,
too high for a human to see out of, is here along the walls and
glowing braziers of bright orange fire are set into the walls.

practice dummies of enormous size. Strange looking devices that
float in and about the room darting here and there seem to move with
a will of their own. Huge benches and tables are also here with
chairs, mats and other items that depict this as some sort of lounge
or training room used by the Efreeti warriors.

unsuitable for the efreeti. An armoire is mounted against the southern wall
completing the decore of the room.

are hundreds of feet high and each are carved and look to be made of solid
brass forming an enormous archway. The floor has some sort of rug that goes
from door to door and you are sure it is made of magma as it is moving with
an uneasy motion. North is a double door leading into the main throne room
and to the south leads into a great hallway.
