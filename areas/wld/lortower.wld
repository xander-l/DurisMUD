&+L    And join the Star of Darkness together. The five shall be gathered

&+L    of Light. Together you shall free our lord, the Master of Shadows,

&+L    be dominion over the world, those that side with the Master shall
&+L    live, those that do not shall have their hearts eaten out.&n


&+L    But Beware my children of Darkness!! BEWARE! The goddess of Light
&+L    does not die quickly or easily! She shall try and destroy me as
&+L    we are at our strongest! Heroes will come, possibly ones that walk
&+L    in the Day, maybe heroes of darkness, I cannot see, the goddess

&+Lfive seating places scattered equidistantly around the table. The gouges
&+Lare all colored in red, making them seem like large runes of some sort. Every

&+y   The old stone road comes to an end here. To the north is the center of a

&+ythis small village. It seems that only the main merchants live in the town,
&+yall the rest of the town's occupants live in their respective farmhouses.
&+yAlso in the distance to the north west there seems to be a small church that

&n   The books that lie out on the table deal with an odd sort of reanimation
process. It seems to be a mixture between golem creation and undead animation.
The process is only half-way finished and it seems that someone was working
on some loose leaf paper the rest of the forumla. It seems to deal with
calling the soul back from the underworld, and making it possess a created
body of some sort... also some words such as "Zrack" and "Maltheas" are
scribed along the notes as well.

&+CA &n&+rWar &+Cof &+WLight &+CAnd &+LDarkness&n~
&n   Here, in the center of these two planes, is a very strange thing indeed.
Here is a large &+Cp&+Bo&n&+br&+Bt&+Ca&+Wl &nto somewhere else in the planes. From it flows a
torrent of &+Ldarkness &nand &+Lnight&n. The two seem to be colliding here, creating
massive &n&+mmagical &n&+rexplosions&n all about. It is as if &+Wp&+Co&+Bs&n&+bit&+Bi&+Cv&+We &nand &+Lnegative
&+Cenergy &nare in collision here, and in so doing are creating a monumental
&n&+rexplosion &nof &+Cenergy&n. A &n&+mglobe &nof &n&+rred &+Clight &nextends around the two forces and
seems to absorb all the power that is exchanged between to two. It then
funnels it down toward the &+Cbarrier &nof &+Bmagic&n that is below.&n

&+LThe A&n&+rbys&+Ls&n~
&+L   This is the place of nightmares. The small area on which this mountain
&+Lsits is between two very differant areas. To the west is the &n&+rDemon &+LPr&nin&+Cc&+We
&n&+rOrcus's &+Lhome level. From here the huge M&+Ra&n&+rz&+Re&+L of Night&n&+rmares &+Lextends out into
&+Lthe distance. The massive mountains seem to reach up past the sky themsleves,
&+Lin an effort to make the traveling of its deep valleys a requirement. To the
&+Least is the home plane of Sargon. From here it looks like almost nothing is
&+Lin that direction, simply a black sky that keeps getting blacker, but a few
&+Lthings can be made out in that direction. Only a fool would go either of those
&+Lways though. To the north, between the two areas is a small open area of a
&ncave &+Lthat expands before you. It seems to be slightly on the Sargon area.&n

&+Gto the north. The huge mouth of the cavern is carved in the shape of a huge
&+Wskull&n&+G, with the entrance its large mouth. A &n&+ggreenish &n&+mglow &+Gprojects out of the
&+Geyes of the skull itself, barely illuminating the area.&n

&+yThe shelves are lined with various books and tomes that seem to have to do
