&+LA Fissure in the Earth&n~
&+L   Streams of light filter down past the thick dust that arises from the dark&n
&+Ldepths of this crack in the face of the earth.  Shuffling stones can be heard&n
&+Lechoing across the jagged edges of this vertical shaft, most likely created&n
&+Lby some intense earthquake.  The shaft progresses downward into the depths&n
&+Lof this earth, a path away from the blue sky above to the darkness below.&n

&+LA Fissure in the Earth&n~
&+L   The sky above and its rays of light make themselves less prevalent as the&n
&+Ljagged protrusions of rock and the rising dust make themselves more and&n
&+Lmore present. These stone juts however, provide the only foothold available,&n
&+Land they seem to follow the sky's pattern of abundance.  Indeed, they&n
&+Lthemselves slowly disappear as this underground cave races downwards into the&n
&+Ldark.&n

&+LA Fissure in the Earth&n~
&+L   Strangely enough, the stone footholds that this shaft had provided higher&n
&+Lup have been completely shaven off.  Why or how this has been done is not quite&n
&+Lexactly clear, but considering the manual labour it must have taken, there&n
&+Lmust surely be a good reason.  From here and downward on, this tunnel offers&n
&+Lno grip, no light, and even less hope.  Moreover, a humanoid &nskull&+L bolted&n
&+Lonto the wall discourages further travel.&n

&+LA Polished Tunnel of Stone&n~
&+L   The sky is now but a faint speck of light high above, reflected here as a&n
&+Lmillion small white dots making for a night sky tapestry on these polished&n
&+Lwalls of cold stone.  A weak current of warm air rises from below, carrying&n
&+Lwith it stenches that have no name to qualify them, lest death not&n
&+Lcharacterise it well enough.  Still no light below, this tunnel continues&n
&+Lits seemingly endless course downward into this void enclosed in stone.&n

&+bAt the Bottom of the Stone Tunnel~
&+L   The tunnel comes to an end here,  the light from above now totally gone.&n
&+LThe floor here is soft, most likely composed of some lightly packed soil.&n
&+LThere are finger marks shaven into the walls around, and were they able&n
&+Lto speak they would surely tell of great agony and torment, how long it&n
&+Lmust have taken for these digits to sign their fates into stone!  There&n
&+Lis an small opening to the south, again heading into nothing but darkness.&n

&+bIn a Cavern of Damp Stone&n~
&+L   The air is much cooler here, and through the terrible smells of decay&n
&+Lfresh currents of air manage to waft through.  This tunnel becomes&n
&+Lprogressively wider, and eventually gives onto a larger cavern area to the&n
&+Limmediate south.  A strange collection of crucifix can be seen&+G glowing&+L in the&n
&+Ldistance.  Their mass reminding fate of its cruelty and forever tormenting&n
&+Ltheir cause by their relentless phosphorescence.&n

&+LA Passage Chiselled in Stone~
&+L   This cubic passage, having perhaps a ten foot width, is wholly chiselled&n
&+Lfrom the surrounding stone.  Ceramic tiles have been lain artistically on the&n
&+Lfloor, the greater image depicting an angel with three eyes.  Whatever its&n
&+Lmeaning, it is disturbing considering religious dogma and the thought that&n
&+Lmust have gone behind this aberrate saint's profile.&n

&+LA Passage Chiselled in Stone~
&+L  The small decorative ceramic tiles have given way to a set of perfectly&n
&+Lspread stone tiles.  Triangular in shape, old and laden with dust, they must&n
&+Lhave once made for a grand entrance - or exit for any matter.  In some areas&n
&+Ltheir polish hasn't faded, and the lustre within those few unscarred tiles&n
&+Lis incredible.  There are &+cpainted runes&+L scribed all over the walls and&n
&+Lceiling.  The intricacy of their alphabet is truly remarkable, there is&n
&+Lbarely any redundancy in the near three or four thousand characters painted&n
&+Lhere.  Strange that the paint would endure this long though.&n

&+CBefore a &+GWond&+gerous &+BVa&+ble~
&+B   Standing upon some skyborne perch in what seems to be some artificial&n
&+Becosystem, a surreal view of a &+Ysun&+Glit vale&+B unfolds about.  Downwards&n
&+Bfrom the ledge lay none more than a four or five hundred league drop,&n
&+Bsave for a violent downwards stream that heads onto a lake on a floating
&+Bring-shaped section of land&+B.  Your eyes indeed do not lie, there is a
&+Bsuspended oval of &+yearth&+B, and&n &+Btwo of the same superposed one above
&+Bthe other at a fairly spaced interval.&n
   &+BThese three rings show no obvious signs of how they are positioned so, yet&n
&+Btheir authenticity is verified by the &+Gfoliage a&+gnd wildlife&+B that live upon them.&n
&+BRoots&+B protrude downwards from the underside of these magical flats, and&n
&+Bwater drips from a topmost pond; itself fed by a steady stream of water from&n
&+Babove, and downwards thereon from level to level forming a makeshift &+Bwaterfall&n
&+Bthat echoes loudly about the vale - itself emptying into some deep lake in&n
&+Bthe center of it.  There is an astounding &+Ggreenery&+B here, and an&n
&+Bincomparable array of wildlife living within.  All this, from this minuscule&n
&+Bledge in the sky, make for the most awe inspiring sight ever. &n

&+bbit to the east, and its repercussions can wholly be felt in the stirred&n
&+bcurrents that torment this lake.  Branches and leaves are swallowed whole&n
&+band sucked downwards in certain parts of the lake.  No exacting pattern is&n
&+breadily discernible, yet the presence of this demonic undertow is obvious.&n

&nOn a Beach of &+LPebbles~
&+L   The unforgiving waters lie directly to the east, they have seemingly&n
&+Lwashed ashore millions of small rock shards.  Most smoothed with time, they&n
&+Lmust have come from the lining of the stone fissure that feeds this vale&n
&+Lthe fury of this splendid waterfall.  From this standpoint, one can clearly&n
&+Lsee that the waterfall travels from a crack in the ceiling.&n
&+L   It seems that these falls have eroded a lake into this first ring of&n
&+Lfloating soil.  The latter extends both to the northwest and southwest, and is&n
&+Lcharacterised by a lining of jagged-edged stones about its perimeter.  How&n
&+Lthose got there is unfathomable.&n

&nAlong a Beach of&+L Pebbles&n~
   These several thousand stones give way to an earthen plain that spreads
evenly to the northwest.  The soil is covered with long green grass, and
strange stone shapes; most looking like inverted half circles. &+g This makes&n
&+gfor a boggling sight, as everything seems to have some synthetic erosion&n
&+gbrought upon it.  The grass is nonetheless real, as is the sweet breeze that&n
&+gblows gently across one's face.&n

&+g   Though the trees are extremely high, and the foliage quite thick, one can&n
&+gnotice what appears to be a stone structure some ways to the west.  The&n
&+gtrees line the whole northern edge of this disc, and just by the size of their&n
&+gtrunks, along with the length of the weeds and grass, are signs of just how&n
&+glong this place has gone untouched.  It is a marvelous recluse from the&n

   The great circular divide which separates here from the &+Gforest&n lain on the
other side of this punctured disc is directly to the south.  There is a large
stream of &+Cwat&+cer f&+Blow&+Bing&n though it, and an &+rphosphor&+Rescent red&n hue inside the
stream itself.  Travel into this stream is impeded by a series of gigantic
branches.  It is further discouraged by the &+Ggreen &+gsap&n that oozes from the tip
of the latter's thorns.
   The plains extend to the north and east.

&+LA cooking spindle is set in the soil here, and seems used are there is &+rmeat

&+L   This must be the main bedroom, as indicated by the beautiful bed centered&n
&+Lon the shiny scale-like floorpiece.  The bed is rather large, and has several&n
&+Lrunes etched into its dark grained wooden legs.  A large window looks out&n
&+Lonto the plains outside, it offers a wonderful view of the numerous waterfalls&n
&+Lin this vale.  One can also see the outer edge of the second disk, floating&n
&+Lominously below this higher one.  It seems to be less green than this one, in&n
&+Lfact, from the little that can be seen, it seems like the exact opposite.&n
&+LHinted to by a few petrified trees and a dark black soil, it might be a&n
&+Lforeshadowing of what is to come.  From this room, a huge set of doors leads&n
&+Lwestwards onto a small hallway.&n

&+ymassive tree, and unforgivingly take through leaf and branch alike.&n
&+yThrough the green, one can sometimes see the sky pierce through, making for&n
&+ya dancing array of lights on the ground below.  Travel is possible both up&n
&+yand downwards.&n

&+yTravel is impeded most ways thanks to the lot of them.  This massive trunk&n
&+ysecretes some strange cutaneous film of slime, most likely some kind of&n
&+yshield against erosion it could also be some kind of perfume with its&n
&+ypleasant scent.  This massive trunk bifurcates into two smaller principal&n
&+yarteries; one leading straight up, and the other leading northeastwards.&n
&+yWith travel simplified so, one could only get lost in the melodies sung by&n
&+ythe magical birds about.&n

&+yfeet of diameter.  It leads close to a massive &+cwa&+Cte&+Brfall&+y which drops far&n
&+ydownwards onto the platform below.  This gargantuan branch is at this length&n
&+yoverhanging the central gap on the topmost ring of land.  Making for an&n
&+yawesome sight, the equal possibility of falling renders this perch just that&n
&+ymuch less comfortable.  A &+rvibrant &+Rred &+rhue&+y accompanied by a strange humming&n
&+ysound is coming from within the waterfall to the east; this branch leads&n
&+ysouthwest into the tree as well.&n

&+GOn a Wide Branch Beside the &+cWa&+Cter&+Bfall~
   The raging waterfall rumbles loudly a few feet to the east.  The branch
extending from the tree leads quite close to it, making for a small gap
that even a halfling could jump with the greatest of ease.  The &+rred &+Rhue
is somewhat more distinct here, and seems to be centralized within the
fall at a height equal to that of this branch.  A vibrant humming sound
emanates from that area; intertwined with the near stationary mists and
the droplets of water that stray fiercely from the chute, this creates an
intriguing sight indeed.  The &+cwa&+Cter&+Bfall&n roars loudly to the east, and the
branch leads westwards into the tree.

&+cA &nStone&+c Quay Beside a &+CSmall Village.~
&+b   The lakes' waters seem to calmly converge between these two stone walls
&+bthat both channel the water into a sewage system and serve as a boat dock.
&nThe walls are rather high, and bits of &+Gfish&n trickle down their faces.  To the
&neast, there is a &+ymain pier&n, easily reachable from &+bwater level&n.  Faint sounds
&nof music and laughter can be heard from here, echoing within these stone
&nwalls and enveloping this otherwise peaceful scene.

&+G   The pleasant smells of grass and fresh sea air are predominant here.  A
&+Glarge valley extends to the north and south, and a path which leads wryly
&+Gto a small village just a few leagues to the east.  In its other direction,
&+Gthis path stops abruptly at a small stone structure just a few feet to the
&+Gwest.  This small stone house has no discriminating features, most likely
&+Gsome kind of shed, it has a series of tinted glass windows which face onto
&+Gthe lake from its perch up here on the hill.

&+LBefore a Set of &+WHuge &+CSte&+cel &+LGates~
&+L   The path here leads eastwards through an immense steel gate, and westwards
&+Ltowards a &+Wcry&+Cstal &+Bblue&+L lake.  The gates themselves are the only entrance
&+Lto a massive &+Madamantium wall&+L that lines this path perpendicularly north and
&+Lsouth for a respectable distance.  Several rooftops and towers just from
&+Lthis titanic wall, the latter quite artistically rendered with their
&+Lmultiple aesthetic adornments.  Yet they are not wholly visible, hidden
&+Lbeneath these gargantuan town walls.

&+L   Inside the huge gates and walls, one can truly see the absolute splendour&n
&+Lof this town.  The houses are all made of perfectly moulded bricks, and&n
&+Lthe roofs with shingles of fine adamantium.  Flowers and plantlife are all&n
&+Lartistically placed within the town, mostly about the roadways - speaking of&n
&+Lwhich two of the main ones meet here.  A long road which lines the great&n
&+Lwall, and a second which leads into the center of the town.  Parapets and&n
&+Ltowers jut powerfully from the roofline, and a wonderful haze of sunlight&n
&+Lbathes down onto the well-kept town.  These beings are obviously an equally&n
&+Lintelligent race; if not superior.&n

&+MJenevren &+mRoad~
&+m   Posters of enslaved Umber Hulks being led by Neogi commoners line the&n
&+mcenter of the northern wall.  Trees are cleanly planted into huge soil pots&n
&+mthat are evenly spaced along the interlocked stone sidewalk.  This road is&n
&+mimmaculately clean, save for a few patches of dried blood along the sewer&n
&+mdrain holes that are placed about the southern edge of the street.  A tall&n
&+mtower climbs high, seemingly reaching the clouds a short way to the east.&n

&+MJenevren &+W- &+CDaerkan &+WInt&ners&+Lection&n~
&+m   The roads curves slightly here, giving way to numerous structures and to&n
&+ma fairly wide intersection between two different streets.  Though&n
&+minaccessible from here, a huge &+Wivory &+mtower climbs towards the sky just a few&n
&+msteps to the north, and an ill-kept shop is directly to the west.&+L  To the&n
&+Lsouth, far into the stretch of Daerkan road, there is a magnificent fountain&n
&+Land park - and further even a second tower, this one of some stunning shade&n
&+Lof &+Mpurple&+L.  The road that Jenevren gives onto, Daerkan, appears to be the&n
&+Lcentral road of this quaint little town.&n

&+CDaerkan &+cRoad&+L meets &+GGate &+gRoad&+L at the Central Fountain~
&+L   The grandest intersection in Neoghtom, it represents the crossing of the&n
&+Ltwo main roads in the city.  Running from north to south, Daerkan road joins&n
&+Ltwo beautiful towers across from this central fountain which also marks the&n
&+Lmidpoint between the western gates and the great eastern tower.  There is a&n
&+Lgrand central fountain here, it is a rendering of their god Aan, whose temple&n
&+Lis some way to the east.  Aan actually looks like a huge dragon, and on this&n
&+Lstatue of him, water spirals out from his head, thus creating the illusion&n
&+Lof a series of waves coming from his head.  Water also sprays from his&n
&+Lmouth, and were it fire, the reproduction would stand quite true.  He has&n
&+Leight massive legs and a giant tail that is here curled about his legs.  The&n
&+Lmaking of this fountain must have taken a very long time.  But has seemingly&n
&+Lpaid off, being one of the greatest landmarks ever seen.&n

Books with his symbol on the cover, all written in some unintelligible

in the far corner, and a glass of water on a table beside it.  This looks
like a reading room, but its secrecy must indicate that it is rarely
occupied, and only so by very important clerics that belong to the order of

that has had a numerous amount of dragons sculpted from it.  The top of the
altar was made to look like a dragon's tail holding up a flat slab of the
same stone.  It was all carved from one piece though, since there are no
seperating lines - quite a artistic accomplishment.  A skylight directly
projects a single shaft of light onto the altar, creating quite an impressive
visual effect.

&+WWithin the &+YGreat Cathedral&+W of Aan~
   This part of the cathedral constitutes the whole of the western arch,
pews are placed diagonally in the room, facing the altar in the northeastern
corner of it.  Many statues and holy artifacts are spread as decorum
throughout the room, the visual effect of these only amplified by the many
lit candles that lace the room with light.

&+rThe &+RUnholy Domain &+rof &+RAan~
&+L   Mangled corpses and skeletons alike line the surreal walls about here for&n
&+Las far as the eye can see in either direction.  It is extremely cold here,&n
&+Land a fierce wind blows wildly from every direction.  The sky above races&n
&+Lextremely fast, the sun and moon dance wildly over and about the blurred&n
&+Lclouds.  Strange echoes of loud rumbling sounds echo all over.  Strangely&n
&+Lenough, the snow that covers these lands has an unreal quality to it, as&n
&+Lif it were some kind of gelatin.  A giant pool of blood lay close by.&n

&+LIn the Tunnels of the Lost&n~
&+L   The floor here seems unnervingly translucid, though some footing is somehow&n
&+Lavailable.  A strong freezing wind blasts though these half-clear walls and&n
&+Lechoes reverberate fiercely all throughout, their amplitude phased out by&n
&+Lsome greater disturbance in the air.  &+RRed &+rflashes&+L of light race helplessly&n
&+Ldown the tunnel, their shapes distorting into thin lines as they hurry down&n
&+Lthis damned path.  What lay ahead is quite unclear, this looks much like a&n
&+Lnightmare, save that it is real.&n

&+WIn a &nHall &+Wof &+CS&+ch&+Bi&+bf&+Gt&+Ci&+cng &+WL&+Mi&+mg&+Wh&+Ct&+ms~
&+R   The cave above quickly gives onto an eerie path of mesmerizing colors.&n
&+rFor brief seconds, images of spiders slaying innumberable humanoid shapes and&n
&+Ygaping mouths and eyes flash powerfully about.  These subconscious shocks&n
&+Gcan be none more than a foreshadowing of what is to come, or a frozen lapse&n
&+gof sheer terror, forever captured within these damned walls.  The hall leads&n
&+bdownwards into sheer darkness.  A giant gyrating sphere, located in the&n
&+Bcenter of this hellenic shaft has a single rune brilliantly piercing its&n
&+Mmulticolored exterior.  The rune traditionally means &+Wancients&+M, why it is&n
&+mhere however, is not readily apparent.&n

&+LIn a Chamber of &+RDe&+rad&+Rly&+L Shadows~
&+L   The cold stone that composes this cubical enclave has a bone shivering&n
&+Laura about it.  A slew of maggots and lichen have thrived in time on its&n
&+Ldamp, musty entirety.  Shadows seem to flicker from dark to darker here, and&n
&+Lthey dance with a pattern that is all too magical.  An evil muse had visited&n
&+Lthe architect of this retracted chamber, for the vibe of melancholy is all&n
&+Ltoo present here.&n
