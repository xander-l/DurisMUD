&+yEntrance To The Open Fields&n~
&+y  A small path here leads away from the road and towards the open fields.  As&n
&+ythe expanse of fields seems to be endless, it is a wonder that anybody can&n
&+yfind their way through the tangles.  As the field expands the growth seems&n
&+yto have gotten more and more wild.&n

&+yThe Open Fields&n~
&+y  This is the west corner of the open fields.  Farther off to the west it looks&n
&+yas though the fields become more untame, and to the east the fields extend.&n
&+yOff in the distance to the southwest a &+Ltower&+y can be seen.  The grasses&n
&+ythemselves appear to be getting thicker here as the edge of the field is&n

&+y  Moving around the perimeter of the field, further out more overgrown fields&n
&+ylie.  Here and there some stray blades of grass are here, but still the basic&n
&+yfield is still maintained.  During planting season, this field might be brought&n
&+yback to life again with some seeds or bulbs.  However something in the field&n

&+yThe Open Fields Near a Farmhouse&n~
&+y  An old &+Lfarmhouse&+y appears be here damaged beyond repair assumedly by the pack&n
&+yof large hungry animals running about.  The small wooden dwelling looks as&n
&+ythough it belonged to some unfortunate and not so wealthy farmers.  The&n
&+yfront door of the house appears to be damaged and perhaps one of the mutated&n
&+yanimals sought shelter inside the shelter.  To the east, a grassy hill leads&n
&+yup towards a &+Ltower&+y which looks forebodingly down upon these fields.&n

&+gThe Deep Grasses&n~
&+g  A sick smell assails the nostrils, as many creatures have simply disappeared&N
&+gdeeply into the mess of roots and growth.  Every once in a while, the sounds of&N
&+ga fierce creature can be heard very nearby.  Weeds seem to sprout from&N
&+geverywhere, and it is difficult to tell where you are at all.  Everything here&N

&+LThrough the &+gWoods&n~
&+g  Here the path continues, and seems to be a little bit better defined.  The&N
&+gthick trees seem to close about, and the bits of sky one can see through them&N
&+gare becoming far less.  Birds can be heard chirping from their perches up&N
&+ghigh, but many other animals seem content to stay quiet and out of the way.&N

&+LDeep in the &+gWoods&n~
&+g  At this point, no longer can any break in the woods be seen in front of or&N
&+gbehind.  The fields are long gone, and now only thick forrest stretches out&N
&+gall about.  Bears, deer, squirrels, and many others seem to be shifting&N
&+grelatively quietly all about.  No major sounds are heard, but stirs are heard&N
&+ghere and there.  The thick trees here seem to be of a fairly elderly age,&N
&+gand may have been here for hundreds of years.&N

&+yInside the Beaten Up Farmhouse&n~
&n  The inside of this farmhouse looks like it has been truly destroyed.&n
&nAnimal feces are everywhere, and it looks as though one of the rabbits gnawed&n
&nthrough the wall on one side.  All about lie scraps of cloth and various&n
&npieces of paper.  Splinters from various pieces of furniture and the walls&n
&nthemselves make the floor a treacherous endeavor to cross barefooted.  The&n
&nonly thing intact seems to be a single table which looks to be on its last&n
&nlegs.&n

&+gClimbing the Hill of &+yBrambles&n~
&+y  Moving away from the fields below, this hill slowly inclines towards a tower&n
&+gfrom which much of this growth seems to be coming.  The growth here seems to&n
&+yhave become a much less random thing, and all appears to flow either to or&n
&+gaway from the tower.  Very thick trunks of vine and wood seem to be snaking&n
&+yall about, and sprouting all manner of growth.  Brambles begin to become truly&n
&+gmultiple as they have gathered and knotted.&n

&+gmoving together in an effort to block further trespass into the tower.  Thorns&n
&+yseem to seek blood as they move ever so slowly.  Weeds and growth have become&n
&+gsimply a huge mess which combines together into something barely passable.&n

&+y  Amongst the tangles that wrap themselves around everything, a tall grey tower&n
&+gjuts into the sky here.  The vines seem to climb the tower, and also seem&n
&+Lto spawn from the very top window.  The solid stones appear to have been built&n
&+Lrelatively recently, and only one word appears above the doorway in, "&+MZooox&+L".&n
&+gA loud clamour can be heard coming from inside the tower itself, a strange&n

&+L  This was once a grand beginning to a marvelous stairwell.  However, once this&n

&+Lturned into a mass of chaos and disorder.  The massive beutifully carved&n

&+Lelsewhere because his experiments are in the same spirit as the wildmage's&N

&+LThe Bar of the &+gRaiders&n~
&+y  This bar is one of the main spots in the camp.  Most of the drinking is done&N
&+yright here, and the brewers ale is served.  Often the brew has strange things&N
&+yfloating in it, and has the consistency of snot.  The raiders however drink&N
&+yit with a vengence, with little mind to such minute things as taste.  As&N
&+ywith many spots about the camp, broken furniture and bloodstains indicate that&N
&+yfights have taken place here recently.&N

&+LCorner in the &+gRaider&+L Camp&n~
&+L  While some of the rank smell of the cmap can be attributed to decaying roofs,&N
&+Lsurely the worst offender are its inhabitants.  The inhabitants of the camp,&N
&+Ltruly do not care what lies about whether it be a sharp piece of glass or a&N
&+Lbody.  As the raiders go about their drunk frolicking, it is obvious that the&N
&+Lwoods are an ill fitting spot for their sort.  The trees themselves must mourn&N
&+Lthe fact that this troop has made their home in the woods.  This raider camp&N
&+Lpath is littered with all sorts of refuse of every kind.&N

&+LMoving Through the &+bRaider&+L Camp&n~
&+L  Enourmous feet have mashed what grass used to be here into bits of&N
&+Lnothingness.  If any of those mages had found it, they surely would have set&N
&+Ltheir followers upon it, if nothing else for the sheer enjoyment.  Things to&N
&+Lbe done in a chamber pot, seem to be covering the street.  This camp however,&N
&+Lsomehow has escaped detection by the wildmages.  The trolls and ogres who&N
&+Linhabit this place do not treat it with the proper respect.&N

&+LMess Hall in the &+gRaider&+L Camp&n~
&+y  This mess hall is where all of the raders eat.  It is basically a few benches&N
&+ycovered with the filthy leftovers of whatever meat is being served.  Grease&N
&+yseems to coat everything in the hall, and bloodstains seem to be everywhere.&N
&+yNot all of these bloodstains seem to be from the kitchen side, as it is&N
&+yobvious some of the hungry ogres probably had words with each other about&N
s&+yportions missing from their plates.&N

&+LSmall &+YBrewery&+L in the &+bRaider&+L Camp&n~
&+y  This brewery, is a mix of awful looking liquids and dank dirty barrels.  The&N
&+ybrew produced within the camp often makes the raiders go half blind, but never&N
&+ydoes it leave them disappointed.  The brewer has mastered the art of putting&N
&+ypunch in their ale which makes it of a strength with some of the most notorious&N
&+ydwarven spirits.  The contents of the drink however are never of the same&N
&+yquality, and often are filled with true "floaters".&N

&+LThe Captain's Quarters in the &+bRaider&+L Camp&n~
&+y  Grox lives in these quarters, and takes care of the day to day business of&N
&+ythe raider camp.  Although his older brother has been the leader of the raiders&N
&+yfor years, Grox has often taken care of the details that made this crew&N
&+ysuccessful.  All about, loot taken from different spots is strewn everywhere.&N
&+yVery few would cross the captain, and none would take the chance of taking&N
&+yanything that is his.  A busted desk is where he sits occasionally and speaks&N
&+yto those who seek his counsel.  As is evident from the dents in the wall, that&N
&+ycounsel is rarely anything more than a pummeling.&N

&+LThe Weaponsmith in The &+bRaiders&+L Camp&n~
&+y  This smithy is the spot where all the raiders come to have their weapons&N
&+yrepaired, or replaced.  Although most are roudy and have no problems being&N
&+ysuch even in the face of their commanders, a certain respect is given to&N
&+ythe smithy as he is an elder and scar ridden veteran.  His shop has turned&N
&+yinto a battelground but few times when somebody not bright enough to steer&N
&+yclear of his temper, harassed him about getting something repaired a little&N
&+ytoo much.&N

&+LNearing the Hut of the Raider Leader, &+bG&+gr&+bo&+gg&n~
&+L  This is right outside the raider leader's hut.  To the east is where the&N
&+Linfamous raider Grog has lived for quite some time.  The entrance is of course&N
&+Lguarded, as he still has quite a few enemies.  When the camp was created long&N
&+Lago, he picked this area specifically to be deeper in the woods and more&N
&+Lisolated so he could pick out the sounds of approaching trouble as opposed&N
&+Lto the footsteps of drunk raiders.&N

&+LThe Hut of &+bG&+gr&+bo&+gg&N~
&+y  This hut is the dwelling of the most infamous land pirate of them all.  The&N
&+ywalls are decorated with skulls and blades of those who fell to his sword.&N
&+yAll about, this elderly raiders memorabilia impresses even the casual observer.&N
&+yAs the raider has gotten older, he cares less and less about going out and&N
&+ynow lives more amongst his memorabilia.  He occasionally does however lead&N
&+ythe raiders on an onslaught, but he only chooses special occasions now.&N

&+Lthe way out and back to another plane.  However, this task is not something&N
&+Lthat anyone without years at their disposal should try.&N
