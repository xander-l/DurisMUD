The Entrance to the &+cSilver&N &+LMine&N~
&N   The entrance to the &+cSilver&N&+L Mine&N is free of any clutter or debris.
&NThe ground seems to be free of any &+gplants&N or &+ggrasses&N and the &+Ldirt&N
&Nhas been compacted by the stamping of many boots.  Although the &+Lmine&N
&Ndoesn't look overly neglected, it does not appear the miners care about
&Nwhat it look like to visitors at all.  One may head back to the west
&Nor east through the entrance.&N

&N&+LInside the &+cSilver&N&+L Mine&N~
&N   The entrance to the &N&+Lmine&N is relatively narrow with a quite low ceiling.&N
&NThe&N&+L rock &Nitself has been worked smooth, but little decoration adorns the walls.
&NDeep &N&+ycart &Ntracks have been carved into the floor to keep the minerals flowing
&Never out.  One may travel west out of the &+Lmine&N or east further in.&N

&+LA Turn in the Tunnel&N~
&N   &+LThe tunnel turns sharply and slighly down to the north.  This part of
&+Lthe tunnel is slightly dirtier.  Soot covers the walls near the &+ytorch&N
&+Lsconces.  Little changes in this kind of mining tunnel but a few nooks
&+Lcan be seen at various heights.  The ceiling is still quite low and
&+Lhard to navigate if too tall.  One may travel west or north.&N

&+LA Widening Tunnel in the &N&+cSilver&N&+L Mine&N~
&N&+L   The tunnel begins to widen at this point.  There are &N&+ywooden supports&N&+L adding &N
&+Lstrength to the structure.  This section of the tunnel appears to be a
&+Lstaging area.  Hardhats are hung on &N&+ywooden&N&+L pegs drilled into the wall.  A

&N&+LA Wide Tunnel in the &N&+cSilver&N&+L Mine&N~
&N&+L   The tunnel begins to widen, even as it becomes less finished.  The walls
&N&+Lare quite rough at this point in the mine.  The ceiling is supported by
&N&+Lsturdy &N&+ywooden beams&N&+L.  While the air grows stale, a slight breeze can be felt
&N&+Lcoming from the direction of the entrance.  The darkness is oppressive and
&N&+Lhaving a &N&+Wlight&N&+L source is absolutely necessary for those without the ability
&N&+Lto see in the dark.  One may travel north or south from this point.&N

&N&+Lin pictograms and hieroglyphs, most of which are in the common tongue.
&N&+LNone of them appear to be very interesting and most look like graffiti.
&N&+LThe &N&+ywooden door&N&+L is slightly recessed into the stone wall and the hinges

&N&+Lhang from pegs in the wall.  A few small&N&+b water &N&+ybarrels&N&+L reside in the

&N&+Lbut a few are still covered with dirty dishes and goblets.
&N&+LThe ground is quite smooth in this part of the barracks,
&N&+Lmost likely in an effort to keep the area clean.  A few
&N&+Cknives&N&+L and &N&+Cforks&N&+L appear to be stuck in the &N&+ywooden&N&+L support

&N&+Lleading away from the hole itself, used to transport materials
&N&+Lout of the mine.  Several large &N&+ycrates&N&+L are visible, an inventory
&N&+Lof &N&+Yriches &N&+Lharvested from the stone.  Several &N&+bwater &N&+cbuckets&N&+L are

on an axle.  The clever engineers have harnessed some natural
gas to propel a simple &N&+Rcombustion &N&+Lengine&N.  The engine turns long
&N&+ybelts&N that are attached to a &N&+yflywheel&N on the &N&+Csaw&N.  The &N&+Cblade&N is
about six feel across and has dozens of sharp &N&+Wteeth&N.  Large blocks
of &N&+ywood &Ncan be sawed into various thickness.  &N&+ySawdust&N covers the
floor here and the finer particulate hangs in the air like a

&NThe Crafters Area of the &N&+yWood&N Shop&N~
   This room is filled with the tools used for finishing&N&+y wood&N
projects.  There are several hand cranking drill presses that
seem to be of the industrial nature.  Several long &N&+yshelves&N are
filled with various &N&+ysandpaper&N and &N&+Lchisels&N while large&N&+L pots &Nof
&N&+Wglue&N have been piled up near the wall.  One may travel east
from this point in the &N&+ywoodshop&N.&N

&N&+LApproaching the End of the Central Line&N~
&N&+L   The tunnel starts to narrow at this point and the amount
&N&+Lof activity seems to be increasing.  This is where the active
&N&+Lmining is taking place.  Large boulders are being steadily
&N&+Lworked into smaller, workable chunks.  Lots of&N&+w dust&N&+L and dirt
&N&+Lseem to coat everything.  Heavy &N&+ywooden timbers &N&+Lhave been set
&N&+Lin place to add strength to the tunnel.  One may travel west

&N&+LThe End of the Line&N~

&N&+Lcutting their way into solid rock.  One can see the heavy&N&+c silver&N
&N&+cvein &N&+Lvisible with smaller protrusions spiraling away from the
&N&+Lmain vein.  Several &N&+ywooden racks&N&+L filled with various &N&+cpicks&N&+L and
&N&+Lbars is visible on the north wall.  Other&N&+y tools &N&+Lhave been left
&N&+Lhaphazardly around the eastern wall, implements to harvest the

&N&+LThe Beginning of a New Mine Shaft&N~
&N&+L   This tunnel appears to be the newest tunnel branching off the
&N&+Lmain hub.  The walls are very rough with no attempt at making
&N&+Lany surface smooth.  Even the floor is rough and uneven.  While
&N&+Lit is impossible to guess what &N&+cmineral&N&+L the miners are after, it
&N&+Lis a safe bet it is a valuable &N&+core&N&+L.  &N&+yTorches&N&+L are spaced out evenly
&N&+Lnear air vents to prevent the toxic &N&+wsmoke&N&+L from accumulating.  The
&N&+Lair is fetid and rather unpleasant. One may travel north or
&N&+Lsouth from this point.&N

&+LA Newly Dug &N&+cSilver &N&+LTunnel&N~
&N&+L   This new tunnel appears to be of an exploratory nature.  While
&N&+Lthe tunnel doesn't veer off into any specific direction, the cuts
&N&+Lare methodical.  With great purpose this stone has been worked.
&N&+LThe tunnel slopes every so slightly downward.  Small &N&+Ylanterns&N&+L have
&N&+Lbeen hung every fifty or so feet, barely &N&+Willuminating&N&+L the tunnel.

&N&+Limplements laying about the room.  A few &N&+ywooden chairs &N&+Lcan be
&N&+Lseen near the wall and &N&+Wgarbage &N&+Llitters the floor.  There is a

&N&+Ldown the slight slope, collecting in small pools and then boiling
&N&+Lfrom the &N&+rheat&N&+L.  &N&+WWhite froth &N&+Lcollects at the edge of each pool, a
&N&+Lbiproduct from the boiling process.  The air is thick with &N&+wsmoke&N

&N&+Lspite of the lack of burnable materials.  The ground is rocky and uneven
&N&+Land there is a great deal of &N&+wdust&N&+L covering the ground.  More than makes

&N&+Ltunnel.  Little differentiation can be detected in the tunnel itself as
&N&+Lall of it is roughly cut and poorly supported.  Whoever made this tunnel
&N&+Lput no care into safety or cave-in prevention.  The ground is covered in
&N&+Lrubble and some &N&+Wbones&N&+L, while the walls have dirty &N&+whandprints &N&+Land a few

out of the solid &N&+Lstone&N spent a great deal of time making the &N&+Wvault&N
secure.  No windows are visible and the only exit is to the south,
the &N&+Wvault &Ndoor itself.  It hangs on heavy &N&+Lhinges&N and is made of
