&+LVault of the &+RDe&+rmo&+Rn &+rPr&+Rin&+rce&n~
&+L   The &+RDemon &+rPr&+Rin&+rce&+L, &+RSei&+Lk Ka&+R'zam&+L controls the minions of this pit from
&+Lthis room, barking out orders to all around him.  The room is &+Wunlit&n
&+Lother than for a &+rflaming br&+Raz&+ri&+Rer&+L burning against the furthest wall.
&+LIt is not for &+Willumination&+L but rather for mystic incantations, and
&+Lacts as communications from the &+rPr&+Rin&+rce&+L to the other rules of the
&+LPits including &+RAbaddon&+L himself.  A pile of &+Cgar&+cgoy&+Lle &+Wbones&+L collects

&+L   The tunnel comes to a deadend here, with the black rock wall
&+Lof the pit cutting any further movement ahead abrubtly.  Several
&+Cgar&+cgoy&+Lles have made perches along the walls and now sleep soundly.
&+LNests, full of their eggs can be seen high up, out of reach,
&+Land tucked neatly away inside the recesses of the cavern.  The

&+yA family of &+Wrocs&+y have made their nest up here, in the seclusion of

&+yafter spending some time gazing out over the plains in a quiet serenity.
&+yThe barren mountainside stands out in start contrast against the

&+yNear a Large &+YCampsite&n~
&+y   The &+YSavannah&+y ends to the north and west here with the regular
&+yrocky terrain serves as a sort of cage for both wildlife and travellers.
&+yProceeding further in either direction could be quite hazardous and
&+ynot even the &+YSavannah&+y animals--save for a few mountain g&+Woa&+yts, wander
&+yout across the outcroppings.  Sounds from a campsite can be heard to
&+ythe east of here, where several mercenaries have made preparations
&+yfor the evening. &n

&+yA &+LPath&+y Around the &+LFoothills&n~
&+y   Over many years of adventurers travelling to this region a &+Lpathway&n
&+yhas formed that encircles the central mountain.  Travellers have
&+ylonged hoped for a easier route up the mountain, or perhaps to
&+yfind new tunnels leading into the &+Ytreasure&+y rooms of the &+LPits of&n
&+rCerberus&+y with no luck and the route up the mountain remains to be
&+yfull of dangers for the unskilled.  North of here the sounds of
&+ycampers can be heard and south the &+YSavannah&+y continues.&n

&+yWithin the &+YSavannah&+y of &+YSorrow&n~
&+y   The &+YSavannah&+y continues here with the rocky soil that is so
&+ycommon in this region.  The animals frolick and graze through
&+ythe plains, all but carefree other than the knowledge that just
&+ybelow the surface lie the &+LPits of &+rCerberus&+y.  Rumors of clawed
&+yhands reaching out from the &+LPits&+y at night and grabbing whatever
&+yis walking by at the moment are not uncommon, and &+Ycamels&+y would
&+ymake an easy target for just about anything--being as they aren't
&+ythe brightest animal in the world.  To the north some travellers
&+yhave set up a campsite.&n

&+yAt a Large &+YCampsite&n~
&+y   The northeastern edge of the &+YSavannah&+y makes a good spot for a &+Ycamping&n
&+yground.  The wind that can blow an uncomfortable chill into living tissue
&+yat night is reduced due to the mountainous cliffs on north and east sides.
&+yA group of &+Ytreasure&+y seekers sit here resting, regailing each other with
&+ystories of the past and rumours of the treasure that is hidden deep
&+yinside the &+LPits&+y.  They have a small fire burning here for warmth and
&+Wlight&+y.&n

&+yAt an Enormous &+LAnthill&n~
&+y   An enormous &+Lanthill&+y is the center of attention in this part of the
&+YSavannah&+y. It rises up out of the ground nearly eight feet and it
&+yhome to millions of &+Lants&+y.  The &+Lants&+y are contantly scurring in and
&+yout of the &+Lanthill&+y, making it look alive with movement.  The
&+YSavannah&+y continues to the south and west, the other directions
&+yblocked by unpassable rocky outcroppings.&n

&+y&+yD&+Yo&+ygs, who have lived all their &+ylife here, out in the desert plains,
&+yrun about, barking at &+ythe birds.  The air is hot and dry, though
&+yquite comfortable, &+yand all the animals have learned to adapt quite well
&+yto the climate.  Just to the west an opening to one of the &+LPits of
&+rCerberus&+y can been seen, just barely visible against the rising rock
&+ywall of the central &+wmountain&+y.  The &+Lpath&+y around the &+wmountain&+y is north.

&+yAmong a &+LPit&n~
&+y   Here lies yet another entrance to the fabled &+LPits of &+rCerberus&+y.  The
&+yentrance itself is nothing more than a hole in the ground, just
&+ylarge enough for someone to squeeze through with a fair ammount of
&+yeffort.  Against the western edge, the mountain rises up from the
&+yearth though unclimbable from this side.  The &+Lpath&+y that circles
&+ythe mountain continues to the south.&n

&+bThe &+LWar &+bRoom &+Lof &+bGo&+Lrg&+bor&n~
&+L   This is the chamber of the dreaded and fearsome ettin, &+bGo&+Lrg&+bor&+L.
&+LHere, this two headed monster communicates with the other overlords
&+Lof the Pits by using a mystic brazier.  Though he is not in charge
&+Lof large groups of soldiers, he is still vital to the Pits assaults
&+Lagainst the &+CHome&+W of the&+C Divine&+L.  His visage strikes fear into the
&+Lhearts of the &+Can&+Wgels&+L, as he flies down to attack from his pet smoke
&+Ldragon he keeps tied to the back of the room during its training.
&+LThe dragon wails at the imprisonment from time to time, but mostly
&+Lkeeps quiet to avoid the wrath of its master, &+bGo&+Lrg&+bor&+L.&n

&+L   This is the captains room of &+rSpite&+Llan, &+rCerberus'&+L zealot of &+YHate&+L.
&+LThe githyanki captain is a master of stragetic tactics and is usually
&+Lthe primary general in leading the assaults against the &+CHome&+W of the&n
&+CDivine&+L.  The room here is a circular black tile, with a large table
&+Land chair located in the center, where &+rSpite&+Llan spends his time
&+Lpeering over battle plans.  At the far end of the room a couple
&+Cang&+Wels&+L, captured during a raid to the &+CHome&+L, are chained and secured

&+LThe War Room of &+rScorn&n~
&+L   Here sits the war room of &+rScorn&+L, the highlord of the armies of
&+rCerberus&+L.  Unlike &+rSpite&+Llan, who is high ranking in the armies, Scorn
&+Lactually controls the majority of the forces that invade the &+CHome&+W of&n
&+Wthe &+CDivine&+L on a continual basis.  Though he gets input from the other
&+Loverlords of the Pits, it is &+rScorn&+L himself who carries out all the
&+Lplans.  Usually their are a few number of soldiers with him at all
&+Ltimes, and more often than not he is discussing plans for the next
&+Linvasion with them.  The room is devoid of any furnishing, other
&+Lthan a large map on the far wall of the &+CHome&+W of the &+CDivine's&n

&+CGre&+cn's Cha&+Cmber o&+cf Conjura&+Ctions&n~
&+L   This is the chamber of &+CGren&+L, the evil &+Cdji&+cnn&+L captain of &+rCerberus&+L.
&+LHe is perhaps the oldest of the four generals, as his kind know not
&+Lthe meaning of age.  The room is swirling with a dark mist, most
&+Llikely cast upon by &+CGren&+L himself, or leftover from the vapor trail
&+Lthat seeps out from the &+Rfie&+rry &+Rpor&+rtal&+L just south of this room.
&+LThe room is empty other than &+CGren&+L and his pets, as he stands in
&+Lthe center, flowing like the wind, arms raised in a attempt to
&+Lsummon more fearful beasts with the power of his dark arts.&n

&+y   The &+Lpath&+y changes here from the hard, &+Ysun&+y-baked &+YSavannah&+y soil to a
&+ywell-used gravel &+wroad&+y.  The &+wroad&+y runs the length from the &+YSavannah&n
&+yto the small village of &+cDesolate&+y and is quite popular with wagon
&+ytrains and caravans as well as just the usual band of travellers.
&+yThough the journey is quite long, it is relatively safe, and many
&+yadventurers perfer travelling along this route other than through
&+ythe wilderness, especially after dark, as the closer one gets to
&+cDesolate&+y, the number of patrols keeping an eye out for the forces
&+yof evil greatly increase.&n

&+yand snakes the ability to travel through the network of the &+Lpit&+y
&+yfreely, as they just wind their way through, nearly completely
&+yunhindered.&n

&+yAt a Large Slab of Earth&n~
&+y   The tunnel ends with a large slab of movable earth beneath one's
&+yfeet here.  The snakes and worms inside the &+Lpit&+y seem more aggresive
&+yhere, further in the pit, and it would be wise to be cautious.  A
&+ylarge &+Lgolem&+y, seemingly made from the soil of the &+Lpit&+y itself, stands
&+yon the slab of earth, making it impossible to move down unless
&+ythe &+Lgolem&+y is destroyed first.&n

&+yDeadend in the &+LPit&+y of Worms&n~
&+y   This appears to be yet another deadend inside the network of
&+ytunnels.  Sand and soil fall on ones head from the room above, now
&+ythat the slab has been opened.  The snakes above hiss and spit
&+yviolently but oddly enough won't risk coming down.&n

&+LThe &+ySultan's&+L Chamber&n~
&+y   This is the throne room--if you can call it that, of the Sultan
&+yof Snakes, the overseer of this &+Lpit&+y.  The room is nearly identical to
&+yall the others within the network of tunnels, lacking any furnishings
&+yor objects to set it apart, though the Sultan seems to find this
&+yroom appealing enough to make it his lair for himself and his slimy
&+Laids&+y who coil up around him acting as a type of bodyguard.&n

&+yInside the &+LPit&+y of Worms&n~
&+y   This &+Lpit&+y can be quite hard to navigate for adventurers without
&+ythe proper guide.  The larger worms that live here are usually the
&+yones that are responible for the network of tunnels, they dig through
&+ythe soil, connecting the maze like &+Lpit&+y with a blind, unintelligent,
&+ypurpose.&n

&+yA Rock Worm Lair&n~
&+y   The rock worms inside the &+Lpit&+y don't usually stay in one place for
&+ylong but occasionally they will take up a tempory residence in a
&+ycomfortable location.  Within the shelter of the soil, several rock
&+yworms have coiled up here for a peaceful sleep, resting just long enough
&+yuntil they have enough strength to go back to digging through the &+Lpit&+y.&n

&+ynever any need for any sort of efficiency that a regular, smarter
&+yperson of the world would be accustomed too.  The worms just
&+ydig and eat, then stop and head in another direction.&n

&+yInside the &+LPit&+y of Worms&n~
&+y   The tunnel continues to wind through soft soil. It is apparent
&+ythat the earth of this &+Lpit&+y is the way it is due to the mass of worms
&+yand snakes that are constantly travelling through it.  Though most
&+ythe squirmy creatures that live here are too small to make anything
&+yas large as a walkable tunnel, their must be something inside here
&+ythat is sizable enough to do it.&n

&+yA &+LViper&+y Nest&n~
&+y   Here lies a nest of sand &+Lvipers&+y, several of which have grown quite
&+ylarge over the years.  These snakes are some of the more aggressive
&+ycreatures within the &+Lpit&+y, and should be dealt with accordingly.  The
&+ysoil in this room is extremely soft and crumbling under one's feet,
&+yand could prove difficult to climb back up.&n
