&+RA Giant S&+rh&+Ri&+rm&+Rm&+re&+Rr&+ri&+Rn&+rg&n &+RWall of Color&n~
&+R   A great wall of &+Gc&+Yo&+Wl&+Mo&+Br &+Rrises from the ethereal fog, a boundary that's&n
&+Rstrangely out of place in this environment.  The wall doesn't appear to
&+Rprevent passage from one side to the other.  Instead, it only looks to
&+Rmark some mysterious boundary seperating the &+BDeep Ethereal &+Rfrom whatever
&+Ris on the other side.  The wall flashes with brilliant &+Yp&+Gu&+Bl&+Ws&+Ge&+Cs &+Rof color,
&+Rrapidly blinking through the entire &+Gs&+Wp&+Ce&+Wc&+Bt&+Mr&+Yu&+Bm &+Rwith an almost blinding
&+Rbrightness.&n

&+BThe Deep Ethereal&n~
&+B   A great ocean of &+Rmu&+Glt&+Yi-c&+Bol&+Mor&+Red &+Gfo&+Yg&+B, the Ethereal Plane is a vast, realm
&+Bof &+Rreds,&n &+bblues,&n &+Ggreens,&+B and &+Wsilvers &+Bswirling together endlessly.  This
&+Bgigantic expanse of vapor stretches on infinitely, a ghostly web that touches
&+Balmost everything on every other plane of existence.  Time seems to mean
&+Blittle here, and distance means nothing at all.  Occasionally, a &+Rb&+rl&+Ro&+rb&n &+Bof
&+Bmatter will appear out of the fog, a small piece of another plane that's&n
&+Bfound its way here.&n

make out what the &+Lwhispers&n are saying, and they don't get any louder or
more quiet no matter what your position is.   The walls are made of simple
stone, with no gaps, holes, or cracks to explain where the &+Lvoices&n are
coming from.  The &+Lvoices&n are a constant, maddening presence in the short
hallway, and quite uncomfortable to listen to for some reason.

&+Rpitched screams can be heard coming from all sides of the room.  As soon
&+ras the red light stops flickering, however, the screaming cuts off
&+Rinstantly.   A circular door is set in the northern wall of the pit, and a
&+rladder leads down in the middle of the bowl-like floor.  Another
&+Rcircular door leads south from this room into a dark hallway.

&+LA Dank Slaadi Throneroom&n~
&+y   A damp murky room, lit only by a few magical globes hanging from the
&+yceiling, this cavernous place is apparently the throne room of the slaadi
&+ywho are working for Aramus.  A small stone pedestal sits at one end of the
&+yroom, and it is topped by a gigantic stone throne, made of brass and
&+ycovered with gemstones.  The brass and gems are dirty and covered with a
&+ygreasy slime, and most of the room smells of fungus and stale water.

&+L  This hallway leads south from the slaadi throneroom, and the smells from
&+ythat area drift down this corridor, an unpleasant stench mixed from mold,
&+Lfungus, and dirt.  The hallway is filled with a thin layer of water, about
&+yhalf and inch deep at the south end of the hallway, but slowly getting
&+Ldeeper towards the north end.  The water smells stale and stagnant, and is
&+ycovered in a yellow moss in certain places.  The moss almost seems to be

&+gfeeling that all is not what it appears.  The dirt path leads directly to
&+gthe base of the mighty tree, pointing to a small wooden doorway nestled
&+gbetween two great roots.  The door has a small, decorated glass window on

Inside an Ancient Tree~
&+y   Inside the great tree is a small home, cozy but looking as if it has
&+ybeen deserted for decades.  Dust and cobwebs cover the walls, floors,
&+yand the sparse furnishings of the room.  A small kitchen and bedroom
&+yhave been carved out of the guts of the tree, but they are in the same
&+ystate of disarray as this room.  The only thing of real interest in the
&+yroom is a deep, dark pit in the middle of the room.  The pit does not
&+ylook like it has been carved out, like the rest of the home.  Instead,
&+yit looks as though something exploded or burrowed its way out of the
&+yfloor from below.   Nothing but a still blackness can be seen in the
&+ydepths of the pit, but a cold breeze seems to waft up from below.

&+LA Stone Crossroad in the Fortress&n~
&n   Stairs lead down from a wooden door to this intersection of hallways.
Halls lead in all four of the cardinal directions, and all four hallways
look identical, even down to the positioning and size of the torches in
the walls.  The only thing different about each hall is the picture that
hangs on the right-side wall.  Each passage has a different painting on
it, all the same size and style, but a different person is displayed.
From this position, you cannot make out any details of the pictures,
except each one shows only a single, solitairy figure.  Each of the
four passages extends into darkness and the destinations cannot be seen.

doorway at the north end.  The hallway is barren, except for torches set
in the walls at equal intervals, roughly ten feet apart, and an oil
painting hanging from the east wall.  Roughly five feet wide by seven
feet high, it is a portrait of a well-built, stern looking individual.
He is possibly a religious figure, since he wears the simple white
robes of a cleric and other religious imagery is apparent on the
painting.  You would guess the man to be a human in his late sixties,
still looking strong and active despite his age.  The painting is a
richly detailed piece of art, but looks out of place hanging on the
fortress hallway wall.

color.  The painting is a richly detailed piece of art, but looks out of

painting hanging from the north wall.  Roughly five feet wide by seven
feet high, it is a portrait of a scrawny goblin, sickly thin and an
abnormally pale shade of green.  The goblin is missing his left ear, and
his left eye is covered with a pale white film.  Clutching a goblin holy
symbol in a death grip, he looks frightened of something, clearly
terrified at some thing that isn't in the picture.  The painting is
a richly detailed piece of art, but looks out of place hanging on the
fortress hallway wall.

&+RThe Treasure Room of Aramus&n~
&+B   The treasure room of Aramus stretches out before you... a vast expanse
&+Gof... nothing.  The gold and platinum that covers the floors is all
&+Rillusional, the mighty weapons of war that sit on shelves or lie stacking
&+Yon the floor are fakes, and the piles of jewels and precious gems aren't
&+Cprecious or even real.

paintings and tapesties, and exquisite furnishings fit for a palace.
Looking around though, something seems wrong.  Out of the corner of your
eye, you think you see a &+rblood red haze&n covering everything like a blanket.
This &+rfog&n never appears directly and you can't really be sure that its not
just a trick of the mind.  A short stairway leads up to a wooden door in
the ceiling, and another door blocks passage to the south.
