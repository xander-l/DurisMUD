&+yAn Extremely Tall Tree~
  The forest backs off here, as in awe of the offspring it has sprouted. This
tree must be at least 100 spans high, reaching well above the rest of the
dark forest's canopy. Enough sunlight pierces the opening, to allow one to
guage the sun's position in the sky. A cleaner, gentler feeling is to be had
here, as though this magnificent tree is able to somehow 'ward' off the evils
that permute this place.

&+gA Glimpse of a Large Mound~
&+y  Directly to your south, and surrounded by these web-enshrouded trees,
&+yis a large mound covered in grass. Normally, a mound would not attract your
&+yattentions, but this one seems.. somehow different.. Especially considering
&+ythe fact that not 5 long-spans to the south of this vile forest lies the
&+yCalimshan desert where little grows, and also that you have seen not one
&+ygrowth in this place at all, except for the evil trees that have stolen
&+yyour way.

&+gThe Edge of the Forest of Mir~
&+g  A dark and sinister forest begins here. Strips of what appears to be
&+gwebbing hang from the trees, billowing in the light wind. East lies open
&+gplains; much less sinister than the forest, but also much less protective
&+gcover. Slightly to the east and an untold number of long-spans to the north,
&+ga small mountain range rises.

&+yAn Extremely Tall Tree~
  The forest backs off here, as in awe of the offspring it has sprouted. This
tree must be at least 100 spans high, reaching well above the rest of the
dark forest's canopy. Enough sunlight pierces the opening, to allow one to
guage the sun's position in the sky. A cleaner, gentler feeling is to be had
here, as though this magnificent tree is able to somehow 'ward' off the evils
that permute this place.

&+LBase of the Mountain~
  The forest has ceased its encroachment here, most likely due to the ground
turning to pure rock. South, the ground begins to turn straight up, climbing
ever higher into the sky. The mountain-face is dark, and somewhat slick looking,
discouraging easy access. North lies the vile, web-enshrouded, Forest of Mir.

&+yAn Extremely Tall Tree~
  The forest backs off here, as in awe of the offspring it has sprouted. This
tree must be at least 100 spans high, reaching well above the rest of the
dark forest's canopy. Enough sunlight pierces the opening, to allow one to
guage the sun's position in the sky. A cleaner, gentler feeling is to be had
here, as though this magnificent tree is able to somehow 'ward' off the evils
that permute this place.

&+yAn Extremely Tall Tree~
  The forest backs off here, as in awe of the offspring it has sprouted. This
tree must be at least 100 spans high, reaching well above the rest of the
dark forest's canopy. Enough sunlight pierces the opening, to allow one to
guage the sun's position in the sky. A cleaner, gentler feeling is to be had
here, as though this magnificent tree is able to somehow 'ward' off the evils
that permute this place.

&+gTop of a Tall Tree~
   From this vantage point, 20 spans above the canopy level, an excellent view
of the countryside may be had. Unfortunately, the majority of your panorama is
the vile forest of Mir. You deem yourself to be at the far northwestern corner
of the forest, in the heart of the Kingdom of Tethyr. Although there are no
signs of any homes near this edge of Mir, a strip of road 3 longspans to the
north, stretches the horizon from east to west. A faint plume of dust moves
steadily along it, indicating traffic of some kind.

&+yA Vertical Tunnel Cut In Granite&n~
&+y   Here the vertical tunnel tightens slightly. Its diameter lowers down to
&+ytwenty yards. The granite walls all around are smoith, giving few points of
&+ysupport. It's really easy to slip and fall down. And down in the tunnel,
&+ythere's nothing but the darkness. The eastern wall is filled with cracks
&+yof various sizes and shapes. Maybe one is big enough to pass through it?

&+yA &+LDark Pit&+y Filled With Snakes~
&+L    All walls in this circular chamber are surprisingly smooth. Just as if
&+Lsomeone or something put a great deal of work to ensure that noone will climb
&+Lup. In the center of the chamber, a bone casket stands on a small podium.
&+LThe floor here is made from polished black granite, just like the walls.
&+LIt differs greatly from the brown granite in the tunnel up from here.
&+LWhoever made this chamber, he for sure wanted everyone who falls into it to
&+Lget overhelmed by visions of death...

&+yA Tunnel Carved in Granite&n~
&+y   The granite tunnel continues. It is dig in the same plain brown granite
&+ythat can be spot in almost every place on every continent. Still, the one here
&+yradiates with a faint aura that cannot be possibly identified. Or maybe it is
&+ynot the granite itself, but something that dwells these tunnels, and embedded
&+yits sign into everything around...  The tunnel bends here, tightening to the
&+ynorth, and leading into the darkness through the wide crack to the west.

&+yA Tight Bend in the Tunnel&n~
&+y   The tunnel tightens here i&+rnto a re&+yally narrow passage. It leads downward
&+yfrom here, with slight east decl&+rina&+ytion. With its other end, the tunnel
&+ydisappears in the darkness south&+r of&+y here. The walls here, as well as the floor
&+yand ceiling, are made from the b&+rrow&+yn granite that is so common here.
&+yThe passage is so narrow that &+rtwo peo&+yple of average size can barely fit here
&+yat once.

&+yThe Opening of a &+mHuge&+y Cavern&n~
&+y   The granite tunnel leading from upward direction widens he&+mre greatly,
&+yforming an entrance to the vast cave just east from he&+mre. Clouds of hot smoke
&+yfloat in from the cave, sometimes replaced b&+my chilly white fog. The walls all
&+yaround are still made from rough granite. The floor &+mis bruised with many marks
&+yof some gargantuan beasts passing through this tunnel.

&+YThe Treasure Room of Wyrms&n~
&+Y   This small chamber obviously serves as a treasure vault for the great
&+Ywyrms dwelling these caves. They gather here the most precious equipement
&+Ystripped off the adventurers that was unlucky and stupid enough to come up
&+Ywith an idea of exploring down here. Huge piles of gold and platinum coins
&+Ylies here, stacked under walls. In the middle of the room, there is a place
&+Yfor power equipement. The room itself is rather dull, with plain granite walls
&+Yand polished granite floor. A strong granite trapdoor block upward exit.
