&+gA Path Through a Jungle~
&+L  Coming out of the valley here, this path is very crudly worn in and
&+Lthere aren't much signs of civilization around here. Most of the area
&+Lis thick dense jungle getting more complex as the path continues. The
&+Lmost noticeable thing about the surroundings is the extreme height of the
&+Ltrees, and the vines which spread between them. The undergrowth has many
&+Lvarieties of plants and animals taking refuge against the winds there.

&+gDeeper Into the Jungle~
&+L  This small jungle grows in density here as the path continues through
&+Lthe endless sea of vines and trees. The path seems to be traveled very
&+Lrarly and can in some places, the path is hardly visible. Several different
&+Ltypes of varius fruits grow along the vines and trees here providing food
&+Lfor the local wild life. The vines grow thick here, as if they could hold
&+Lthe weight of a person.

&+gA Tribal Path~
&+L  The path here becomes more distinct and seems to be the only thing that
&+Lthat stands out among the vast trees and vines. The path is oddly covered
&+Land decorated with many strange objects. Along the path lie small spikes
&+Lin the ground, with guted skulls mounted upon them. The path, made of
&+Lsmall pebbles, seems like it could run forever off into the horizion.

&+gA Split in a Tribal Path~
&+L  The path forks off here to the north and the south. The path lying to
&+Lthe south is fairly overgrown and doesn't seem to be traveled by much, but
&+Lthe northern path is extremely different. Small animal foot prints in the
&+Lmud trail north, along with a more extensive set of decorative items on
&+Lthe path. The intersection here lies in a small clearing by a huge bouldar
&+Lright at the intersection.

&+Mabout the tree tops, which are mainly composed of small bloodstained ferns,
&+Mbones of various types, and wood gathered from the forest. There are
&+Mfrightening screams off in the distance and rustling all about the trees.

&+gA Jungle Trail~
&+L  This faint trail that rolls through the jungle has obviously not been
&+Lused in a long time. The trail is barely visible and it is very much
&+Lovergrown. Vines grow from tree to tree providing small bridges for the
&+Lsmall forest animals. There are several colorful plants in this immiediate
&+Larea including a small patch of green flowers.

&+gA Large Tree House~
&+y  This tree house is the home of a small trapper of the region by the
&+yname of Halgeous. There are several traps, some disarmed, some not, about
&+ythe property, and a small rope leading up to a tree house made of hard
&+ymaple wood and ferns. There is also a small ladder going up the tree.
&+ySmall pet cages are all about the small vegetable gardens of this little
&+ygrove.

&+gA Jungle Trail~
&+L  The jungle trail twists and turns around here, matching the curves of
&+Lthe jungle. The trail is barely visible by the naked eye most of the time
&+Ldue to the fact that it seems it hasn't had any use in quite some time.
&+LThe trees soar high into the sky with thick vines inbetween them where
&+Lsmall to large nests can be seen. There are several small yellow flowers
&+Lgrowing near here.

&+gA Jungle Trail~
&+L  The trail twists around here along with the vines and trees. There are
&+Lno colorful flowers or anything growing around here, only a vast web of
&+Llarge thick vines that hang and drape over the trees. There are small
&+Lspider webs that have been finely spun as expert traps for the unsuspecting
&+Linsects of the jungle. There are a few small bouldars around the area,
&+Ljust providing something for moss to grow on, and grubs to live under.
