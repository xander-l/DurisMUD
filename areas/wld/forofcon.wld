&+yA Forest Path&n~
&+g   The road starts to fade away into a forest path here.  Use of this path
&+gis evident but it seems not traveled much.  The forest path winds its way
&+gthrough the vegetation.  There is little noise and every footstep made
&+gcreates a obvious sound.  All around are &+ytrees&+g and &+Gshrubs&n&+g.  Animal noises
&+gcan be heard in the distance.&n

&+w   Everything in this chamber shows signs of neglect and the stamp of
&+wunrelenting time.  Cracks run rampant in jagged zigs and zags across the
&+Lflagstone&n&+w floor and til&+bed walls.  The pl&+waster upon the ceiling, once
&+La&n&+rpparent&+Ll&n&+wy depicting &+ba subtle underwater s&+wcene, has peeled and fallen away
&+Lt&n&+ro such &+La&n&+wn extent th&+bat it is impossible to &+wsee what the subject of the
&+Lp&n&+rainting &n&+wonce was.  B&+beyond the plaster is &+wthe cracked stone of the ceiling.
&+LI&+Rn the v&+Le&n&+wry center of t&+bhe chamber is a l&+wow circular basin, in the center
&+Lof which &n&+wis a chipped and broken marble statue of a leaping dolphin.  It
&+wlooks to have once been a fountain, but no water runs now; instead, stagnant
&+wgreen liquid pools just above the lip of the basin.  Southwest of the fountain
&+wa large fire burns in a rough firepit built with debris, providing dim light
&+wfor the chamber.

&+Wperhaps five meters &n&+wwide and three meters tall,&+L opens in the center of the

&+wShaman's Guest Cave&n~
&+w   This roughly circular cavern is brightly illuminated by a large bonfire
&+wburning in the center of the room.  A very large pile of tree trunks and
&+wbranches has been put aside for fuel, filling the northern end portion of
&+wthis chamber.  A portion of the southern wall has been smoothed, and
&+wprimitive-looking pictures and signs have been scratched into it.&n

&+G   Heaped in the center of th&n&+cis small cavern is a pile seemingly composed
&+Yof equal parts ruined furnitu&n&+mre, household implements, decorations, and
&+yrandom debris.  Tapestries of&+G conflicting design and orientation have been
&+wpoorly attached to all the wa&+blls of the chamber and look none too good for
&+rwear.  A delicate gold chain &+Chas been affixed to the center of the ceiling
&+Bby a crude iron spike.  Upon &n&+gthe end of the chain, a spherical lamp glows
&+Lwith a kaleidoscope of changi&+Rng colors, adding the final mad touch to the
&+wscene.

&+BDanele's Wall&n~
&+c   On the side inner wall of skull city an etching/painting has been worked
&+con here.  It depicts various &+Rsymbols&n&+c, &+ycreatures&+c, and a &+Wbeautiful woman
&+cholding some &+rdemonic child&+c.  &+LWriting&n&+c has also been carved into the walls
&+cusing a small hammer and chisel.  Each is as arcane but somehow familiar
&+cas the next.&n

E
symbol symbols~
&+w   Some are arcane symbols of necromancy it appears.  Another appears as a
&+Ggreen devil face with horns.&n&+w  Yet another a &+Wwhite skull&n&+w with &+Lblack flames
&+wemitting from the top of the skull.  A &+Ywand of golden light&n&+w shines brightly
&+win one corner.  Each symbol has been randomly painted on the wall.  The
&+wmost predominate picture is one of a great &+Yglowing sphere&n&+w filled with faces.
&+wOnly suffering can be seen in each face as one draws closer for a better,
&+wmore detailed view of the image.&n
~
E
creature creatures~
&+w   The creatures are painted tiny in comparison to other designs on the wall.
&+wA hidious &+Lzombie&n&+w, a gastly form of &+Wmist&n&+w, a &+Ldragon&n&+w are all portrayed in
&+wvarious spots.&n
~
E
beautiful woman~
&+w   She is dressed in a commoner's clothes but is very attractive.  She looks
&+wworried in the painting as she is also holding a child.  Ths child, though,
&+whas two small horns on the top of his head.&n
~
E
demonic child~
&+w   This child is roughly about the age of four or five human years.  He is of
&+wnormal appearance save for his horns.  They jut out slightly on his forehead
&+wabout at the hairline.  Even though his appearance is unusual and possibly
&+wdemonic in nature, he has a look of innocence.  The human woman seems to be
&+wholding the child, protecting it from harm.&n
~
E
writing~
&+wThe writing reads as follows...
&n
&+L   You've left and left and found my tomb
&+L   and now your soul will die.
&n
&+wOn another spot it reads...
&n
&+L   If you find the false,
&+L   You find the true

&+mstuffed with all manner of books.  The southwestern wall is similarly
&+chidden by an overflowing scrollrack.  In front of the scrollrack is a broad
&+mwooden desk, its desktop littered with many &+Wbones&n&+m.  About half the bones
&+care assembled into the back half of an unfamilliar, four footed animal.  The
&+mremaining half of the &+Wbones&n&+m are set aside, almost like puzzle pieces waiting
&+cto be assembled.&n

&+y   An abuncance of strange scents, not all of them pleasant, assaults you
&+Las you peer into this chamber.  Every wall contains sturdy shelves, and all
&+yof the available floor space is taken up by wooden tables.  The shelves
&+Lalong the north wall are filled to overflowing with tomes and scrolls.  The
&+yremaining shelves are stuffed with all manner of glass vials, bottles, and
&+Ljars that seemingly contain a very wide variety of substances.  The tables
&+ysimilarly hold a vast array of strange items.  The central table contains a
&+Llarge open book and sinister looking metal tools and needles strewn around
&+ya metal platter.  The platter contains a mostly dissected cat, so it is
&+Lparticularly unsettling when the &n&+wfeline&+L suddenly gives voice to a tortured
&+ymewling.&n

&+wMoil, The City That Waits&n~
&+w   A vast roof of rolling &+Lblack clouds&n&+w hangs above, periodically limned with
&+wa silent &+Welectrical discharges&n&+w of unimaginable magnitude.  Spread out below
&+wthis ominous skyscape is a Promethean city of slender towers, thrusting up
&+wfrom an impenetrable &+Labyss of darkness&n&+w below.  The tower bases are hidden
&+win absolute &+Lblackness&n&+w below, almost as if they were erected upon the darkness
&+witself.  The heights of the spires are rounded, sleek, and enigmatic con-
&+wstructions of stone a&+ynd metal, repeatedly &+willuminated by the actinic light-
&+wning play above.  Thi&+yn spans and fragile b&+wridges connect many of the slender
&+wtowers at various lev&+yels in a mazelike arr&+way.  One stands upon one of these
&+wspans of black metal,&+y equidustantly suspen&+wded between three unlighted spires.
&+wAn obelisk of rusted &+yiron stands before yo&+wu, bearing a lengthy inscription.
&+wA thin layer of hoarf&+yrost coats absolutely&+w everything, and your breath steams
&+win the frigid air.&n

&+r     Mealdrun is impressed; you now stand under the
&+r     darkling sky that most never dreamt of.  Your
&+r     only path is forward through this crumbling
&+r     demiplane of broken piety.  The journey shall task
&+r     you to your mortal limits.  However, this verse
&+r     may help you on your way to me within the
&+r     Void, where you shall receive a fitting prize for
&+r     your persistence.
&n
&n
&+y     This City That Waits was the city of Moil
&+y     Where dreams truly died, but bodies yet toil
&+y     In slumber unrelenting they lie yet in wait
&+y     Biding their time to seal your fate.
&n
&+y     Discovery of the void and my Fortress within
&+y     Demands exploration through peril again.
&+y     Find amid towers degenerate the single key
&+y     And resolve the dilemma of problems three.
&n
&+y     Beard the brine dragon in its frozen hollow;
&+y     Remove the Key, avoid its starved swallow.
&+y     Beneath webs of glowing emerald
&+y     Hangs a riddle-box, ripe to be solved.
&n
&+y     A challenge to pass, to search your soul,
&+y     Be thy mortal warrior, mage, or rogue.
&+y     Grasp your fate with consummate care
&+y     For the beast of ignorance will not be fair.
&n
&+y     Each resolution removes one obstacle
&+y     For those who peruse this written oracle:
&+y     The phantom released flies you in fashion
&+y     To my inevitable Fortress of Conclusion.

&+C   Where this platform ends only nothingness begins.  The frost covered stone

&+WA Stone Bridge Connecting Two Towers&n~
&+L   The bridge seems very old but sturdy.  The usual signs of wear are not
&+where as nothing that lives survives here.  Once in a while a loose stone
&+wfalls into the darkness below startling one's wits.  Will the bridge faulter
&+wand collapse?  You think perhaps not, and continue.  Feint voices can be
&+Lheard in the distance every so often, or perhaps that is one's imagination.&n

&+wA Tower of Black Ice&n~
&+C   T&+Lhe bridge connecting the spire to the surrounding tower ends on &+Ca small
&+Cland&+Ling built from the same slick, black material as the tower itself.&+C  The
&+Cspire&+L reaches up from the murky obscurity below like a single finger str&+Cetch-
&+Cing&+L vainly for purchace it will never discover.  Unlike the surroundi&+Cng
&+Ctowe&+Lrs, this one is perfectly smooth, almost like a very large but thi&+Cn
&+Ccrysta&+Ll.  It rises to a bitter point far above one's head.
&+C   Th&+Le landing has neither an entrance nor any other means of ingress&+C.  In
&+Cfa&+Lct, one cannot see a single window opening over all the visible su&+Crface
&+Cof th&+Le spire.  From the landing, it appears that a set of steep, narro&+Cw stairs
&+Chas bee&+Ln cut out into the outer wall of the spire, descending down the si&+Cde
&+Cof th&+Le monument toward some questionable destination below.  The far lim&+Cit of
&+Cthe &+Lstairs is lost around the side of the tower.&n

&+WAfflictionaria&n~
&+y   This elongated, pie-shaped room has bare walls, but every three meter area
&+Lof floor space holds a strange device, some two dozen in all.  Each device
&+yis different from the next.  Most of these constructions seem to be designed
&+Lto restrain human-sized creatures so that some sort of infernal rig can be
&+yconnected to them.  Some devices in the first rank are immediately recog-
&+Lnizable as torture equiptment.  There is a rack for the stretching of limbs,
&+ya table positioned beneath a set of mechanical arms outfitted with various
&+Lrazors and pincers, a steel harness suspended above a fire pit, an iron
&+ymaiden, and a seat fitted with foot, hand, and head-screws.  These items
&+Lrepresent just a few pieces of equiptment of all that is assembled in the
&+ychamber.&n
