   &+yThe fog from the rain forest above has fallen and all gathered in this
&+ysunken hole. The moisture here is incredibly thick, making breathing very
&+ydifficult. All the sounds from the surrounding forest seem to be absorbed
&+yby the dense dirt and rock walls. Through the thick fog, a small entrance
&+ycan be made out. Beady red eyes glare out from within, shifting positions
&+yas they blink.

&+LT&+whe Mo&+Lut&+wh of a M&+Le&+wdium Sized &+cCavern~
   &+yThe inside of the cavern seems ordinary enough. The beady little eyes
&+ywere just harmless bats after all. A warm and soothing draft can be felt
&+yflowing in from the west. Wooden torches have been mounted on the cave's
&+ywalls, many of them extinguished. The ones which aren't are very dim and
&+ybarely light up the entrance.

Insi&+Ld&+we a Medi&+Lum S&+wized &+cCavern~
   &+yThis appears to be some kind of a gathering place. The cavern is spacy
&+ybut not enormous. A small circle of stones rest in the center of the cave
&+ywith ashes in the middle, from a recent camp fire. A lengthy wooden table
&+yruns along the southern wall with benches and stools lined aside it. Four
&+ybook shelves stand side to side in the northeast corner. All of which are
&+yfilled with dust covered journals and old manuscripts. From here the cave
&+ybranches to the west and north.

&+LA S&+mlo&+Lp&+mi&+Lng Tunnel~
   &+yThe cave floor slopes downward to the west. It's very damp and
&+yslippery as well, and there would be a good chance of falling had
&+ysomeone not thoughtfully hammered some stairs into the floor. The
&+ystairs themselves are rough and unpolished, but very well placed.

&+mThe Warm and Cozy Sleeping Quarters~
   &+wThis area is much wider then the tunnels above. Though the ceiling
&+wis low, there's still enough space for a tall human to stand up. Beds
&+wof hay have been spread out all over the floors. There are even a few
&+whammocks supported by the many stalagmites which have formed from the
&+wground. Small gas vents also line the bottom of this cave spewing hot
&+wair that keeps the cave at a very comfortable temperature. There is a
&+wgranite well towards the west wall for when the occupants get thirsty
&+wduring the night.

&+LA &+gB&+cr&+gan&+cchi&+gng &+LTunnel~
   &+yFrom here the tunnel curves sharply to the right. This particular
&+ysection has not been very well looked after. The floors are littered
&+ywith small animal bones left over from past feasts and celebrations.
&+yEven the ceiling is covered with old bat nests. There is a number of
&+yodd drawings and scribbles as well, painted onto the walls with some
&+yorange coloured fruit paste.

wall scribbles~
 &+LThere are many scribbles on the wall, but one of them stands out more
 &+Lthen the others. In large orange letters the words "&+YXANAN SUCKS&+L", are
 &+Lprinted.

&+LA &+wNarrow&+Li&+wn&+Lg T&+wu&+gnn&+wel~
   &+yHere the tunnel continues in from the west leading further east. But
&+ythe north side of this tunnel has been hammered away, to form a sizable
&+yniche that even a few people could fit into.

&+LA &+wNarrow &+LTu&+wn&+Ln&+we&+Ll~
   &+yIt's becoming increasingly more cramped as the tunnel continues. The
&+ylighting here is poor and it's rather hard to keep good footing. To add
&+yonto that, there are hundreds of small pebbles everywhere, just waiting
&+yfor someone to slip on one and break their back.

&+LA &+wNarrow &+LC&+ya&+Lve-in~
   &+cThe tunnel ends here, blocked by a wall of rocks. The cave-in most
&+clikely occured decades ago considering that the rocks have all formed
&+ctogether, almost like a solid blockade. There's also very little head
&+cspace. In fact, the room from floor to ceiling is no more then six or
&+cseven feet in height.

&+LA H&+wa&+Lmmered Out Niche~
   &+cInside this small niche on the side of the tunnel, there is very little
&+cto see. Marks from large, steel hammers are strewn across the walls, floor
&+cand ceiling alike. Many chunks of rock of all sizes also cover the floors.
