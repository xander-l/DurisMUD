&+CA Chilly Portion of the Forest&N~
   This portion of the forest is slightly colder than the surrounding
woods and the trees here a little paler in color. It's almost as if
some unseen force were sapping the very life out of the forest. Small
animals scurry about nervously looking to find food for their stores.
A small trail can just barely be made out here, apparently leading
further into the wildlands of Duris's arctic north.

&+CA Split in the Pathway&N~
   Vague traces of wagon tracks can be seen here as the pathway
reaches a three way split. To the north the path turns toward the west,
heading into the snowy forests visible in the distance. To the south,
the path leads back toward warmer woods, while to the east another
trail leads deeper into the cold northland forest. Some frail
undergrowth is still able to exist this far north but most brush is
apparently unable to stand the rigors of the increasingly cold clime.
Even the trees seem to suffer from the cold, being of a more pale and
scraggly build than most. However, despite the norm here, several trees
have grown to rather enormous proportions...strange.

   The trail abruptly ends in a little clearing containing a small
community of four log cabins. Glancing about the area, the cabins
appear to be deserted and the thick white fog only adds to the eerie
loneliness of this place. Tree stumps can be seen in a couple of places
around the camp, lending evidence to the nature of the camp as a
logging outpost. However, there aren't enough trees missing to have
provided wood for much more than the cabins themselves. Either the fog
is hiding a lot of tree stumps, or something made the life of this camp
VERY short lived. The entrances to two of the cabins can me reached by
going north and there is a path leading east-west around the whole
camp.

&+YIn the Logging Camp&N~
   A foreboding silence hangs over the foggy logging camp, casting
doubts as to whether anything is left alive here. Two of the camp's
cabins are here to the east and west, silhouetted against the backdrop
of the forest's thick, misty fog. The eastern cabin appears to be in
relatively good condition. Made from the sturdy trees of the
surrounding forest, and sealed against foul weather with a mix of pitch
and clay, the cabin looks like a bastion against the forces of nature.
However, the western cabin doesn't look to be in as good a condition.
Deep scratches can be seen in the cabin's crumbling outer walls and its
door lies broken in the entry way.

   For whatever reason, it appears this cabin has escaped the wanton
destruction evident throughout the rest of the logging camp. Paintings
of beautiful nature scenes decorate the walls and there is the faintest
wisp of incense in the air. A fireplace in the northern wall radiates
just enough heat and light to make the cabin cozy and warm. A counter
lies across the far eastern side of the room,  apparently for store
transactions. In front of the counter lies a plush rug, looking soft
for the feet of tired lumberjack customers. With the presence of a
general store, it seems the founders of the camp were intent on a long
stay with a great deal of expansion beyond the few cabins currently
here. Curiously enough, however, no goods for sale seem to be about and
for that matter, no storekeeper!

   Fog covers the floor of the inside of this cabin lending a sense of
gloomy despair to the scene of destruction evident here. The furniture
which once filled the room lies in broken pieces about the floor,
jagged protrusions from the swirl of fog. Curtains for the cabin's only
window lie in ragged tatters on the window sill, kept from blowing away
by the splintered remains of the shutters. All in all, the cabin looks
as though a wild animal was let loose in its midst..to savagely rip
apart the dwelling. Furthermore, from the two rotted corpses in the
north-east corner of the room, the cabin furnishing weren't the only
things ripped apart.

&+YCenter of the Logging Camp&N~
   A foreboding silence hangs over the foggy logging camp, casting
doubts as to whether anything remains alive here. This part of the camp
is well worn and appears to have seen a fair amount of traffic as the
center of the logging camp at one time. To the north can be seen the
outside of a larger log cabin, perhaps three times the size of the
other cabins. From here, no entrance can be seen to the cabin. A worn
path leads both south and west through the camp, while a shed to the
east holds a large amount of stacked firewood.

however, all that remains of the door now are a few shattered pieces.
It seems as though something smashed through the door and proceeded to
wreck the insides of the cabin. Maybe someone or something didn't like
the logging camp being here...a path leads to the east and west through

                            *CAUTION*

Since the tragic death of our beloved comrade, Jork, at the foul fangs
of a timber wolf which he encountered on a walk in these forests, I am
recommending that no one leave the camp alone. The woods around the
camp have not been explored extensively and there may be many wolves
hidden by the fog waiting for easy victims. I am sure we will run any
hostile creatures off as we venture into the forest for lumber, but
until we are certain..stay in the camp as much as is possible.

                                        Sincerely,

   The wide path which leads around most of the logging camp comes to
an abrupt end here. It seems as though this portion of the path wasn't
finished when the camp became abandoned. A couple of tree stumps can be
seen on the path, not yet pulled from the ground. The path continues to
the east, following the back of a large cabin to the south. All other

for the day-to-day activities of the loggers in camp. However, no
horses are to be seen here now. All that lends evidence to horses once
being here are some gnawed bones and piles of horse dung. On the walls
can be seen some saddles and harnesses for the horses which once stayed
here. To the south is the rest of the logging camp.

the base of one of the trees by a fairly new grave.

&+gBranches of a Fallen Tree&N~
   Pale grey branches of the fallen tree are all about, many as large
as small trees themselves. Enhanced by the creepiness of the fog, the
limbs seem to reach out with claws..like the sickly grasp of some
undead creature. Here and there can be seen a dried, dead leaf still
attached to a branch as testimony to its having once been a live and
healthy tree. It is possible to climb the branches higher in to the
boughs of the tree. Also, one could walk along the tree trunk to the
west or climb down the tree to the forest floor.

built here among the tangle of several branches. Most of the nest is
made of small twigs, bits of tree root, and grasses. Here and there can
be seen bits of animal fur, small bones, and pieces of golden string.

&+YA Northern Trail Through a Forest&N~
   The north-south trailway through the forest is suddenly blocked by a
HUGE fallen tree. Travel south shouldn't be a problem but the tree
completely blocks the trail to the north. However, it looks as though
some previous explorer or tradesman was undaunted as there are several
hand and foot holds painstakingly carved into the tree trunk which
should allow climbing up onto the rounded trunk. When the tree fell, it
smashed the wall of logs on the east side of the trail. Through the gap
can be seen more forest, enshrouded in a thick mist. Travel is possible
through the gap across the tree, while to the west lies more forest
open to travel. South follows the trail and up is the fallen tree trunk.

enough dirt to create a small crater in the forest floor. Tendrils of

attesting to the occupancy of the burrow by some creature. Furthermore,

springs which bubble forth from the ground. Little wisps of mist rise
from cracks in the rock as the warm water meets the cooler forest air,
creating a mist of fog which greatly reduces visibility here. Spread by
the northern winds, these springs bellow forth enough fog to keep the
entire forest cloaked in a haze of mist. The forest lies in all

proportions. Many specimens are more than ten feet wide, with their
boughs lost to sight in the depths of the snow white foggy mist. A cold
wind howls through the trees occasionally, ripping the wet fog about in
a vortex of chills. Then sometimes, the howls are not from the wind but
rather from something hidden within the depths of the fog. The forest
continues in all directions.

&+BBubbling Spring in the Forest&N~
   The trees of the forest thin some here as the ground becomes more
rocky. Yet, the fog is incredibly thick here due to a multitude of warm
springs which bubble forth from the ground. Little wisps of mist rise
from cracks in the rock as the warm water meets the cooler forest air,
creating a mist of fog which greatly reduces visibility here. Spread by
the northern winds, these springs bellow forth enough fog to keep the
entire forest cloaked in a haze of mist. The forest lies in all

fallen trees and water carried debris. Roots still protrude from the

mingled with the roots. It looks as though the erosion of the stream
has washed away enough muck to allow sight of a shriveled hand or two.

none-the-less. The stream continues to the north, while a hollow under

the hollow, a litter of bones can be seen half buried in the mire of

of rotting flesh would give away the presence of the corpses under the

   Through the dense fog, the ground suddenly gives way to a shallow
gully two or three feet deep. Down the middle of the gully runs a small
stream only a few feet wide. Mud and leaves make the stream murky and
its depth is not determinable without probing. The stream flows
sluggishly from north to south carrying leaves and branches from the
trees downstream. Roots of the huge forest trees often protrude from
the stream's banks and provide good hand holds for anyone climbing down
to the stream itself or up the banks.

   A narrow trail cuts through the thick forest as it heads east and
west. Huge ash-grey trees block travel more than a few feet off of the
path to either side. Fallen leaves and broken branches litter the path
and it appears to have been unused for quite some time. Some frail
undergrowth attempts to gain headway around the path, but luckily the
colder clime inhibits it enough to keep the trail clear despite a lack
of use. Other than an occasional rustle of a dried leaf, the forest is

did a damn good job for it would take ages to hack through or ram down.
Other than the wall, the area is similar to the surrounding path...

placed within inches of each other -a strong barrier indeed. Off to the

&+YInside a Large Cavern&N~
   This huge cavern is over a hundred feet in diameter and nearly forty
feet tall. Along the rough ceiling are found a few stalactites but
suspiciously, the floor lacks any stalagmites and is in fact very
smooth. Along the western wall of the cavern is a niche where a large
fire has been built, taking away the chill created by the damp fog of
the cave. Near the fire is a stack of logs and several pallets made of
animal furs. Three huge silver pots are stacked against the north wall
and covered by thick tarps of animal hide. Passages thirty feet high
and wide lead off to the east and north, while up a few rocks to the
south is the outside cliffs. The rough ceiling of the cave lies high
above.

&+YA Rocky Passageway&N~
   A natural tunnel in the rock of these underground caves winds its
way along to the north and south. Rough stone makes up the sides and
ceiling of the passage, while the floor is fairly worn. High on the
sides of the passage are iron sconces with enormous torches which
provide a faint light to the dank tunnel. To both the north and south,
the passage opens up into large caves.

   A cozy cave, lined with dozens of piles of huge animal furs, opens
up here from the southern rocky passageway. Several animal heads (a
caribou, a winter wolf, a few timber wolves, and a huge bear) are
tacked onto the cavern wall, apparently as hunting trophies of the
resident. Also displayed on the walls of the chamber are a half-dozen
spears and war clubs of giant size. Enormous torches burn in wall
sconces providing a dim light for the cave. In addition to the torches,
a wall niche provides a spot for a blazing fire to warm and light the
cave when desired. The remains of some recent meal lie scattered about
one of the piles of fur.

&+YA Rocky Passageway&N~
   This passage looks to be of natural origins and is about thirty feet
wide and high. Rough rocky walls make up the passage's sides and roof,
while the floor is well worn from the passage of the giants. The fog
simply will not go away and it swirls about the floor a few inches
deep. On the sides of the passage are sconces with enormous torches
which provide the area with light. To the east, the passage continues
on, while to the west the way opens into a huge cavern.

&+YSide Cavern Storage Area&N~
   This is a small cave off to the south side of a rocky passage. It
looks as though the giants have made this their storage room . Huge
iron rods have been driven into the stone walls about twenty feet off
of the ground. On top of these rods are thick planks of wood, acting
as shelves to hold supplies for the giants: a couple of crates with
tightly closed lids, four silver pots covered by tarps, a stack of
wooden spears bound with hide strips,several large sacks, and a
metallic box holding tools and more. To augment the goods on the shelves,
there are quite a few things stacked on the floor of the room as well.
   Against the far wall of the cave are stacked dozens of more crates,
perhaps stolen from some passing travelers or traded for with other
humanoids. Other than the crates, there are piles of rocks, wooden clubs,
and scraps of leather armor for use in warfare. Hanging from hooks in
the ceiling are the corpses of four wolves. The only exit from the cave
is back through the wooden gate into the passageway.

&+YA Bend in the Rocky Passage&N~
    The natural passageway comes to a bend here as it winds its way
along. At points along both walls, torch sconces have been placed to
hold gigantic torches which light the area. Fog drifts along the floor,
blown by a breeze from the north which makes it swirl about the feet.
Also from the north come sounds of intermittent crashes, like the
rumblings of an avalanche? The stone passageway also continues to the

&+CA Gigantic Fog Filled Cavern&N~
   A gigantic cavern, nearly two-hundred feet in diameter and fifty
feet high, opens up here. A maze of stalagmites and stalactites disrupt
the field of vision with pillars of rock. Further debilitating sight
is a fog which rises from a small underground pond in the north part of
the cave. Two openings high in the rocky walls lead outside and let a
cold wind into the cavern. There is also a large passageway leading out
of the cavern to the south.
  It seems as though this place is used for some kind of rock throwing
contest by the giants of the area as there are many large piles of
rocks about the cave. Occasionally, a boulder or two will fall from a
pile and make a dramatically loud CRASH! Lots of indentions are in the
sandy floor of the cave from the impact of thrown and crashing
boulders.

&+BBeside a Foggy Underground Pond&N~
   A small pond is apparently the source for all of the fog in the
cave. Cold air from the openings above rushes over the pond, causing
its warm water to rise in a vast amount of mist. The pond is probably
fed by some warm underground springs to help create the potential for
so much fog. Through the high opening in the cave wall, a snowy
mountain range can be seen. Back to the south is the remainder of this
foggy cavern.

&+YA Cramped Split in the Floor&N~
   The rock of the caverns above has split to open up a very cramped
tunnel through the stone. Just barely large enough for a troll or ogre
to squeeze down, the slit is well to small for the immense fog giants
to get into. It seems as though a colony of rats has used this to their
advantage as squeals echo from all about. Stealing food from the giants
above, and making a lair somewhere in these cramped tunnels would be
ideal for the rodents. A crack in the stone leads off to the east,
while above is the giant's storage room.

of foodstuffs and animal fur lie mixed in with the goo, a home only a
rodent could love. Some patches of strange mosh give the area a dim glow,
just enough to see a few feet.Most non-rats would leave by the exit
tunnel to the north as quick as they could.

&+LPathway of Spears&N~
   Here the huge pale trees have grown together to form a tight canopy
over and around a small pathway of glassy black stones. The stones are
placed in strange intricate patterns on the forest floor which may be
runes of some sort, perhaps to invoke some primitive protection spell
over the area. On the sides of the path, huge ashen spears are lined up
with their shafts stuck in the ground. Shriveled human heads are
impaled on many of the spear points. Gazing out onto the path of stones
with rotting eyes, the heads are a creepy portrait of a sick mind and a
vicious killer. Someone has lit incense in some of the older heads and
it's sickly sweet smell makes breathing difficult as it mixes with the
wisps of mist to form a grey fog.
  The path of stones leads further to the west, while there is a gap in
the lining of spears to the north where the forest may be entered. The
canopy of thick trees effectively blocks travel to the south and east.

   The pathway of blackened stones ends in the midst of a gloomy
clearing, enshrouded in more of the ashen grey fog of this forest.
Silhouetted in the background, near the edges of the clearing, are
totem poles with huge carvings of wild beasts. Mystic runes surround
the carvings on the totem poles and attest to the power of nature here.
Hanging from these poles are strings of beads and feathers, pots of
sickly sweet incense, and many human skulls. The whole atmosphere here
is of a primitive barbaric culture which focuses on the worship of
animals and their power. The only exit is back to the east along the
