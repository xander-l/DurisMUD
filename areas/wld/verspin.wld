&+bnone the less breathtaking. Cold clear water spits out of the many dragon
&+bheads, their eyes with &+rred&+b rubies, and their teeth with &+ygold&+b. Many people
&+bflock about, almost none taking notice to the fountain. Sounds from the
&+bwestern market can be heard, along with those of the circus of Verspin.

&+LA Dark Alley~
&+L   This alley in Verspin is the only place that seems to inspire fear. The
&+Lsound of rats scutter about, and motion can be sensed but not seen. The
&+Lsmell of garbage and scat are faint but present. Bums and criminals seem
&+Lto inhabit this area as a frequent, and perhaps the most disturbing thing
&+Lis the graffiti of what appears to be the gang-sign of the Bloodhawks.

&+Ythe corner, ready to hold all the entertainment seekers around. Large stalls
&+Yfilled with water and hay for the animals are placed around the main circle

&+mwith dust and grime. Smells of vials and potions are in the air, as are
&+mthe sounds of magic and spellcasting. One could find a great deal of some
