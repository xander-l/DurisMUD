&+Lof these mountain heights.  A constant whistling chill blows
&+Lthrough the air, drying out the mountain winds with a chilling

&+LA Dark Chamber~
   &+LAlthough the entire forge city of Alatorin is quite dark, this
&+Lparticular chamber seems to be utterly flooded with a carpet of
&+Lblackness.  It is very difficult to see other forms in this room,
&+Las well as the surrounding furniture, if any.  Ones stealth senses
&+Lare definitely heightened in this reclusive chamber.

&+YEntrance to the &+RCouncil of War~
   &+YThis large chamber is ported by a huge arch made up of face-to-
&+Yface duergar and mountain dwarves, holding above their heads a
&+Ybattle-hammer and an axe accordingly in constant struggle.  This
&+Ychamber opens up from several large, wide steps into the War
&+YChamber of Alatorin, east of here.  This chamber serves as the
&+Ypivotal location for the movement of the shield dwarf army and
&+Yabove all else, the protection of the Alatorians.

&+CT&+Gh&+Ce &+CPools &+Go&+Cf &+GForesight&N~
   &+GThese misty pools move like water in slow-motion, tide-less
&+Gand magical.  A faint green haze settles just above the waters
&+Gof these pools.  Occasionally, the waters may churn with energy
&+Gcausing an actual &+Wfountain&+G to appear.  These pools rest
&+Gdeep within the Caverns of Time in Alatorin, an unmined and
&+Gnatural portion of the city that has been preserved for its
&+Gmagical, natural essence.

&+LA &+mTunnel&+L of &+mRu&+Mn&+mes&+L and &+YTime&N~
   &+LThis tunnels is scrolled with runes and markings of Time and the
&+Lcosmos.  Leading east under a runed arch are the Caverns of Time,
&+Lwhile further west leads to an uncharacteristic spiral staircase.
&+LAs most of the steps in Alatorin are flat and broad, this staircases
&+Lspiral format suggests that it may have been crafted by non-dwarven
&+Lhands.  Nevertheless, this mystic tunnel leads west into the Mystic Ward.

   &+LThis stone staircase is quite wide and very sturdy.  Although
&+Lsized for and crafted by a dwarf, these stairs are also sufficient
&+Lfor any sized humanoid.  Along the walls of this portion of the
&+Lstairs, as well as the others, hang occasional paintings of Mithril
&+LHall, Berronar Truesilver, and other fables of their short-raced
&+Llineage.

&+LBottom of a Dark &N&+mMithril Staircase~
   &+LThis dark staircase leads deep within the bowels of &N&+cShanat Citadel&+L.  The
&+Lfloor is carpeted with a thick fur over mithril-blocked steps.  There are torch
&+Lsconces ever-so-often on the mithril walls leading deeper and more and more sparse

&+Lformed out of the natural cavernous deep of Lower Shanatar.  This naturally-
&+Lformed cavern is full of churning &+Rl&N&+ra&+Rv&N&+ra&+L, with a few small

bar around in, behind which dwarves disperse huge racks of lamb, mead, ram, boar,
and other favorites to their customers.  On the south wall of the &+cHammer &Nand &+WShield
is the bar itself, containing two huge shelves of exotic liquors.  Huge barrels of
dwarven ale sit atop the bar in the corners, allowing dwarves easy access to their
favorite brews.  Numerous wooden seats and tables are placed periodically around the
tavern, often filled by the hearty regulars who have just finished their hard days of
work with the Alatorin military.  On the northwestern corner of the tavern, a huge
staircase extends upward to the second level of the establishment, on which there is

&+ghigh travel, as the rocky mountain pass from the east leads into this grassy
&+gclearing.  This grassy clearing sees a cliff face to the west, a brief trail
&+gleading down the hill branching off to the north - where the terrain descends
&+gwalkably gradual.

   &+LThis tall, glorious tower is that of the great gnomish enchanter,
&+LXamora.  It is rumored that this tower was forged by Xamora himself,
&+Lusing the command of earth elementals to form and build the stone of
&+Lthe structure, with water and air elementals to saturate the earth.
&+LAll around are small shelves filled with strange oddities, from candles
&+Lburning odd flames over cursed skulls to fizzing elixirs.  This atrium
&+Lis very private and quite secretive.  Items are all strewn about
&+Lnearly obsessively, all arranged and placed intentionally around the
&+Lentire tower.  The top of the tower features a chamber with two huge
&+Lportals, while the bottom has a set of strange portals as well.

&+yThe Trapper's &+BKeepers&N~
   &+yThis store, the Trapper's &+BKeepers&N&+y is a set in a small
&+ydug-out niche in the deep undercity rock of Alatorin.  Although
&+ythe shop itself is covered with filth, seperated from the rest of
&+ythe rogue's hideout by a simple curtain, and in general dissaray,
&+ythe &+Ytrap &N&+yselection hanging from the walls and the rotting
&+ywooden stall are of &+Cexquisite&N&+y quality.

&+WThe &+YGolden &nP&+Wear&Nl &+MS&+Yu&+Mi&+Yt&+Me&N~
   &+WThis larger guest chamber of the Golden Pearl is actually directly over
&+Wthe tavern below, and is just as large.  Overlooking the glorious ocean out
&+Wthe western windows, this suite gives a marvelous view of the realms from
&+Wthis vantage point, as well as a glorious view of Shanatar out the eastern
&+Wfront.  A large carpet sits at the very center of this room, on which a large
&+Wbed sits.  A huge closet sits on the wall adjacent to the door.
