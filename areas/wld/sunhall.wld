&+rThe Enormous &+YGates&N &+rBefore a &+YF&+yo&+Yr&+yg&+Yo&+yt&+Yt&+ye&+Yn Pyramid&N~
&+yA long wide stair leads from the hot desert sand towards the huge gates of
&+ythe &+LDark&N &+ySun pyramid. Above the entrance on the massive walls a large image
&+yof an &+LEc&+wli&+Lpse&N &+yis carfully carved. When looking on it, an almost &+rhumming &+ysound
&+yblast the brain with a strange power and &+Ysun&+yrays that slip through the &+LEc&+wli&+Lpse&N
&+yblinds the eyes. The pyramid has an unnatural smooth shape that reflects the
&+Ysun&+ybeams like a mirror during daytime and encloak it in &+Lshadows&N &+yduring night.
&+yThe gate itself is built from pure &+cM&+Ci&+ct&+Ch&+cr&+Ci&+cl&N &+yand an &+cElven &+wSigil &+yprotects the
&+ymagic that has been enchanted into it. The gate has no visible handle or
&+ymechanism, instead it opens magically when a Sp&+Yhi&+ynx nods in the direction of
&+ya soul worthy to enter.&N

&+yA Damp&N &+YTriangular&N &+yHall&N~
&+yThis enormous entrance hall lies inside the pyramid gates. The floor is made
&+yof smooth massive stone and has a large ancient rune of the sun carved into it.
&+yThe walls is decorated with all sorts of strange carvings, written in a long
&+yago forgotten language. In the corners of the hall four huge pillars stands
&+ypreventing the heavy pyramid stones from collapsing and burrying the temple
&+yin sand forever. The hall is filled with dust and when the gates open and let
&+ythe wind into the pyramid, it swirls up into the air and make the hall almost
&+yfoggy. The light that slips into the hall makes a beautiful spectrum as it
&+ybeams through the swirling dust on its way deeper into the darkness.

&+yCenter of the &+YPyramid&N~
&+yThe center of the pyramid is a very peaceful place. The room is enormous,
&+ybut has nothing visible inside it. The floor is made of soft smooth sand that
&+ylook like gold when it reflects the sunrays that stream down from the top of
&+ythe pyramid. A strange sound echoes around the room as the wind blows down
&+ythrough some sort of windpipe high up in the ceiling. In the very center of
&+ythe room there is a small altar where the followers of the sun can make
&+ysmall donations or sacrafice to the sun God. A small passageway leads down
&+yfrom the center of the room to a dark and silent tomb filled with living mist.

&+LA Silent Tomb Filled With&N &+mSwirling&N &+WM&+wi&+Ws&+wt&N~
&+LThe tomb lies under the pyramid and can be reached by using a small passageway.
&+LAlong the walls torches has been fastened to light up the room since no sun
&+Lcan reach down here at any time. It smells old, and a feeling of being with
&+Ldead makes the heart pulsate faster. Old ancient Mummies stands along the
&+Lwalls in everlasting silence collecting dust as the years pass by. An echoing
&+Lsound of dripping water can be heard as the unclean water from the chalice of
&+Ldeath pours over the edge and falls to the cold hard stone floor. The only
&+Lexit from the room is the passageway that leads up to the center of the
&+Lpyramid.&N

&+rA Small &+YGathering&N &+rArea&N~
&+yThis small room is the gathering place for most of the inhabitants of the
&+ypyramid. There are several soft comfortable pillows for the fearsome warriors
&+yto sit and relax on while watching the beautiful harem girls do their fancy
&+ydancing. Small candles put on strategic places make a flickering dim light
&+ythat adds a pleasant feeling to those who are charmed by the strange magic in
&+ythis room. Small carvings are drawn all over the walls and it looks as if
&+ythey are stories of heroic deeds done long ago by the mighty followers of
&+ythe sun. Some sort of inn lies above and an old adventurer is selling supplies
&+yto the north.&N

&+cof the realms. Here you can buy almost all the supply you need to make
&+cjourneys through forests, deserts and even climb the highest mountain. Two

&+ccould have been some sort of cell or cage for some beast or perhaps lions
&+csince there is no door but signs after heavy prison bars. A peaceful resting
&+croom lies to the south filled with large pillows.&N

&+rA &+yDusty &+YInn&N &+rNamed&N &+y'Desert Sand'&N~
&+yThis is the old tavern of the pyramid. This part of the pyramid used to be a
&+ytomb of some sort but the current inhabitants has rebuilt it into a tavern.
&+ySeveral smaller rooms lies further into the inn where the lazy or tired can
&+yrest after battle. The room is filled with sand and dust which the travellers
&+yhave brought into the pyramid on their worn cloaks or boots. A small area
&+yfilled with comfortable pillows lies below the inn.&N

&+yA Sparring &+YArena&N &+yCovered With &+rBlood&N~
&+yA small fighting arena lies here on the second floor of the pyramid. Large
&+yracks containing all sorts of weapons and armors stands along the walls. The
&+yfighting place itself lies a bit lower then the stone benches that has been
&+ycarved out from the pyramid to sit on while watching the furious battles.
&+yAn enormous sign of the divine sun has been carved carefully into the ceiling,
&+ywatching over the combatants with its powerful magic.&N

&+rAn &+yAncient &+rChamber&n &+L-&n &+yShrine &+rof the &+ySun &+YGod&n~
&+LThis is the chamber where to members of the sun go to pray. It is used
&+Lmostly mornings when the sun are still climbing the naked sky, but also
&+Lbefore and after great battles when the warriors and magicians wants to
&+Lsummon courage and pray for the souls they have taken.  The chamber
&+Litself has smooth stone walls constructed in a circular shape. A small
&+Lhole in the center of the ceiling filters streaks of sunlight that
&+Lsomehow directs to a spot on the wall just above the shrine. The faint
&+Llight is causing a large area on the wall to &+Yblaze&+L - the emblem of
&+Lthe &+wDark &+ySun &+Lorder.&n

&+yAn &+rEmpty Hall &+LVeiled in&n &+ySmooth&n &+YSand&n~
&+yThis is an enormous sandstone hall inside the pyramid. The hall is shaped
&+ylike a cube stretching high up into the ancient building. There is nothing
&+yinside the hall but a thin layer of soft smooth sand that almost looks like
&+ysnow. Even the weakest sound is amplified by the greatness of the hall and
&+yechoed between the walls. Small circular holes in the walls near the ceiling
&+ylets in the sun through the cube during daytime, making strange but logical
&+ypatterns on the floor.&n
