&+gThe Southern Forest Of &+GLylrstas~
&+g    The forest starts here growing denser to the south. An occasional
&+gchirp from a nearby bird can be heard. The thick underbrush makes
&+git difficult to walk without stumbling. Some of the smaller trees
&+ghave been cut down pretty recently as the stumps still appear to be
&+gfresh. The forest continues to the south, or west.

&+g    The forest mostly composed of ancient trees and small shrubs continues
&+gon here. An occasional rattle in the underbrush marks the presence of
&+gtimber rattlers. Branches are cut off some of the smaller trees probably
&+gfor some poor adventurer lost and in the need of fire wood. The forest
