&+yA Foul &+LMuddy &+yGrave&N~
&+y   This hideous &+Lmuddy &+ygrave is only sixteen feet across.&N  &+WBones &+yadorn
&+ythe vile ground next to bits of broken &+Lweapons &+yand smashed wooden shields,
&+yremains of warriors slayed by dark minions of the black gods.  A strong stench of
&+Lrotting &+rflesh &+ydominates the air within this diabolical grave.  Runes have
&+ybeen etched into the &+bdamp &+yearthen walls of the tomb.&N

&+yA Stony Tomb&n~
&+y   The walls of this room inside this labyrinth of ages old stone are
&+ycovered with caskets seemingly carved into the walls themselves.  The
&+ydust has settled inches thick on the floor and around the level surfaces
&+yand the air is extremely dry and musty.  The smell of decay wafts
&+ythrough the hallways, as if beckoning life to venture further, through
&+ythe twisted catacombs that act as a long forgotton mausoleum of ages
&+ypast.&n

&+yA Passage Through the Catacombs&n~
&+y   With half-burnt torches casting only enough light to spread ghastly
&+yshadows the passageway continues onwards here, through the halls of the
&+ycenturies long dead, entombed and embalmed for their enternal rests.
&+yThe old stones that have created these catacombs have stood for longer
&+ythan most people can remember, and though show signs of wear from time
&+ystill continue to make a solid and stable foundation.  With every step
&+ythe layers of dust explode under the feet, obscuring the torch-light
&+yeven further.&n

&+yflourish in this type of space can be seen all throughout the catacombs,
&+yand here, in this room, lies one of the giant nests that spawns them.
&+yHundreds of thousands of the black &+Lbeetles&+y scurry in and around from
&+yall areas of the catacombs, coming and going to the nests, bringing
&+yscavanged food for the queen and the larvae.  The sound of the &+Lbeetles&+y
&+yis nearly enough to drive the stout-hearted mad as the clicking noises
&+ythey create reaches the highest descibles the closer one ventures
&+yto these areas.&n

&+yA Casket Filled Chamber&n~
&+y   In stark contrast to the other rooms in the catacombs this room
&+yis quite brightly lit with torches that could only be imbued with
&+ymagic to have illuminated here for so long.  Rows of caskets line
&+ythe floor of the chamber, with some defiled from previous adventures,
&+yleaving the bones of the deceased scattered thoughtlessly tossed
&+yabout the ground, though even them have laid motionless for so long
&+yan inch of dust has settled.  Other caskets still remain sealed, the
&+ystone covers looking as heavy and as difficult to lift as a sleeping
&+yOgre.  The rank smell of ages of decay is as incredibly strong as it
&+yis foul.&n

&+yA &+LCavernous&+y Chamber&n~
&+y   The claustrophic-inducing hallways of the catacombs end here abrubtly
&+yas the stone walls expand and open up into a massive, domed-ceiling room.
&+yAs scarab beetles scurry beneath the feet, causing little dust clouds
&+yto float up in the darkness, several large statues can be seen.  The
&+ystatues of royalty from ages past, some depicted as monsterous demons
&+yand others as beautiful goddesses.  The odd statue has itself been
&+yworn down with time, the stone that created it giving away to age and
&+ybecoming brittle.  The slightest touch can cause loose stones to break
&+yaway and fall to the floor, echoing alarming in the large room, breaking
&+ythe eerie silence.&n

&+yAn Aged Hallway&n~
&+y   The stony catacombs stretch onwards, through these endless hallways
&+yand chambers with the dim light and eerie silence.  Here, the walls have
&+ybeen painted with several hiroglyphics, crude pictures drawn so long ago
&+ythat very few in todays age could decipher them.  The most impressive
&+ypicture is that of a large eye, taking up most of the wall, intended,
&+ymost likely to act as a sort of a warning for those unwelcome in these
&+yhallowed halls.  A long dead corpse, decomposed so much that even the
&+ybones themselves have become brittle, rests against the wall, proving
&+ythat seemingly the picture of the eye did not prove to be a very good
&+ywarning at all.&n

&+yAn Old Fountain&n~
&+y   The stony, dust-laden hallways open up here just enough to give
&+yample room for what must have been once a magnificent fountain.  The
&+yfountain itself has long since dried up, but the statue in the center
&+yand the pictures carved into the base must once have been awe inspiring,
&+ythough now it appears to be nothing more than a small nest for the
&+ylocal &+Lscarab beetles&+y.  The heavy musty smell countinues to fill the
&+ynostrils, and the quiet is only broken by the clicking of the &+Lscarabs&+y,
&+yor a shifting rock falling somewhere in the distance creating a dim,
&+yhushed, echo.&n
