&+LAn Abandoned Storefront&N~
   Many, many years ago, this store served hundreds of Tharnadian citizens
on a daily basis.  Amidst the trash and rubble, it's now impossible to tell
what was once sold here.  There are piles of empty boxes, as well as
construction material strewn about, none of it is of any value.  The air
is dry and very dusty.

&+LA Pathway Under the Arch&n~
   The rubble of stones, and other building material used as part of
the city's walls is all around this area.  Elegant onyx menhirs once
lined this path, but they are all now smashed and worthless.  East
leads back into Tharnadia proper. West heads into the mesa.  One
can see the movement of humanoids within the twin keeps.

The Road Leading From the Devastated Ruins of Tharnadia~
   Once traveled by thousands of individuals on a daily basis, the road
leading from Tharnadia now lies in ruins and is completely desolate.  The
amount of trash and rubble makes it impossible for anything other than foot
traffic. From here, it is plainly evident how utterly devastated Tharnadia
is.  The sight is enough to make anyone who remembers Tharnadia's former
glory ill. Rubble makes travel impossible anywhere but east and west. The
ruined city gates lie immediately to the west.

   Tharnadia's walls, gates and towers were built by master craftsmen, and
it shows. Despite years of neglect, the gates and stonework appears as it did
when Tharnadia was the center of the world.  Two huge ironbound gates mark the
eastern entrance to Tharnadia here, standing twenty feet high, and surrounded
by two fifty foot stone towers.  Oddly, the gates remain in a 3/4 open
position. The pulley system that once opened and closed the gates on a daily
basis is damaged beyond repair.  Everything else -- the buildings and other
structures near the gates, lies in ruins.  Rubble and trash is everywhere. It
is eerily silent.  A dirt road leads away to the east and away from the city.

   One could never tell this building was once a center of commerce in

intact, everything has since been looted over the decades.  Wooden beams

completely rotted away.  There is a very real possibility this building
could collapse at any moment.  One is advised to leave southwards to the

into the fissure.  The designwork of the staircase is spectacular,

the wealthiest of nobles.  When the fissure opened, the invaders used
an immensely powerful illusion to create this staircase so that they
could charge into the city.  The illusion was so strong, that it
remains in effect to this day, even though the mages that
created it are long dead.

&+yRoad beneath the Gate Tower&n~
   This moderately sized road runs along the inner edge of the high city walls
here, paved with large flat slabs of &+Lgranite&+w.  When &+LLord &+cKay&+Cno&+Wr&+w had the city
constructed he made sure it was protected, even though the twin keeps were
built as the last mainstay of defense for the people.  The defensive walls
rise up nearly fifty feet here, and are almost ten feet thick.  Indeed, the
walls offered a mighty defense, yet were of no value when the invaders
poured through from beneath the city.  All around this area is ruins and
devastation.  Access to a ruined guard tower is found upwards.

&+LBefore a Gothic Cathedral&N~
   Once perfectly groomed and dark green grass lined this path, but it is now
utterly devoid of life.  Long &+Lblack&n blocks of marble have been set in the
ground here, perfectly smooth and obviously well cared for which is very odd
given the surroundings.  At the end of the pathway stands a
magnificent-looking structure, nearly as high as the city walls that surround
it, which is designed like a huge gothic &+Lcathedral&n.  Despite the devastation
around it, the cathedral appears to be in fairly good condition, which is very
unsettling.  It is silent and the air seems frozen.  One is left with an
overwhelming sense of fear. Just above the arched doorway is an upside-down
ankh.  The &+Wdoors&N are shut and locked.  A &+ybronze&N plaque has

have all collapsed into the trading area making travel too hazardous for

&+LThe Great Fountain&+L of &+WTharnadia&+L, Now in Ruins&N~
   Once the center of the world, this landmark lies in total ruins.  When the
invaders conquered the city, they made a point of tearing down the fountain
in an elaborate, ceremonial way to demoralize its former occupants.
While the base is largely intact, all of the sculptures and other
stonework inside of it were smashed apart.  The once inviting water that
ran through the fountain has been replaced by a filthy, black sludge.
&+LTharnadian Way&n runs west of here, while to the east it intersects
with &+LKeats street&+w.  The remains of a two story building rises to
the south of here, its sides covered in rot and grime.  From here, you
can see the high city walls in all directions off in the distance.

&+LThe Devastated Remains of &+WThe &+BOgre's Foot &+WInn&N~
   The Ogre's Foot Inn was once famous for being _the_ place to find the most
powerful adventurers in Tharnadia.  The invaders made a point of razing this
building with haste to catch the city's most powerful warriors
off guard.  When they hit it, they hit it hard -- this building is a complete
disaster.  It is burnt black from powerful magic, and nothing but trash and
rubble remains.  The staircase that once led up into the rest of the inn has
collapsed, and travel upwards is impossible.  This building may be of interest
to a Tharnadian historian, but not to an adventurer.  The only exit is
northwards, out of the inn.

&+LTharnadian Way&n~
   This street was once highly traveled and famous, but is now
completely ruined and desolate. Smashed &+Lonyx&+w menhirs and
other rubble lie strewn about here, making travel precarious. Small
&+Rcrimson&+w cobblestones make up the roadway, each fitted with the
dwarven tongue and groove system.  Much of the original design-work is
irreparably damaged, however, due to ages of neglect. This broad avenue
runs through the center of &+WTharnadia&+w, continuing to the east and
west of here. One may enter a storefront to the north.  The remains of
a massive fountain are found eastwards.

&+LAn Arch Before the Keeps&n~
   An ancient and damaged &+Lbloodstone&+w arch leads through the city's
defensive wall, joining a path that leads up the steep mesa to the first of
the twin keeps. The &+rcrimson&N cobblestones of the Grand Tharnadian Way
mix with the larger &+ysienna&N-colored stones of the western wall road,
both to the north and south. Most of the once attractive design work of the
stones has been irreparably damaged by neglect however. The Grand Tharnadian
Way heads back to the east through the center of Tharnadia.  The twin keeps
can be seen off in the distance.  It's a bit unsettling to see that they
remain in good condition.  Who or what occupies the twin keeps now?

   Ground zero.  Wall road, and the city wall itself, remain in relatively

however, and the path gives way to a shocking 100+ foot fall to the
fissure below.  It was through this magically created fissure that the
invaders poured through, catching everyone inside the city off guard.  The
area is completely devoid of life -- undoubtedly from the magical weapons
used extensively during the invasion.  As with the rest of the city proper,
it is eerily silent.  Visiting a city that's recently been devastated by a
nuclear weapon makes for an accurate modern-day analogy of what is seen here.

&+LAn Abandoned Storefront&N~
   Many, many years ago, this store served hundreds of Tharnadian citizens
on a daily basis.  Amidst the trash and rubble, it's now impossible to tell
what was once sold here.  There are piles of empty boxes, as well as
construction material strewn about, none of it is of any value.  The air
is dry and very dusty.

roof is completely missing; ripped away by some great power.  The windows
permit a complete view of Tharnadia -- it looks horrible.  One feels quite
vulnerable standing in this room, as if he or she could be sniped by a hidden
archer from another part of the city.

&+yA Bend in the Wall Road&n~
   This moderately sized road runs along the inner edge of the high city walls
here, paved with large flat slabs of &+Lgranite&+w.  When &+LLord &+cKay&+Cno&+Wr&+w had the city
constructed he made sure it was protected, even though the twin keeps were
built as the last mainstay of defense for the people.  The defensive walls
rise up nearly fifty feet here, and are almost ten feet thick.  Indeed, the
walls offered a mighty defense, yet were of no value when the invaders
poured through from beneath the city.  All around this area is ruins and
devastation.

The Road Leading From the Devastated Ruins of Tharnadia~
   Once traveled by thousands of individuals on a daily basis, the road
leading from Tharnadia now lies in ruins and is completely desolate.  The
amount of trash and rubble makes it impossible for anything other than foot
traffic. From here, it is plainly evident how utterly devastated Tharnadia
is.  The sight is enough to make anyone who remembers Tharnadia's former

&+LAdmist the R&+yu&+Lb&+yb&+Ll&+ye &+Lof a Massive &+rM&+Re&+rte&+Ro&+rr&n~
   Once travelled by thousands of individuals on a daily basis, the road
leading from Tharnadia now lies in ruins and is completely desolate.  The
amount of trash and rubble makes it impossible for anything other than foot
traffic. From here, it is plainly evident how utterly devastated Tharnadia
is.  The sight is enough to make anyone who remembers Tharnadia's former
glory ill. Rubble makes travel impossible anywhere but east and west.

&+LA Back Room in a Grubby Tavern&N~
   Perhaps this small room was used for storage at one time.  In any
event, it's now completely deserted.  Worthless trash lay strewn about.
The air smells mouldy from a lack of ventilation.  The only exit is to
the north, back into the grubby tavern.  Staying in this room for long
feels unsafe.

&+YDeep Inside the Fissure&N~
   Nowhere to go but up -- the tunnel of living rock ends here.  The
lack of handholds prevents travel upwards by any means other than
magical.  It is a long way up indeed, as light from the surface is
barely visible from here.  East leads into the tunnel of living rock.

&+yA Tunnel of Living Rock&N~
   This is a tunnel with unpolished rock lining the walls, ceiling and
floor.  It's different, however.  The rock is warm to the touch.  It
even appears to move slightly -- expanding and contracting as if it were
breathing.  Other than this, there is little else of interest here.  The
tunnel ends westwards, but continues to the east.

&+LA Community &+yShit&+Lhouse&N~
   While unused for centuries, this building is identifiable as such by
the ten long boxes, each cut with ten holes.  At one time, these boxes
accomodated hundreds of flexing bottoms doing what they did best.  As
one can imagine, there is nothing of value here.  One may exit to the
south.
