&+LLost in the Grey Fog&n~
&+L   A dense grey fog spreads in all directions, reducing sight radius to about
&+Lone meter. This fog, unlike the casual one, is dry. And, unlike a smoke, is
&+Llacking any recognizable odour. Shadows move silently behind the wall of fog.
&+LThe ground here is black and charred, and whole place seems to be heavily
&+Laccursed by gods. Thanks to lack of any visible landmarks, it's almost sure
&+Lfor anyone foolish enough to explore the fog to get lost really soon...

&+LThe Web of Unlife&n~
&+L   Far beyond the prime material plane, in the gap between some two of the&n
&+Loutter planes, this unmaterial web hangs from nowhere, endless in dimension&n
&+Land eternal in time. The web got its own consiousness, if this is the proper&n
&+Lword to describe the unlife powers dwelling the infinite miles of its length.&n
&+LIt it awakening. It is awakening for those foolish enough power hungry&n
&+Lmortals who devoted their lives to researching unlife secrets.&n
&+LSooner or later, every powerfull enough adept of necromancy will find out&n
&+Labout the web, and tempted to gain godly powers will planeshift here.&n
&+LBut there's only one true power in the mortal world, and death is its name...&n

&+LLighter Fog&n~
&+L   A dense grey fog spreads in all directions, reducing sight radius to about
&+Lone meter. This fog, unlike the casual one, is dry. And, unlike a smoke, is
&+Llacking any recognizable odour. Shadows move silently behind the wall of fog.
&+LThe ground here is black and charred, and whole place seems to be heavily
&+Laccursed by gods. Thanks to lack of any visible landmarks, it's almost sure
&+Lfor anyone foolish enough to explore the fog to get lost really soon.
&+LIn this very place fog lightens up a bit, allowing to see that in one place,
&+Labout half a meter above the ground, there is a magical portal set.
&+LIt is half-invisible, yet even not seeing it one can be sure it is there, as
&+Lfog behind it folds and shifts when looked through it.
