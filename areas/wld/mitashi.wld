&+G   M&+gi&+Gtas&+gh&+Gi&n &+Lis a wide, sprawling city surrounded by high walls of &+rr&n&+we&n&+rd b&n&+wr&n&+ri&n&+wc&n&+rk&n
&+Land&n g&+rr&n&+wa&N&+ry&n &+wm&n&+ro&n&+wr&n&+rt&n&+wa&n&+rr&n&+L.  The walls are fifteen feet in height and wide enough so
&+Lthat guards can easily keep watch over the countryside by walking along
&+Lthe top.  At equal intervals around the capital city of the &+gJ&+Gad&+ge E&+Gmpir&+ge&n&+L,
&+Lwooden towers rise up above the walls, providing an even higher perch
&+Lfor the vigilant Imperial Guardsmen.  The city gates are made of solid
&+cblue-steel&n &+Land swing easily on well-oiled hinges.  Painted in the middle
&+Lof the gates is the symbol of the &+gJ&+Gad&+ge E&+Gmpir&+ge&n&+L, a bengal tiger crouching
&+Las it moves through a field of reeds.

&+Lfor traffic entering and leaving the city.  Guards dressed in the &+ggr&n&+Gee&n&+gns&n
&+Land &+bb&n&+Blue&n&+bs&n &+Lof the&n &+cImperial Guard&n &+Lpatrol the vicinity, searching for any signs
&+Lof trouble.  More guards stand atop the red brick walls, each carrying a
&+Lshortbow to deal with threats on the ground.  The main city road continues
&+Lto head directly south into the heart of the city and smaller paths
&+Lbranch off to the west and east, following the interior of the city walls.

&+m   A large, flat plaza has been constructed here to be used as a giant,

&+mvendors carry their goods with them, while the larger vendors have wooden

&+mAdding to the confusion is the number of children who run through the crowds,

&+cThe Guards Walk&n~
&+w   This road is used mostly by the soliders of the&n &+cImperial Army&n &+wand the
&+BWatch&n&+w.  It is comprised of brown bricks, roughly square in shape, made out
&+wof a &+ymi&n&+Lx&n&+ytu&n&+Lr&n&+ye&n &+wof&n &+ydirt&n &+wand&n &+Ldark clay&n&+w.  The road is very well maintained and is
&+wwide enough for two wagons to travel along it side-by-side.  Alongside the
&+wroad are the dull, non-descript two-story buildings that belong to the

&+BThe Path of the Winds&n~
&+y   This path of yellow and brown bricks heads west-east and provides a main
&+ypath of travel from the city's docks near the waterfront.  Various small
&+ydomiciles line this road, mostly belonging to the dock workers and their

&+BThe Path of the Winds&n~

&+yThe Merchants Road&n~
&+w   This small path of flat yellow stones leads in a north-south direction,
&+wcreating a link between the road that runs along the city wall and the main
&+wmerchant square.  Two stores flank the ten-foot wide road, one on either
&+wside.  Both are housed in large, nearly identical buildings.  The one on
&+wthe west is some type of perfume store or apothecary.  It's been painted
&+win gaudy shades of &+Rorange&n &+wand&n &+Ggreen&n &+wand looks altogether hideous.  The one
&+won the east is much more subdued, covered in shades of &+bdark blue&n &+wand
&+Cturquoise&n&+w.  It looks to be supply shop for miners or woodsmen.

&+GHengi's Shop of&n &+BCelestrial Wonders&n~
&+B   This amazing room is filled with shelves of trinkets, baubles, and jars
&+Bcontaining fluids of various colors and densities.  Most of the bottles are
&+Bsmall and corked, allowing one to easily sniff the contents by removing the
&+Bcork stopper.  Others are clearly labeled with warning signs about inhaling
&+Bvapors.  Hanging from the ceiling are various wind chimes that tinkle in
&+Bthe slight breeze.  Some sections of the store contain shelves of nothing
&+Bbut small statues and miniatures made of pewter, finely crafted and carved
&+Bto resemble fantastic creatues.  Another section contains pictures that
&+Bhave been chemically etched on glass mirrors of all sizes.

&+yloggers.  There are twelve shelves spread out around the room, along with
&+ya pair of tables located in the middle of the room.  Each of the shelves

&+YThe Horsetraders&n~
&+L   This small shop sits near the main gates of the city, allowing easy
&+Laccess to and from the stableyards that sit behind the shop.  From this
&+Llocation, one can see the small, fenced-in field that sits behind this
&+Lbuilding, along with a full-sized covered stable.  Another storage shed is
&+Llocated inside the fenced off corral, most likely containing feed and other
&+Lgoods for use in taking care of the animals.  There is a strong smell of
&+Lanimals in the air, which is obviously to be expected in a business such
&+Las this one.

&+yThe Stable Yards&n~
&+y   This stableyard and corral serve to house some of the animals for sale
&+yin the Horsetraders shop to the west.  The field is muddy and churned up by
&+ythe exercises of the various animals.  There's some bales of hay and troughs
&+yfull of water for feed, and some short fences for training the horses to
&+yjump obstacles.

&+LA Nameless Side Road&n~
&+L   This path of black and brown bricks heads north-south and provides a side
&+Lpath of travel from the city wall road towards the marketplace.  There is a
&+Lsmall, single story building on the east side of this street, entry provided
&+Lby a single, slided door made of heavy paper held on a bamboo frame.   The
&+Lstruture looks to be some type of business, but it must not be a well-visited
&+Lone based on its location and the tiny amount of traffic on this road.

&+GThe Lady of&n &+gPoison&n~
&+g   This dimly lit shop seems strangely ominous, although there is nothing out
&+gof the ordinary that one can see.  It's a simple store, with no displays
&+gor shelves except for what's behind a long, wooden counter.  Behind that
&+gcounter there are various glass jars filled with liquids of all colors,
&+ga vast array of plants, both alive and dead, and a plethora of vials and
&+gsealed bowls of powders.   Many of the containers have labels on them,
&+gwritten in some code of numbers and letters.

&+L   The&n &+LClan R&n&+wave&n&+Ln&n &+Lbuilding, like the rest of the Clan houses along the
&+LPath of Flowers&n&+L, is laid out like a large square.  The middle of the

&+Lof the building.  From this position, one can either continue to the south
&+Land enter the garden, or use one of the two sliding panel doors to the west
&+Lor east to enter the house.  The garden is roughly fifty feet per side,
&+Lwhile the house is another fifty feet surrounding that.  The structure

&+L   This room serves as a library or study for the Clan.  The room is laid
&+Lout simply, with four chairs spaced around the middle of the room
&+Lsurrounded by eight shelves of books and scrolls, two per wall.  The shelves
&+Lon the south and west walls are slightly small in length, because of the
&+Lsliding wood panelled doors that allow access to this room.  When opened
&+Lthe doors cleverly slide behind a shelf, out of sight.  Windows in the north
&+Land east walls are currently open to the outside environment, but each has
&+La set of folding blinds that can be used to cut off the noise and weather
&+Lof the outside world.

&+LThe beds are hung about three feet off the ground by the sturdy frames,
&+Lallowing room underneath for long, rectangular wooden chests for personal
&+Litems and clothing.  Privacy in the tight quarters is granted somewhat by
&+Lmovable walls made of thick white paper held by the same style of bamboo
&+Lframes.  Some of the paper walls have been decorated by some aspiring
&+Lartist using a brush and black ink.  Sliding wood panelled doors allow
&+Laccess to the room from the north, east, and south.

&+L   Offering a spectacular view of the rest of the Clan house, the main parts

&+Lroom is the only second-story room in this structure.   The room itself
&+Lconsists of four supporting pillars at the corners of the square room
&+Lwhich hold aloft a triangular sloped roof.  The "walls" of the room are
&+Llong blinds of thin wood panels held together by string which can be raised
&+Lup from the floor using pull cords.  This clever arrangement allows the
&+Loccupants to completely remove any of the walls if they wish.  A small round

&+BA Second-Story Meeting Room&n~
&+g   Offering a spectacular view of the rest of the Clan house, the main parts
&+gof the city to the north, and the palace complex to the south, this meeting
&+groom is the only second-story room in this structure.   The room itself

&+Wsurrounded by eight shelves of books and scrolls, two per wall.  The shelves

&+Wmajority of the space in this area that has been set aside for servants.
&+WThe beds are hung about three feet off the ground by the sturdy frames,
&+Wallowing room underneath for long, rectangular wooden chests for personal

&+Wmovable walls made of thick white paper held by the same style of bamboo

&+BA Library&n~
&+B   This room serves as a library or study for the Clan.  The room is laid
&+Bout simply, with four chairs spaced around the middle of the room
&+Bsurrounded by eight shelves of books and scrolls, two per wall.  The shelves
&+Bon the south and west walls are slightly small in length, because of the
&+Bsliding wood panelled doors that allow access to this room.  When opened
&+Bthe doors cleverly slide behind a shelf, out of sight.  Windows in the north
&+Band east walls are currently open to the outside environment, but each has
&+Ba set of folding blinds that can be used to cut off the noise and weather
&+Bof the outside world.

&+BServants Quarters&n~
&+B   Small beds made of cloth suspended used bamboo frames take up the
&+Bmajority of the space in this area that has been set aside for servants.
&+BThe beds are hung about three feet off the ground by the sturdy frames,
&+Ballowing room underneath for long, rectangular wooden chests for personal
&+Bitems and clothing.  Privacy in the tight quarters is granted somewhat by
&+Bmovable walls made of thick white paper held by the same style of bamboo
&+Bframes.  Some of the paper walls have been decorated by some aspiring
&+Bartist using a brush and black ink.  Sliding wood panelled doors allow
&+Baccess to the room from the north, east, and south.

&+w   The&n &+yClan Rat&n &+wbuilding, like the rest of the Clan houses along the
&+RPath of Flowers&n&+w, is laid out like a large square.  The middle of the

&+wof the building.  From this position, one can either continue to the south

&+wor east to enter the house.  The garden is roughly fifty feet per side,
&+wwhile the house is another fifty feet surrounding that.  The structure

&+Btables and chairs have been spaced around the porch area, each made with
&+Bhigh-quality construction and workmanship.  The roof overhead is made from a
&+Bmesh of long, rectangular strips of wood, with small square holes caused
&+Bby the mesh.  It provides adequate shade, but would offer no protection from

&+Bin the far north wall close enough to provide warmth to the bar but far
&+Benough away so that smoke won't bother the patrons there.  A few windows
&+Blook out over a street that runs parallel to the north side of the building.

&+yAn Abandoned Warehouse&n~
&+L   What was once a larger house has been converted into a warehouse of some
&+Lkind.  The interior walls were removed and the windows were boarded up for
&+Lsecurity reasons.  At some time in the past though, it looks like there
&+Lwas a fire or some other disaster.  The only thing that remains here are
&+Lburnt and scarred wooden crates and boxes and cobwebs.  The interior is
&+Lvery dark, which is to be expected since  light can only enter through the
&+Ldoorway.  What is not normal is the temperature, which is cold enough to
&+Lcause one's breath to mist.

&+LAn Abandoned Warehouse&n~
&+L   This was once the basement of the warehouse, but it has fallen into a
&+Ldangerous state of disrepair.  The timbers that support the floor overhead
&+Lare rotted and weakened, sagging in many places, cracked in others.  The
&+Lair in the basement area is practically frigid, at least twenty to thirty
&+Ldegrees lower than the temperature outside.  Very little light manages
&+Lto sneak it's way down to this level of the structure.
