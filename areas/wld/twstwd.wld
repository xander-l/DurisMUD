&+GA Light Forest&N~
   Though the forest isn't thick here, it has a sinister quality to it that
does a very good job of keeping away travelers.  A fairly well-kept road has
been cut through the edge of the forest to the west so that travelers have no
need of stopping, or even traveling through this somewhat sinister place.
Even the animals in the forest here have a strange, twisted quality to them,
a sinister and evil aspect that seems to come from the forest itself.  The
trees are thin here, but the thorny bushes seem to lie in every direction
making travel difficult.  The forest continues to the east where it appears
to get thicker and more threatening, as well as to the north where it begins
to thin a bit.  The road that runs by along the south and west can only be
reached to the west, the southern route has been blocked by a huge, twisted
bloodthorn.

does a very good job of keeping away travelers.  A fairly well-kept road has
been cut through the edge of the forest to the west so that travelers have no
need of stopping, or even traveling through this somewhat sinister place.  It
is hard to imagine what creatures make their homes here.  The bushes and
trees are twisted and bent, full of sharp thorns that make even the heartiest
of travelers wary.  Odd claw marks mark the ground near a rabbit's burrow to
the west, they somehow add to the strange, sinister feel of the forest.  A
road passes by to the west and the forest continues to the south and east
where it begins to thicken.  To the north the brush and trees get much
thinner, though no less threatening.

&+GA Field of Sharp Grass&N~
   Thick brush and tall grasses line the gentle rolling hills that extend to
the north.  Though less threatening than the forest to the south and east,
the grass is razor sharp, quite capable of damaging all but the finest of
armors, and the thick bushes that dot the land have sharp thorns that look
more than ready to pierce the unwary traveler.  A dark and sinister forest
lies is further to the east.  Named the 'Twisted Wood' by adventurers brave
enough to enter it, it is the source of many a bard's tale.  Rumors of great
mansions and horrible beasts, mixed with tales of treasure and death, have
led many foolish travelers into its dark embrace, never to return again.  The
strange grass and bushes here have been cleared away to the west to create a
well-traveled trade route.

   Dense, thorny trees block passage to the open road to the west, but fields
of thick, sharp grasses and small thorny bushes extend in every other
direction.  Though quite large, the trees appear to be nothing more than
thorn bushes that have grown far beyond their normal size.  There is
something about this area though, and the 'Twisted Wood' that it leads to in
the east, a vague feeling of unease and palpable tension add a bite to the
cool breezes that tear across the sharp grasses.  Tales have been told of
mansions, even castles, hidden in the deep forest to the east, some of the
rumors have conviced bold adventurers to enter the tortured darkness, few
have returned.

   Standing nearly a meter in height, the grass here reaches high enough to
cause serious discomfort to even the largest of travelers.  Razor sharp
ridges run along the thin edges of the leaves, and barbed points stick into
clothing and tear off.  Small bushes also dot the land, but they are stunted,
twisted things full of sharp thorns and tightly bunched branches.  There is
little here to attract even the heartiest of adventurers, though the forest
that lies further to the south and east has been rumored to contain vast
treasures and beautiful castles.  Few travelers have returned from the

   Massive hedges of thorny brush rise up here to form a rough border for
this untamed field of sharp grass.  Bearing edges sharp enough to be used as
weapons, the grass has barbed points that stick into clothing and even armor
forcing travelers to fight their way through the fields.  Strange, twisted
animals dart through the grass and thorny bushes, they seem to have evolved a
resistance to the sharp edges, and even an ability to feed on them.  A vast
forest can be seen to the south and east, though the trees aren't tall there
is something dark and sinister about them that can be felt even at this
distance.  Bards' have recounted tales of castles and mansions hidden in the
'Twisted Wood' in dimly lit bars, but it is difficult to find one that has

&+GA Light Forest&N~
   The forest gets much thicker here, the thorny trees barely letting in any
light at all.  Though thicker and more treacherous, it pales beside the
strange trees and brush that can be seen to the east.  Everything here has a
twisted quality to it that makes it seem a bit unreal, a bit otherworldly,
yet far more deadly than one would wish to think about.  Even the creatures
here are strange, almost unrecognizable, yet certainly quite deadly.  It is
hard to imagine anyone, or anything, wanting to be in such a place.  Somehow
though, there are creatures that thrive here, and no place else in the vast
lands of Duris.

&+LWithin a Twisted Wood&N~
   Cries of strange animals weave through the thickly intertwined branches of
the thorny trees that make up the forest.  So little sunlight makes it
through the thick branches that only a few bushes are able to grow.  Despite
the lack of growth, dead branches covered with thorns line the ground making
travel difficult and time consuming.  The forest seems to extend forever, but
is so dark that it is difficult to say for certain.  There isn't even any
moss growing on the tree trunks to help travelers mark their directions.  Dim
lighting makes it difficult to see any of the strange animals that abound
here, but the crackling of the underbrush lets all know that they are there,
and that some of them are quite large.  Rumors tell of lost castles, even
kingdoms, hidden in the forest and it is easy to believe that they may be
true.

&+GA Light Forest&N~
   Thin, but thorny, trees line the area here.  It is almost as if every
tree, no matter what type it may be, has some sort of thorny protection.
Despite the fact that the trees aren't as dense as those further to the east,
they have a sinister, twisted quality to them that is hard to explain.
Though sunlight is able to make its way through the thick branches above,
there are long, dark shadows that could easily conceal fairly large beasts.
Even the animals here are twisted copies of more recognizable beasts.  The
name 'Twisted Wood' given to this area by the bards and adventurers is much
easier to understand when one sees the beginning of the forest.

&+GA Field of Sharp Grass&N~
   Standing nearly a meter in height, the grass here reaches high enough to
cause serious discomfort to even the largest of travelers.  Razor sharp
ridges run along the thin edges of the leaves, and barbed points stick into
clothing and tear off.  Small bushes also dot the land, but they are stunted,
twisted things full of sharp thorns and tightly bunched branches.  There is
little here to attract even the heartiest of adventurers, though the forest
that lies further to the south and east has been rumored to contain vast
treasures and beautiful castles.  Few travelers have returned from the
'Twisted Wood' so the rumors are had to confirm or even deny.

&+GThe Edge of Field of Sharp Grass&N~
   Massive hedges of thorny brush rise up here to form a rough border for
this untamed field of sharp grass.  Bearing edges sharp enough to be used as
weapons, the grass has barbed points that stick into clothing and even armor
forcing travelers to fight their way through the fields.  Strange, twisted
animals dart through the grass and thorny bushes, they seem to have evolved a
resistance to the sharp edges, and even an ability to feed on them.  A vast
forest can be seen to the south and east, though the trees aren't tall there
is something dark and sinister about them that can be felt even at this
distance.  Bards' have recounted tales of castles and mansions hidden in the
'Twisted Wood' in dimly lit bars, but it is difficult to find one that has
truely been there.

&+LDeep in a Twisted Wood&N~
   Short, dense trees make up this strange wood.  A few meters above the
ground the branches lace together to create a dense covering that lets very
little light through.  Dead branches and stubborn, thorny bushes line the
area, making travel difficult.  Trees block out enough light that not much
can grow so the forest can be traveled in almost any direction.  A deep
darkness is everywhere though, adding an ominous element to an already
sinister place.  Bard's tales speak of lost mansions and castles and the
dense thicket makes the tales believable, though not necessarily true.  Odd
animals, twisted representations of what one would normally expect in a
forest, dart through the trees, some silently, some making more noise than a
village of children.  The vague light makes it difficult to see the
creatures, those that are visible, are visible only briefly, leaving the
traveler uneasy at their strangeness.

&+LDeep in a Twisted Wood&N~
   Thorny, twisted trees weave together to create a dense and ominous forest.
Travel is difficult in any direction, but much of the thorny brush is dead
due to lack of sunlight and can be pushed through, with a bit of effort.
Branches a few meters above the ground weave into complex patterns, soaking
up almost every single bit of light before it can reach the ground.  Vague
lighting makes it difficult to see the creatures that dart through the thorny
brush, and what can be seen is disconcerting.  Creatures here, as well as the
forest, are twisted and deformed, as if some great sorcerer put a curse on
the entire area, a curse that has festered and grown over the ages to create
a sinister darkness that hangs in the air.

&+LDeep in a Twisted Wood&N~
   Thorny, twisted trees weave together to create a dense and ominous forest.
Travel is difficult in any direction, but much of the thorny brush is dead
due to lack of sunlight and can be pushed through, with a bit of effort.
Branches a few meters above the ground weave into complex patterns, soaking
up almost every single bit of light before it can reach the ground.  Vague
lighting makes it difficult to see the creatures that dart through the thorny
brush, and what can be seen is disconcerting.  Creatures here, as well as the
forest, are twisted and deformed, as if some great sorcerer put a curse on
the entire area, a curse that has festered and grown over the ages to create
a sinister darkness that hangs in the air.

&+LBy a Dark Well in a Twisted Wood&N~
   Twisted trees and their intertwined branches expand right up to the side
of the dark stone well, covering the well, and everything else, in darkness.
Almost every drop of light is absorbed by the thick layer of interwoven
branches mere meters above the ground, cloaking everything in deep shadows
and darkness.  Faint lighting reveals the twisted shapes of the poor
creatures that dart through the forest.  It is clear that this area has
received its name from its creatures as well as its strange thorny trees.

   A sloping pathway to the east appears to lead out of the forest toward
some low foothills and mountains.  Impossible to see from beneath the
interwoven branches of the dense forest to the west, the mountains appear
quite suddenly, surprising travelers lucky enough to make it through the
forest.  The path is vague, undoubtedly rarely used, if at all, and appears
to be the safest way out of the dark and twisted forest that extends to the
west.  A small circle of stones rests beside a large boulder to the north,
showing that this area was once used as a campsite, though clearly not for a
very long time.

   The stories may be true!  The corner of a high wall can be seen to the
southeast.  Thick trees and their twisted branches make it impossible to see
the top of the wall but it is clearly there.  It appears to be made of
granite, but the twisted growth make it difficult to approach from here,
there may be a more clear view to the south or east.  There is still little
light here, the trees seem to pay the wall no mind as they grow right up
against it, straining to break their way through.  The twisted creatures that
make this odd forest their home have no fear of the wall either, it is clear
that whatever lies beyond has not been tended in many years.

&+LBeside a Mysterious Wall&N~
   Densely packed twisted trees make up this dark forest, their interwoven
branches preventing almost any light from reaching the ground.  Though dense
and thorny, the trees aren't even as tall as the odd granite wall that is to
the south.  The wall itself is slightly pitted and worn, yet is clearly very
well-made.  Junctures between the granite blocks used in its creation are
only visible under the most careful examination.  The builders of this wall
used great care and spared no expense in its construction.  Given the nature
of the forest that surrounds it, the careful construction of the wall is no
surprise.

&+LBeside a Mysterious Wall&N~
   Densely packed twisted trees make up this dark forest, their interwoven
branches preventing almost any light from reaching the ground.  Though dense
and thorny, the trees aren't even as tall as the odd granite wall that is to
the south.  The wall itself is slightly pitted and worn, yet is clearly very
well-made.  Junctures between the granite blocks used in its creation are
only visible under the most careful examination.  The builders of this wall
used great care and spared no expense in its construction.  Given the nature
of the forest that surrounds it, the careful construction of the wall is no
surprise.

&+LDeep in a Twisted Wood&N~
   A dark granite wall to the east adds slightly to the gloom.  Despite its
suggestion that rumors of hidden castles in this dark and twisted place may
be true, the wall has no openings, nor are the trees near it climbable.
Thickly interwoven a few meters above the ground block view of the top of the
wall, giving no suggestion as to its true size.  The twisted, thorny trees
have grown right up against the wall and clearly intend to someday breach it,
the wall has stood this long though, it is certainly good for many centuries
to come.  Strange creatures, twisted mates to this sinister forest, dart
through the brush keeping to the shadowy darkness that engulfs everything
here.

&+LBefore an Abandoned Gate&N~
   A gate leads through the wall to the east and out of the dark and twisted
wood that surrounds the sturdy walls it has been set into.  Branches a few
meters above the ground here have been woven into a thick canopy that blocks
out almost all light.  The vague lighting makes the gate look more like a
gaping maw, and through it there is a faint, ghostly breeze that speaks of
death and decay.  Though the gates beyond are well-built, it is their
sturdiness that remains, the builders and owners have long abandoned this
area.  Bards tell tales of great hidden treasures in places such as this,
and, though they may be true, is it really worth the risk?

&+LDeep in a Twisted Wood&N~
   The stories may be true!  The corner of a high wall can be seen to the
southeast.  Thick trees and their twisted branches make it impossible to see
the top of the wall but it is clearly there.  It appears to be made of
granite, but the twisted growth make it difficult to approach from here,
there may be a more clear view to the south or east.  There is still little
light here, the trees seem to pay the wall no mind as they grow right up
against it, straining to break their way through.  The twisted creatures that
make this odd forest their home have no fear of the wall either, it is clear
that whatever lies beyond has not been tended in many years.

&+LBeside a Mysterious Wall&N~
   Trees to the south have clearly been planted close together to create an
impassable thorny wall, whereas a granite wall to the north rises up above
the trees.  There is a stillness here, a silence that calls for caution while
negotiating this narrow east-west passageway between the wall and thick line
of trees.  Branches a few meters above the ground have woven themselves into
a thick ceiling that prevents almost any light from hitting the ground.  The
low ceiling of branches prevents any clear view of the top of the wall to the
south, it could end right above the branches or stretch on a few more meters.
There are few animals here, most of which dart away upon seeing anyone or
anything else in the forest.

   A still, stagnant quality to the air makes the twisted trees more ominous
and imposing.  The gray granite wall to the north rises up beyond the thickly
interlaced canopy formed by the branches mere meters above the ground
blocking any view of what may lie beyond it.  Though the bards' tales of lost
kindoms and castles may be true, the sturdy wall shows years of neglect and
wear hinting that whatever is beyond it is surely deserted.  It is possible
that some of the strange creatures in this twisted forest may have found
there way inside, if so, it would surely be a dangerous place to explore.
The weak and cowardly would never make it even this far into the forest, yet,
is any amount of strength and bravery enough to make it back out?

   Twisted trees grow so closely here that movement is almost impossible.  A
few ways are still open through the brush, some of which look almost well-
traveled, a frightening prospect in such a twisted place.  A stagnant
stillness hangs over the forest here, not even the smallest of twisted
creatures runs about.  Much of the forest has a dank, musty odor, the smell
of rot and decay, everything here is dry though, even the soil is as dry and
powdery as sand.  The quiet solitude screams one thing to any adventurer
brave enough to make it this far, it is time to go back, time to approach the
other challenges the vast world of Duris has to offer.  Getting out will be
as difficult as getting in and every creature here seems to sense fear and
spilled blood.

   Thorny, twisted trees weave together to create a dense and ominous forest.
Travel is difficult in any direction, but much of the thorny brush is dead
due to lack of sunlight and can be pushed through, with a bit of effort.
Branches a few meters above the ground weave into complex patterns, soaking
up almost every single bit of light before it can reach the ground.  Vague
lighting makes it difficult to see the creatures that dart through the thorny
brush, and what can be seen is disconcerting.  Creatures here, as well as the
forest, are twisted and deformed, as if some great sorcerer put a curse on
the entire area, a curse that has festered and grown over the ages to create
a sinister darkness that hangs in the air.

&+LA Large Camp&N~
   Though as dimly lit as the rest of the forest, this is clearly a large
campsite that has been carved out of the twisting trees.  Some of the trees
have clearly been removed, and all of the lower brush and branches have been
cleared away.  No fires can be seen as the camp extends to the south and west
but odd man-like creatures can be seen pacing around in the shadows.  Despite
the fact that the camp is clearly occupied, there is little sound.  The
creatures here must speak only rarely, if at all.

&+LA Large Camp&N~
   The thorny occupants of this quiet camp clearly have no love of visitors.
Then again, it is hard to imagine anyone wanting to befriend such hideous and
twisted creatures.  Though they have to clear homes or sleeping areas, there
are bushes and trees about that appear to have been specifically cultivated
for some reason.  Perhaps they bear fruit at some other time of the year, for
the moment though, they are barren and as thorny and forbidding as everything
else in the forest.  Who or what these creatures are is a mystery, one that
might be best left unanswered, the twisted man-like bundles of thorns clearly
have no desire to discuss anything with visitors.

&+LA Thorny Throne Room&N~
   A throne stands beneath the trees here, or what could pass for a throne.
Woven from long, sharp thorns it looks like more of a torture device than
something one would sit on.  The area around the throne has been cleared of
the mostly dead brush that can be seen in the rest of the forest, and even the
camp.  It would appear that the thorn-men that live here have a leader, or
chief.  He is most likely as friendly as the rest, and not likely to respond
well to an intrusion into his throne room.

   Creatures of some sort clearly live here, the nature of these creatures is
hard to determine however.  The thorny men that wander through the shadows may
be animals, or they may be strange animate plants of some sort, they look
cruel and unfriendly so it may be best to ignore the mystery of their nature
and depart.  Dried blood lines the ground to the south along the base of a
particularily thick bush and some deformed bones lie in the middle of the
camp, apparently discarded as rubbish.  Despite the bones and blood there is
no evidence that any camp or cooking fires have ever burned here, any meat
that has been eaten here must have been eaten raw.

is old, close inspection reveals that it must extend deep into the ground and
that only a fraction of it is visible.  Thorn men guard it closely, clearly
upset that any others have discovered it.  The campsite continues to the
