The table and chairs in this room are very simple and cheap looking.
They don't look like furniture someone would enjoy a meal on, but
more like a table to hold things or for some other purpose.

&+gShrine of the Kuo-Toa~
   This small island of land in-between the two pools of water rises about
three feet above the waterline.  A large altar has been constructed at its
center, covered by a thin stone canopy atop four pillars.  The altar itself
is blood stained and decorated with numerous images of grotesque monsters
or deities.  Covering every square inch of ground on this tiny island is a
huge image of the Kuo-Toan god.  There is a smaller hut to the west,
and large ponds to the north and south.

   The large building rises up only thirty feet or so, but compared to
the other buildings in the complex it is quite sizable.  There are half

small mithril pedestal.  There is a six foot round circular portal on the
west wall that glows brightly in a green hue.  This is obviously where the
leader of these people usually resides, making battle or trading plans for
the duergar people.  The only exit from this chamber is to the north into a

&+mCircular Room~
   This room is about fifteen feet in diameter with a flat floor and ceiling.
The craftsmanship of the mining here is very exquisite, with walls carved
smoother than any miner on the surface world could dream of.  The reason
for the awesome craftsmanship of this area becomes apparent from the
large image carved on the north wall.  There is a shaft in the exact center of
the room leading downwards, and a carved tunnel heading to the west.  no
other exits from this chamber are visible.

image carving~
The image carved into the wall is of a huge eight legged spider, with a
humans head and large razor sharp mandibles.  The face of the spider
looks vaguely female, wearing a twisted and evil expression.  A single line
of text accompanies the spider at the base of the image, written in a very
ornate language that is definitely NOT common.  The writing is more akin
to elven in some respects.  Taken as a whole, the image speaks loudly
that whoever carved these caves either worked for, or were members of,
the Drow elven race...

on the ends, not sharp.  There eerie affect at having millions of tons of

&+WTunnel of Intense Light~
   This narrow tunnel radiates an incredibly bright green light from
every direction.  The intensity is of the light is such that no mortal
human could stand to look upon it without shielding their eyes.
A shadowy vapor fills the area, blurring vision and making it very
difficult to see anything.  The air in here is thick and intensely hot,
with small blue bolts of magical energy sparking from wall to wall
every few seconds.  Because of the brightness, what lies at the end
of the tunnel cannot be seen.  This is the kind of place that children
have nightmares about, a place that would strike terror into the
hearts of all but those with godlike gallantry and a will of steel.

&+mOn an Underground River~
   The river is shallow here, only about eight feet deep making the
current in this cavern much more turbulent.  Water sprays upwards
in several different places as it crashes against stalagmites on its
southerly march.  The cavern here is only ten or fifteen feet high,
with large stalactites protruding down into the water's current.

and continues on its easterly march.  The river's current is made more

that slowly flows to the west against the river's current.  The steam seems
to be emanating from a large open area to the east of here.  The river itself
flows westward into the much larger area, though it is too foggy to see what
is there.  Thousands of small stalactites have formed on the ceiling from
condensation, as the steam collects and falls back into the river.

&+mBoiling Lake in an Underground Cavern~
   The river flows into a large cavern that is perhaps two hundred feet in
diameter and fifty feet tall.  Steam rises off of the waters surface, and the
lake appears to be boiling near its center, probably from some sort of volcanic
activity far below.  The air is extremely hot and uncomfortable here, and
vision is almost totally impaired from the waves of steam that slowly
roll into the cavern leading out to the west.  There are no other visible
exits from this cavern.

and appears to be somewhat stagnant.  Water slowly drips into the pool
from a thin crack along the ceiling of the cave, from which a cool draft
blows. To the north the pool widens as it disappears into a long slit in the
rock face. A loud rushing sound can be heard coming from the north. Tunnels

&+mA Mushroom-Filled Tunnel&n~
   This rocky tunnel is covered in mushrooms
of all sizes.  Some of them even give off a faint
glow which lites up the cavern just enough to
see the different colors and sizes of the
mushrooms.  This tunnel seems to on for quite
a ways, but sound is heard in the distance.

&+mCave Tunnel~
   This rough cave tunnel has an unpleasant smell to it, similar to that of
human body odor.  The tunnel continues to the west another thirty feet or
so, where it connects to another cave.  There is none of the glowing
fungus in this eight foot wide corridor.

&+LA Dark Tunnel Smelling of &+gDe&+Gc&+gay&n~
&+L   This narrow passage seems to lead directly to an
&+Lancient burial chamber. Even though this place has
&+Lnot been in use for hundreds of years, a dark magic
&+Lkeeps it alive. The tennants who were laid to rest
&+Lhere have since woken up and wandering restlessly
&+Laround their tombs.&n
