&+LA N&+ce&+Cx&+cu&+Ls~
&+L   Polished marble forms the slick walls around you in a perfect cube.
&+LGlowing&+c po&+Crta&+cls&+L hum quietly from each of the dark walls. Through
&+Ltheir swirling mass of colors, you can vaugely make out other rooms
&+Lof the stronghold.  To the north appears to be an enormous staircase,
&+Lwhile a glowing altar looms through the eastern portal.  The vault
&+Lentrance hums on the western wall, and the exit is back to your south.

&+waccess to the lower levels of the keep.  Magically shaped from the
&+wearth itself of granite and quartz, it flows naturally down the long
&+wcorridor.  Echos reverberate off of the high ceiling and the hard
&+wwalls, carrying the sound of footsteps to the bottom of the steps.
