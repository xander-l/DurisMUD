&+gThick Bushes Off the Path&N~
   There is a east-west path through the thick bushes that line the path.
This would make the ideal spot for an ambush, with the &+ydry brush&N providing
plenty of hiding places for the highwayman.  An opening to the west is narrow
and concealed, a well-traveled path leads east.

&+gWide Path through Scrub&N~
   The path through the &+gthorny bushes&N is wide and well-traveled. Prints in
the &+ydried mud&N tell of horses, men and something humanoid, but larger than
human known to inhabit these parts. The path descends into a canyon to the
east and narrows into a thick group of bushes to the west.

more passable, with "bridges" leading east and west. Clumps of &+ggrass&N and &+Gbushes&N

extra branches and shrubs have been cut somewhere else and brought here.
These branches and shrubs are in various shades of green to yellow as they
wither.  It is a poor camouflage, but it provides plenty of cover for an
ambush. Openings in the brush lead east and west. An odor of smoke and
some foul stench combine here.

their way up or down the cliff beside the waterfall.  What toe and hand holds
existing are covered with slimy algae and lichen, making the climb quite
precarious indeed.  Luckily a few small pine shrubs have eked out an existence
here in the cracks, providing a few relatively dry and secure supports.

&+yPrecarious Cliff&N~
   This cliff provides barely enough handholds for the bravest of climbers.
Even these small ledges and cracks are made more dangerous by the slimy algae
and lichen which coat the limestone cliff face. Luckily a few small shrubs
grow in the cracks of the wall to give extra support.  The waterfall roars
along parallel the cliff.  Both reach an end about twenty feet below.

&+yBase of Cliff&N Near a &+BWater&+Wfall&N~
   This area is a small flat area near the base of a crashing waterfall. The
roar is deafening and the entire area is obscured by a fine mist. Ferns and
mosses grow amongst the rocks, combining in this idyllic area.  The water is
about ten feet below, down a steep, smooth incline. The cliff looks barely
climbable and a path, covered with large vaguely humanoid footprints, leads
north down to the water.

&+BIdyllic Bank of Stream&N~
   This eastern bank of this stream is covered in ferns, moss, and few small
willow trees.  The canyon walls make the area shady and a beautiful if a bit
terrifying waterfall can be seen to the south.  Some mist drifts north from
the waterfall over the now languid waters of the stream and diffuses amongst
the bushes and trees.  The stream appears to join a sizable river north.

&+LLanguid &+BStream&N~
   North of the waterfall the turbulent waters have broadened and calmed,
and the surface of the water is calm and a bit sluggish.  The limestone walls
of the canyon still rise high here and lichens abound, thriving on the mist
that the waterfall gives off.  This same mist obscures the area south of here,
making it difficult to make out detail. All that is certain is the deafening
roar which the water produces

   The water here is a turbulent confusion of eddies and undertows, made more
dangerous still by the limited visibility due to the mist. The stream to the
north is calmer.  The entrance to a cave can barely be seen through the mist
to the west.

&+BHalf-Submerged&N &+LCave Mouth&N~
   This tubular cave is about twelve feet in diameter. A couple of feet of
water fill the bottom of the cave. Limestone walls are covered with moss
and unidentifiable slime.  A few shiny rocks have been wedged into the cracks
by some entity, and a bizarre cairn of small skulls lies in the shallow
water at the western section of this part of the cave.  Beyond the cairn
the tunnel continues west, while the bottom of the roaring waterfall is
east.

&+gAlligator &+LCave&N~
   This limestone cave is filled with whole fish, rotting fish, half-eaten

appear to have been chewed on by something very large, with twenty pound
trout apparently eaten in two bites.  The area has been decorated with the
fish carcasses.  The skeletons has been plastered to the walls with an unknown
paste, and the floor is covered with a mosaic-like design of dead fish.

   Halfway down a waterfall, the water rushes by.  Above, the lip of the fall
can be seen, while below the water crashes to a misty, turbulent end. The
water sparkles as it falls, catching the light and looking much like a sheet
of diamonds. A cave mouth can be dimly seen farther down on the western wall
of the canyon.

The walls of the canyon are lined with bales of cloth, sacks, barrels,
ingots of raw iron and bronze, and chests. Despite the crowding, this
area of the canyon is in pristine condition, the ground clean and the
vegetation healthy.  Tall &+Glimestone&N walls rise to all sides except the

weaves its way through a narrow part of the canyon that slopes down steeply.
