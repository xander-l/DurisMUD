&+WWithin &+wWhi&+Wte&+wwa&+Wshe&+wd &+cOv&+Cal C&+cha&+Cmb&+cer~
   A magical twilight fills the chamber wall to wall. The walls look to have
runes of some sort etched into them and do not seem harmful. There are no
distinguishing features in this room besides the magical twilight and this
twilight is not natural and there is no source of it. Magic undoubtably
fills the chamber and can only be seen with the trained eye. Potent magic such
as this is hardly ever seen in the outside world and even in the mystical lands
of the elves it is unnatural and would be celebrated, but here it seems as
natural as air. A strange ripple runs through the air and the aura of peace
is only disturbed by that. Continuence, the sought after survival of the
soul is what humankind strives to understand but it takes a lifetime just to
understand that's what we've been looking for every minute of our life.
Understanding and having the wisdom to acknowledge everything in its entirety
is true knowledge and is the only way to salvation that some would do anything
to be master of, even practice the darker arts to preserve the body while
the soul decays.

A &+LTwi&+ysted &+LFor&+gest Pat&+Lh~
   Although some would panic if they were lost in a forest, no one has ever
done that here. The forest seems centuries old and most of the trees have grown
over fifty feet and their bases look wider than most ogres' waist lines. There
are no game trails nor any other trails for that matter. The trees sway gently
in the wind as if gently jamming to some imaginary music. There are no animals
in this forest, or perhaps they are deeper within the forest. There is very
little sunlight and it is almost as if it is magically tucked away. The smell
of the trees seem odd as well, they smell afraid and look old and twisted. A
small mist obscures the ground and little critters ascend the trees. Darkness
envelopes everything on this small forest path, which isn't very large.

&+GA &+gPlush&+G Green Courtyard~
   This courtyard must have an army of caretakers tending to it everyday. The
amount of grass and flowers growing is outstanding and nothing else can be
found like it in the world. Two fountains channel water into the air, giving
access to all who may desire the precious life giving substance. The garden is
a combination of lush lawn shrubs and trees of all shapes and sizes. This is
certainly a place where someone could always find a nice quiet place to just
sit and ponder life. The great garden is surrounded on every side by either a
huge stone wall or a castle structure. To the north a large tower looms, to the
east a gigantic library stands, and the caretakers' gardens are to the west.
The only interesting building of the three would be the tower, for it seems to
be enshrouded in darkness. One has a difficult time staring straight at it, and
if they're not looking for it, it might be overlooked quite easily. The height
of this tower is unparallel, rising nearly a hundred feet into the air. It
was built using a cold black stone and has but one window. The small irongate
surrounding the tower is adequate protection against small animals and rodents,
but it could not keep anyone over the age of five out, interesting, perhaps
there are greater lengths the creators of the tower created to prevent anyone
from intruding, things unseen yet.

A &+WSn&+cow Co&+Wve&+Cred Tr&+Wail~
   The trail winds through several buffalo-hide tents, each one spouting
dark smoke into the air from small openings at their top. Like most of
Mugnork, this sector of the settlement is covered in a thick layer of crisp
snow, several feet deep in many sections. Totems depicting the bird-like
spirits of wind and shaman magic dot the area between the tents, some of them
towering over twenty feet into the air. Black feathers, attached to thick
leather cords, hang from many of the tents and totems, used to ward off the
evil spirits that shamans and witchdoctors have to deal with. The barbarians
of this town do not welcome visitors and it wouldn't be surprising if they
attacked upon site. The smell of freshly cooked meat fills the air.

Before the &+WMass&+Live Whi&+Wte Was&+Lhed Ga&+Wtes~
&+W   A huge pair of gates loom to the north and their white washed walls can be
&+Wspotted for miles around. These gates rise well over fifty feet and the
&+Wadjoining walls are nearly as tall. What they aim to keep out must be
&+Wgargantuan, or maybe they're trying to keep something in. There are no
&+Wparapets and the designers must have felt secure for not constructing them,
&+Was if nothing could ever be threatening. Many different runes cover the gates,
&+Wbut they're undecipherable. The runes on the right most gate are of a different
&+Wdesign etched so close to each other, forming a circle. In the center of the
&+Wcircle there is a rune print, standing alone, waiting. Perhaps this is a clue
&+Whow to open these gates. The walls stretch a good quarter mile in either
&+Wdirection and oddly enough the forest plant life doesn't grow anywhere near
&+Wthem. This &+ycitadel&n &+Wis rather small, perhaps a few towers, but nothing
&+Wmore.

The &+yOut&+Yer Edg&+yes&n of the &+rMoun&+Ltain &+gFor&+Gest~
   A large white washed gate is to the north and at all hours this gate is
closed because the forest is not a pleasant place. The gate and wall protect
the citadel and rise well over fifty feet and are made of a combination of
stone and granite and a large tower is visible above the walls, it is
perhaps a hundred feet tall and its stone walls can be seen for miles around.
The citadel spans a great distance eastward and westard but there doesn't seem
to be much of a populous living behind the walls. There is something dark and
mysterious about this citadel, and perhaps the dark tower looming over the
great white washed walls might answer a few questions. There must be some
sort curse upon this tower, or perhaps this is just dark magic at work.

&+Wopposite of the wall rise well over twenty feet, some even higher. Over
&+Wtheir roof tops, however, larger buildings are visible, much more magnificent
&+Wbuildings that seem to be in the center of the citadel. The cobblestones

&+Wthemselves look to have been molded from the earth itself. A plush garden
&+Wcourtyard is to the north and beyond that courtyard a dark tower sits in a
&+Wshroud of darkness. It's almost as if this tower doesn't want to be seen,
&+Wjust gazing at it hurts one's eyes. An enchantment of some type must have been
&+Wlaid upon the tower to protect it and the tower is more than just magical,
&+Wrising well over a hundred feet into the air, crafted from cold black stone,
&+Wit's big.

The &+WGre&+Lat Per&+Wil &+rMoun&+Ltain~
   Large mountain peaks rise several thousand feet into the air just to the
west as the cliffs of the mountain look treacherous because they're jagged and
look like they're ready to tumble down with the slightest breeze. It's impossible
to fly over the mountain for fear of the wind because it could knock a person
off their trajectory and cause a person to collide into the mountain itself. A
small cave entrance is visible to the west despite some overgrown vines and
vegetated growth nearly obscuring it. The clouds create a donut shape loop
around the very tip of the mountain, a very peculiar sight. The forest to the
east thickens and runs far off into the horizon. Running water can be heard,
if one listens long hard enough, originating from the cave. There must be an
underground stream or river within it.

An &+rE&+bl&+ye&+Cme&+yn&+bt&+ral &+bT&+yu&+Cnn&+ye&+bl~
   This tunnel is one of the strangest places one could ever encounter. The
walls are covered in a mixture of &+Cice&n, &+rfire&n,&+b water&n and &+yearth&n that all appears
to be alive. The &+Cice&n crackles and forms what looks like faces within
itself. The fire sits an inch off the surface of the walls and forms strange,
unnatural symbols and shapes. Swirling under and around the &+rfire&n is a thin
layer of rapidly moving &+bwater&n that swirls and swoshes as it covers the walls.
Finally, clumps of brown &+yearth&n form nasty looking faces upon the wall
and then flatten and dissipate as quickly as they formed. A most mysterious,
yet somewhat disturbing place. If it weren't for the freezing temperature here,
one might be able to think freely, however, since not even the most cold
blooded reptiles could live here due to the chill. Lord knows this is the
dwelling of supernatural where normal rules apply not.

A &+cSilv&+Cer Sp&+cring&n before a &+yMoun&+Ltain C&+yave~
   A huge mountain rises several thousand feet into the air. The very tip of
of the mountain has a mushroom shaped cloud centered around it and wind brushes
against the side of it causing jagged rocks to tumble down the side. A few
trees grow on the lower half of the mountain, where the atmosphere can support
plant life easily. A large cave opening is barely visible to the north, where
slimy vegetated growth nearly hide it. If this cave runs the entire length of
the mountain then it might be possible to actually traverse to the other side,
since scaling or flying over the mountain is out of the question. There are
rumors floating around in the outside world about this mountain, that it is
cursed and that long ago a great war was once fought here. This mountain was a
battleground between &+Wgood&n and &+Levil&n, with neither side winning the war and it is
cursed and those who enter this undermountain are doomed to die.

Before a &+LBla&+yck Ga&+Lte~
   This tower must have been created by the great magi of the dark for one
reason, protection. The guardians that reside in this tower are summoned and
imbued with great strength with but one task, to destroy any intruder. The
tower looks as if it were molded from the surrounding earth. A strong sorcerer
is at work in this tower. The wards here are sure to do his bidding and a dark
wizard inside means to be alone while he practices his dark art. A magical
mist fills the area and the mist accompanies the giants that stand protecting
the entrance to the tower, powerful beasts not only physically but magically.
They could crush an entire city with a few devastating blow or send it to
oblivion with one swift thought, distorting reality. These giants destroy
anything and everything that do not possess a certain charm granted to them by
their master. It is rumored that many adventurers have tried to seek out this
tower in hope of acquiring the many secrets therein, however, all those who
have tried must have died and never been heard from again. These fallen heroes
were not of the ruffian type and most were seasoned heroes and veterans of
many wars. Light emanates from the upper level of the tower, through its sole
window, which must be the master's chambers.

   The tunnel ceiling rises over twenty feet and there are humongous
stalactites above that drip water down to the cavern below. This has continued
over the centuries to form tiny little stalagmites on the cavern's floor. These
cones are very pointy and could impale someone. The larger stalactites above
could crush anything underneath them if they were to fall. There are many
pebbles and small puddles in this tunnel. One slip, one tumble is all it would
take to send someone to their death. There is rumored to be fearsome beasts
within this undermountain, giants that were summoned by some powerful warden to
protect its master. Demons are said to serve this master also, who has lived
for centuries. The only way someone could live that long is if he practices
the dark art of necromacy, which leads to sacrificing the body and spirit
for an eternity on this realm.

In the &+gFo&+Lre&+gst &nof &+gD&+re&+ga&+rt&+gh~
&+L   This brooding forest seems to come alive when someone enters it. The
&+Lhollowed out trees that have been dead for several years, yet rise over
&+Ltwenty feet in height, seem to sing a carination of death to those within
&+Learshot. Weeds sprout up above the slime and moss covered ground. They're
&+La complete hindrance to most travelers, but not to night creatures who live
&+Lwith the darkness. Many species of reptiles are heard in the distance,
&+Lsplashing within the forest waters. The vines above, on the dead wood, drip
&+Ltheir slimy water. The cold is a finality, something everyone has to bear.
&+LThe trees above block out the night sky, creating pitch black. The mud makes
&+Lit very difficult to proceed, impeding progress. The nature of this forest is
&+Levil, it is rumored that there are none other like it in the world, that it
&+Lis cursed and those who enter it are doomed to die.

   There are no chairs or tables in this study. There are, however, books. Rows
and rows of books lined up into columns in the northern corner of the chamber.
The books seem to never end, an infinite number of books to select from to
read is a greater treasure than a pile of gold that could stretch across the
world ten feet high ten times over. Choosing a book is not as difficult as it
might seem. All one has to do is summon the name of the book into one's head
and it'll appear as if beckoned. Studying is an arduous task, that is why it
takes a silent place to do it in. Noise is not permitted within these chambers
for just that reason. Studying is even harder without chairs and tables to do
it with, however, the magi are magi after all. One doesn't' need a chair when
they can hover in mid-air, and one doesn't need a table when the books float.
The wealth of the magi is unparallel, any student of the art would give
anything just to have the chance to study here.

   A tunnel ceiling rises well over twenty feet. The stalactites above drip
steadily the water that they've collected over the millenia. Throughout the
years those large cones above have dripped water only for the water to
crystalize to form the stalagmites on the tunnel floor, although they're much
smaller than their counterparts. The moisture on the ground along with loose
pebbles makes traversing these tunnels very treacherous. A soft roaring in
the distance sounds like a stream or a waterfall, or perhaps both. Streams
are known to exist underneath mountains, they're a great source of fresh water.
An odd scent fills the tunnel, the smell of life and death. The life smell
resembles plant life and must be the direct result of the underwater stream.
The death smell is similar to rotting carcasses.

   There are flashes of silver studs spread out across this small cavern tunnel
mine where the barbarians dig for silver in. They're cultivating silver
because it's an abundant trade resource for supplies and another great source of
leverage for quicker trade negotiations. These tunnels are littered with lotsa
debris and refuse because of all the mining efforts and constant pressures of
people's demand on the miners. Barbarians aren't renown for their efforts for
their mining or their search for illustrious riches to make them rich but their
comes a time in all of society where they must focus on more than just survival
and focus their energies into other pursuits besides war, conflict, deceit, and
treachery and these barbarians are banding together to do just that.

&+G   A flower scent fills the air. Many different types of flowers blossom in
&+Gthis beautiful garden. Every rose imaginable grows here, with every type of
&+Gthorn bush to go with it. The flowers are planted in the center of the
&+Ggarden, around some green grass. A bench rests upon the grass with a fountain
&+Gjust behind it. A well thought out place of relaxation. Whomever built this
&+Gplace had only that upon their mind. Sounds seem to avoid this place for some
&+Greason, perhaps this place is a place of meditation, and any sort of sounds
&+Gcould possibly disturb that meditation. Although all gardens possess a serene
&+Gaura around them, this one has more than just that. It's almost as if an
&+Genchantment has been laid upon this place to ensure that anyone who so wishes
&+Gcan let lose of the stress of the outside world and relax.

A &+yCob&+Lble&+ysto&+Lne &+yTra&+Lil &nleading to a &+LBla&+yck Ga&+Lte&n~
   The paved cobblestones that make up the road provide adequate means of
travel for anyone who would want to traverse them. The architects of this city
had the sagacity to allow for further construction and expansion. A large
magical tower looms to the north. It's easily discernable that its magical,
simply because of a shroud of darkness covering it, making it unseen to those
who aren't looking for it, a powerful technique employed by most magi to
protect themselves from intruders who would wish to do them bodily harm.
The stone tower must protect such powerful secrets the likes of which the
world has never seen. If only one could traverse it safely and avoid the
guardians of the tower, wherever they may dwell. The guardian wards must
be powerful, summoned from other dimensions, perhaps the elemental planes.

Before the &+LHa&+rn&+Lg&+rin&+gg&+L Ga&+rr&+Ld&+ren&+gs&n of &+LD&+ra&+Lrk&+rn&+Le&+rs&+Ls~
   This is the most fearful site one can see when arriving at the fringes of
a thick forest. There are an innumerable amount of heads mounted on pikes here.
It is the most frightening vision. Crows pick at the remains of heads once
belonging to human, elven, and minotaur soldiers. Their faces, unreadable,
most likely died in terror. The feeling is clear, this is a message to everyone,
stay away. Whomever is evil and foul enough to do this would surely want to
be alone. The twisted mind capable of doing this would surely do something,
anything he wanted just to give in to his compulsion, a compulsion of
spreading repugnation and fear. The fear of something is the lack of love of
something. By spreading more fear, you spread more distrust than love. These
heads on pikes are clearly meant to demoralize an enemy. Just the smell
alone is enough to send men to their knees. The forest looming to the east
looks lonely and thick. The breeze picks up, stirs the air, bring together
the mixed scent of fresh air and death.

&+GA Mysterious Chamber~
&+g   It is here that visitors are accosted and treated as guests. For there
&+gis no doubt that those who enter this tower are watched with more than just
&+geyes. Justification of this sort of treatment is simple, if they don't touch
&+git or see it, then they won't even begin to think about fooling with it, and
&+gend up blowing up the entire tower. However, despite being trapped in this
&+groom until it is befitting the magi to entertain them, the room has many a
&+gdecorative and intricate items to gaze upon, none of which having the least
&+gmagical power. A fire in the far corner of the room blazes steadily, fueled by
&+gsomething that it could never possibly consume, the power of magic. The tower
&+gdoesn't receive many guests, actually it has only received one, and that
&+gvisitor rests as a doormat outside. However, that was over a century ago, and
&+git was recognized since then that the magi that dwell here want nothing to do
&+gwith the outside world. Just what ungodly secrets they are unearthing is left
&+gto the imagination, since no conclave would venture to find out, since that
&+gwould mean actually coming within close proximity to the tower.

Under &+cHo&+Ct Wa&+cter&+C Spr&+cing~
   The stream flows smoothly as it runs through the mountain's heart. This
mountain must have been an active volcano somewhere in its distant past,
because that is the sole reason this underground river is so warm. There are
no fish in this fresh water even though it is drinkable by all, and it holds
a large number of photocongria. The water is crystal clear and it is possible
to see further plant growth downwards a little. Although it is nearly pitch
black and impossible to see passed the thick plant growth, an underwater cave
is visible. This cave has an entrance, so there must be an exit somewhere.
Maybe the exit is deeper within the mountain still. A small current tugs softly
to the south, the river must be flowing toward the outside world. Where there
is a river, there must be a waterfall, which is where this river would end.
Short swims should not be a problem.

In a&+L De&+bep&+L Under&+bwater&+L Cave~
   The water is hot, almost scalding. The water seems to be sucking everything
into the cave and the current is very strong. Plants and photocongria all
succumb to the force of the current. Plants are pivoting back and forth as the
current tries to rip up its roots. The rocks on either side of the cave slide
too, towards the north further deeper into the cave. The slime and fungus on
the cavern walls all point in an eerie manner toward the center of the cave,
which has to be north. Whatever is sucking everything to it must be an anomally
of some sort, perhaps created long ago when the mountain was born. The vines to
the south outside the cave don't seem affected at all by the vacuum suction,
perhaps this vacuum is magical after all. A doom awaits to everyone who
ventures within these depths.

&+gA Majestic Corridor~
&+G   The tower wall encloses the corridor, allowing only one path of travel
&+Gwith a limited amount of space. Wondrous light streaks out from the
&+Gwalls, its source are crystals and diamonds reflecting all colors of the
&+Gspectrum, making an impressive scenario. Robbers would have a field day with
&+Gthis area, if not for runes of warding that are humming in fury to discourage
&+Gany attempt to deprive the wall of their precious jewels. These precious
&+Gjewels cover both walls entirely, but not the ceiling nor the floor. The
&+Gcorridor is a little over ten feet wide and the height stretches upward to
&+Gabout fifteen feet, however, a humming sound is plainly audible to the
&+Gimmediate area. The magicians in this tower must have imbued the crystals
&+Gwith some sort of power, or perhaps these crystals are the source of these
&+Ggreat magi's strength. Whatever the case, these crystals cannot be taken and
&+Gthey possess great magic.

At the Bottom of a&+R Fierce &+rM&+LA&+be&+gL&+Ls&+bT&+rr&+gO&+cM~
&+r   The force of the swirling water is nearly impossible to fight. Dead fish,
&+bplants, decayed corpses, and large rocks swirl around and around in a
&+gspiral creating a sort of a funnel underwater. Everything that entered the cave
&+ywas sucked into this maelstrom and beaten to a bloody pulp by heavy rocks and
&+Lother debris and eventually drowned. This maelstrom must be magical in nature,
&+yconjured by some powerful beast or magician. An ancient beast known as the
&+gKraken is said to live under such conditions, in a world shrouded in mystery.
&+rNot much is known about this mythological beast except that it feeds only on
&+bsacrifices made for its appeasement, else it would wreak havoc on all
&+Lliving things. It's rumored to have green scaly skin that is stronger than the
&+ystrongest of steels and harder than the hardest rock. Such scales could
&+bdeflect any physical attack attempted. Despite its physical prowess, its real
&+cpower lies in its ability to warp reality. Mind over matter is an incredible
&+gmagic to behold and the kraken does so freely and without mercy.

A &+cHo&+Ct Wa&+cter &+CSpr&+cing~
   This is the kind of the place that insects are born, hatched from their
eggs to face the rest of the world. Insects need a warm, moist environment in
order to lay eggs since eggs won't survive in cold dry places. This hot water
spring provides both of the forementioned criteria. This hot water spring
doesn't only serve as a breeding ground, it's also a source of drinking water
the animals in the forest just outside the cave nourish from. The spring must
run underground through this mountain and empty out in the forest. The water
isn't scorching to the touch, but it is hot never the less. Steam rises from
the spring. Water drips from the cavern's ceiling above, where stalactites
hang. These large cones, stalactites, could easily crush any living creature
underneath, even an ogre or a giant, for they must weigh more than ten tons.

   Although some would panic if they were lost in a forest, no one has ever
done that here. The forest seems centuries old and most of the trees have grown
over fifty feet and their bases look wider than most ogres' waist lines. There
are no game trails nor any other trails for that matter. The trees sway gently
in the wind as if gently jamming to some imaginary music. There are no animals
in this forest, or perhaps they are deeper within the forest. There is very
little sunlight and it is almost as if it is magically tucked away. The smell
of the trees seem odd as well, they smell afraid and look old and twisted. A
small mist obscures the ground and little critters ascend the trees. Darkness
envelopes everything on this small forest path, which isn't very large.

   Large gnarled tree roots rise from the ground from century old oaks that
are hundreds of feet high. The leaves of these trees gnarled, dark, and there
seems to be a bloody red sap profusing all over the trees bark, and the
discoloration of the veins is apparent a long the lower limbs. All the trees
have thick and sappy trunks that seem to bleed red, but an ominous mist fills
the forest floor, obscuring most of everything. Strange forest critters run
along trees and larger scaly ones with long red tails hang from the branches.
This forest is surrounded by a magical darkness it seems, and even during the
day light never reaches this place. The vileness that infests this forest can
not survive sunlight, and the creatures within can not exist without darkness.

&+gLa&+Li&+Lr of t&+ghe Krak&+Len~
   Piles of skeletons fill the lair of the Kraken. Scales litter the floor
in various different places, green scales. This chamber rises well over a
hundred feet and the Kraken must truly be gigantic. The cave stretches off
in indistinguishable amount of feet to the north and seems to go on forever.
A certain section of the lair is flat, and the number of scales covering this
part is uncountable. This must be where the beast hibernates until called by
the gods to devour a sacrifice. The gods are a frivolous bunch of beings and
in times of weakness they demand that a mortal be sacrificed to appease the
Kraken. During its long slumbers, the world changes ten fold and only one
thing remains the same for this massive beast, food. As long as the stars
burn bright in the night sky, this monster will have mortals to feast upon
and immortals to thank for it. For we all know immortals are despotic, even
in their own ranks they distrust each other.

   The cliff is covered in clouds, the type of clouds that one usually sees
from the base of a mountain such as this. These clouds form a sort of donut
shape around the top of the mountain, a very strange thing. There are a few
bird nests tucked underneath many rocks and foliage, some with little baby
birds within. It wouldn't be wise to upset these nests, for when the mother and
father return it could cause them to go berserk. Such attacks from wild birds
is not too uncommon, the larger more ferocious type such as the roc or carrion
aren't afraid of any humanoid and will defend themselves and their kin. Not
many adventurers travel to the top of many mountains, especially this one,
for it is rumored that a large barbarian encampment resides someplace near the
top and that they do not welcome visitors. It is said that those who have
ventured to the very top of the mountain have never been seen alive again.

Prints from a wide assortment of sources, mainly barbarians, have packed down
the snow, keeping the trail from becoming covered by the heavy snowfalls that
plague this area. Small tents can be seen in the distance, in almost every
direction, each of those tents housing a family of barbarians. Large mounds
of snow flank this trail on both sides, pushed there by the barbarian guards
to give the encampment an easy traveling road. The air is fresh and clean,
very unlike most of the heavily populated cities found in the realm, simply
because the barbarians are rigorous and study, unafraid of working to achieve
that they want and simply because they have the ability to survive on their
own without help from any other culture. The air is cool and breezy high in
these mountains.

small black stones. The heat from the dancing flames are used to prepare food
and provide light, as well as heat the tent. A few small bundles are piled in
one area of the tent, storing food and extra clothing for the barbarian family
that lives here.

   The raging WhiteFox river rushes wildly below this sturdy wooden bridge,
carrying large chunks of snow and ice with it. This twenty foot long bridge is
the only one of its kind, spanning the frigid river below, making the
barbarian encampment family secure from most land assaults. The bridge appears
to be fairly new, erected only ten years ago by the united barbarian tribes
as they gather together to form this encampment. Always wary of danger, the
barbarians never leave this bridge unguarded, because they realize the threat
the giants of this land present, and are ever cautious. It is written that if
those sentries who are posted here ever waver, that they are given twenty
lashes over the back and forced out of their home, banished for life.

   Mugnork, the greatest barbarian encampment ever formed, stretches far to
the east, west, and north. Paths of packed snow wind through the encampment
leading between the numerous buffalo-hide tents that dot the area. A totem,
crafted from an ancient pine tree, stands firmly planted in the snow here. The
animal and spiritual symbols for the many barbarian tribes that populate this
village have been carved into the totem, their sharp features displaying the
time and talent it took to create them. A forest of pine trees can be seen far
off to the north, and the bridge which leads across the White Fox river is
guarded fiercely by barbarians to the south. Barbarians don't like outsiders
within their encampment, especially outsiders of a different race. It makes
them feel off guard in a place they're supposed to feel at home, which might
justify their eagerness to rid any intruder.

A &+WSn&+gow Co&+Wve&+gred&n &+gPa&+Wth&n through &+BMugnork~
   The snowy trail that leads through Mugnork seems to be well-traveled.
Prints from a wide assortment of sources, mainly barbarians, have packed down
the snow, keeping the trail from becoming covered by the heavy snowfalls that
plague this area. Small tents can be seen in the distance, in almost every
direction, each of those tents housing a family of barbarians. Large mounds
of snow flank this trail on both sides, pushed there by the barbarian guards
to give the encampment an easy traveling road. The air is fresh and clean,
very unlike most of the heavily populated cities found in the realm, simply
because the barbarians are rigorous and study, unafraid of working to achieve
that they want and simply because they have the ability to survive on their
own without help from any other culture. The air is cool and breezy high in
these mountains.

&+r   The inside of this tent is filled with choking smoke, which slowly leaves
&+rthe tent through a small hole in its ceiling. The source of the billowing
&+rclouds of smoke seems to be a large iron forge set up on the eastern side of
&+rthe tent. Used to repair damaged equipment, as well as forge new creations,
&+rthe weapon shop is always busy with visiting adventurers or local barbarian
&+rwarriors. The heat reaches nearly unbearable levels during the busiest times
&+rof the day when the forge is constantly in use. Counters and tables fill up
&+rmost of the remaining space, each packed with weapons for sale or trade. The
&+rtribe sticks together when it comes to making money and everyone of them lends
&+ra hand in the hunting, crafting, and selling of manufactured goods. Together
&+ras a community they survive.

&+Wimpressive log cabin, which was one of the first structures to be built by
&+Wthe barbarians when they founded Mugnork so many years ago. Constructed and
&+Wowned by Fithis, one of the most famous hunters within the settlement, this
&+Wcozy Inn was named after the Great Stag, a barbarian spirit associated with
&+Whonor and bravery. Small wooden doors lead off of this chamber in many
&+Wdirections, each one heading towards a comfortable single room used by many
&+Wadventurers that use Mugnork as a safe haven for the rest in the northern
&+Wtundra. A large room can be seen off tot he west, containing a blazing fire
&+Wand numerous wooden tables.

&+Wdrifts of snow. The white mound has been blown against the structure, reaching
&+Whalfway to its roof. A brick chimney billows out dark columns of smoke, which
&+Wis quickly caught in the frigid artic air and carried away. the cabin contains
&+Wthe Great Stag Inn, one of the few gathering places within Mugnork. A small
&+Wtent stands opposite the Inn, across the snowy path, which continues north and
&+Wsouth. This path looks well traveled, truly the barbarians are a busy people,
&+Wnot letting a small thing like seven feet of snow to get in the way of their
&+Wdaily business.

&+Wassortment of furs and animal heads, each one a trophy captured by the
&+WInnkeeper. This room is usually packed with customers, and is used for a
&+Wlocal meeting place when needed. If there is any gossip to be heard within
&+WMugnork, this is the place to hear it. Everything from the trivialest gossip
&+Wto the most serious of orators are heard here, by the drunkard and hard
&+Wworking man alike. The smell of alcohol lingers in the air.

   A huge pine totem, carved into a grizzly bear, marks the entrance to the
Bear Tribe's sector of Mugnork. The Bear Tribe, mainly containing barbarians
from the northern wastelands, has the honor of forming and running Mugnork's
military. They have been assigned with protecting the settlement from any
danger, and they take this very seriously. Trained from birth for conflict,
the Bear Tribe warriors are some of the most fierce melee fighters in the
Artic, and possibly the world. They are slightly larger then most barbarians,
and have a much higher physical endurance. The Bear Tribe's sector is large,
taking up almost a quarter of the encampment.

   This tent is much larger than any of the other tents found in the Bear
Tribe sector of Mugnork. Beautiful bear hide carpets cover the floors, each
one having been prepared with the extreme care only a master furrier could
muster. Two brass lanterns hang from the ceiling, dangling from thin brass
chain. The flickering light from the lanterns is barely enough to the light
the room, but the only fire visible in this large tent is north of here. A
small round table stands near the tent entrance, its surface rough and
uneven. The table is currently empty, though it is obvious it is used to
hold another lantern. Not many people are allowed inside the chief's very own
tent, and only during certain hours are those select few admitted. This clan
Would rather be left alone in all matters not directly concerning them.

&+Y   Large bear skins hang from the walls of this area, some almost black and

&+Yof this room, casts dancing shadows over the walls and bear skins. The heat from
&+Ythe fire seems more then sufficient to ward of the chilly artic winds that
&+Yblast through this area daily. A wooden table, probably crafted from the local
&+Ypine trees, dominates the center of this tent. Three heavy wooden chairs have
&+Ybeen set up around the table, and a crude map of Mugnork, drawn on a piece of
&+Ydeer hide, lies across its flat surface. It is here that the chief meets with
&+Ymembers of his own tribe and members of many other tribes. The huge tent is
&+Ymore than adequate to house the chief and his many furs and possessions that
&+Ywere gifts from pledging clan members. Another room to the tent is to the east,

&+Yin the air, contain their clothing and extra blankets when the winter storms
&+Ymove in. The outer walls of the tent have been reinforced with thick buffalo
&+Yhide, which prevents the warm air from seeping outside. Two chests, each one
&+Yexpertly crafted, sit against the western wall and are used to hold delicate
&+Yitems which could be easily broken in the harsh barbaric environment. A thin
&+Ytrail of golden lettering has been engraved on the chests, and although it is

A &+WSno&+gwy Tr&+Wail &nthrough the &+gPine&+G Forest~
   Towering pine trees line the sides of this narrow snow covered path, their
fallen needles creating a soft bed in the snow. The trail is packed down,
traveled upon frequently by the barbarians while out hunting or gathering
wood. The sound of birds and small rodents can be heard coming from the forest
depths, and the occasional deer sprints across the path in sure of food. Most
of the bears in this area have been driven away by the barbarian hunters or
shamans, but their has been recent sittings of a few large polar bears in the
area. Shadows are casted along the path, created by the surrounding trees and
offers a hiding place for predators. For this reason most barbarians travel
through the forest in groups of two or more, to protect against danger.

A&+W Sno&+ywy Tra&+Wining Gro&+yund &nof the &+YBe&+yar Tri&+Ybe~
   Large boulders surround this snowy clearing, each one decorated with
symbols and shapes drawn with a crimson berry dye. These shapes represent many
of the Bear Tribe's worst enemies, including the snow yeti and northern goblin
hoards. The normal debris which usually litters the artic landscape has all
been removed from the area within the boulders, leaving only the frigid snow
which covers everything. The clearing, easily large enough to hold over thirty
men at once, is used by the Bear Tribe as a training grounds for their young
warriors. Speckles of blood stain some areas of the otherwise clean snow,
marking places where the training sessions have gotten out of control. A cool
breeze stirs.

   Hundreds of columns of books await those who wish to read. Anything and
everything a person could ask for lies within this knowledge center. A few
couches, desks, and chairs make for easy reading. A huge domed glass ceiling
has a great many ancient murals upon them, paintings as well. A great
architect must have designed this place with a lot of care. One small flaw in
the plans and it could crumble, however, magic seems to play a factor in
this building's creation, because there are undecipherable ruins on many of
the walls and shelves alike. The owners of this priceless treasure must possess
the knowledge of a thousand millennia and be the ultimate historian and wielder
of magic. Knowledge is power and the magi of this tower undoubtably realize
this. Whether or not these books pertain to black or white magic isn't
possible to discern, since unless one can undo the enchantments placed upon
the books, one would be stricken blind trying to read it.

A &+LPo&+Brt&+bal &nto the &+LUn&+Bde&+br&+Lwo&+Br&+bl&+Ld~
   Weapons line the shelves that lay here, every hand held weapon known to man
is here as it seems that these people are experienced in the art of war. These
mages have been taught to destroy people with a simple word, to fight with
them is to tango with certain death. There is nothing that the smithies within
this citadel cannot mend or forge and they are highly skilled and respected
likewise. Any advanced culture must have some degree of knowledge of the art
of war and these cultures must not forsake the art of making weapons else
they'll find themselves fighting wars ill prepared. Many broken weapons and
armaments lay strewn about table tops and counters, their owners expecting to
return finding them mended and as good as new and they won't be disappointed.
The overall scope of this chamber reveals that the blackened arts of death
deals these powerful weapons an edge over ordinary instruments from this
realm, because of the death dealing power forged from the realm they're meant
to send enemies to.

&+WFlowing in too many directions to count and in so few to notice, the sphere
&+Wseems to beckoning for a touch. It has a mysterious glow around it and also
&+Wlevitates in mid-air. Whomever built this place must have intended to return,
&+Wfor whom would leave such magical devices unprotected? Or perhaps this is, in
&+Wfact, the protection. Only those who know the secret of the sphere can journey

   A conservatively small bed remains dormant in the west side of the room. No
one has slept there in a long while, the room however, seems quite alive.
There is no trace of the dust within these chambers that usually accompanies
abandonment. A small candle burns on a desk in the far corner of the room,
alongside a large compartment where spell components are kept. The large rug
in the center the room has an a marvelous design upon it. The design of a
magi with an odd looking face. The mysterious design looks life like, and
appears that at any given moment it will leap out and attack those who it
deems unworthy. A small window protrudes through the room, it's obvious that
the window was meant to hold the viewer while they gaze out of the tower. This
is the sole window of the tower and is fitting that its in the master's
chambers. There are no real luxury items here, however, all that a wizard
really needs are his spell books and components.

   The small underground river that runs underneath this mountain runs off a
jagged ledge and falls freely to the rocks underneath. The white water is
a beautiful sight. What is more impressive is how the water free falls and
reflects light to form a rainbow. The vegetation that grows just above
the waterfall bounces back and forth as water clashes into it at speeds upwards
of twenty miles an hour. The plant growth at the bottom of the shaft grows
freely, wildly, and in many directions. The moisture on the rocks is very
dangerous, making footing very slippery. One fall could be the end for anyone,
because the cavern floor is more than twenty feet straight down. The slippery
rocks aren't the only antagonist in these tunnels, the deafening roar of the
waterfall is equally as dangerous. It makes it nearly impossible to think and
it is very irritating.

   The slippery moss that covers the rock at the base of this waterfall could
be very dangerous. One slip is all it would take for someone to tumble down,
landing on the jagged moss covered rocks. The roaring of the waterfall is
defeaning, one can hardly hear their own shouts in this noise. The whitewater
waterfall is very beautiful however, it contrasts sharply with the rocks and
dirt. The waterfall creates a rainbow, which extends from bottom to top. A
huge tentacle beast swirls its limbs violently as if trying to latch them
upon something. The twenty or so green tentacles encircle the yellow center.
Four green pods protect the center membrane from danger by enclosing it, but
when the moment is just right, they'll open up and devour flesh. Whatever this
thing has been feeding on looks to be human, or at least humanoid for the
skeletal bones are visible in various places. Corroded armor with indiscernable
insignias lay scattered, useless.

A &+rHot &+RLava Tube~
   Lava flows freely here. This mountain must actually be a volcano with
this lava activity, or perhaps it sits on top of a fault. Plates of the earth
clashing could cause a gigantic earthquake or volcanic eruption. If this is
in fact a fault, or even a volcano, then it's going to blow sooner or later.
The lava glows red illuminating the room for all to see. If someone were twenty
feet away from the lava, it would burn their eyebrows off. Anyone closer will
suffer horribly with burns to any exposed skin. Anything that comes closer
than ten feet will burst into flames. This is sort of what hell might feel
like. If someone would happen to fall into lava, they'd melt and become one
with the inferno. The exposed portions of the lava are very few however, in
fact most of it runs underneath the mountain. The exposed portions are little
round holes where the pressure was so intense that it was too great, and it
blew through the rocky tunnel floor.

An&+y Une&+Yart&+Lhl&+Yy Ro&+yot~
   Deep within the mountain's heart one wouldn't expect to find roots, killer
plants, psionicist giants, but yet here they are. The huge root seems to have
grown for a couple hundred years, perhaps since the birth of the mountain
itself. The root is covered with dirt, ants, and various critters. The width
is about ten feet wide and rises a good twenty feet to another section of
the tunnel. Perhaps this root could be used as a ladder. As for the killer
plants and pscionicst giants that wander the these tunnels, the force behind
them must be incredibly powerful, and incredibly evil. Who would summon such
beasts with power enough to destroy anything they come across? If by some means
they should ever break the enchantment placed upon them, they could destroy the
world. But, that just attests to the power of the magi responsible for them, if
he can control a large number of giants with such power, then his power must
be greater than anything living within this plane.

   A root is covered in dirt and little critters run down through the tunnel
to another level on the bottom. The critters that run along the root don't
look very dangerous, just various larva. What is dangerous however, is the
moisture and slime that do cover it, since the root is used as a ladder of
sorts by the creatures that dwell deep within the mountain's heart. The jagged
edge of the tunnel running down could make it difficult at best to attempt to
scale down and could also lead to a wretched death. The tunnel looks to
have been made by a giant worm burrowing through the mountain, the width of
it stretches an amazing twenty feet and the height is even greater, rising
well over thirty. Sounds echo very easily, sounds of rumbling emanate from the
east. There are a few plants growing freely in the tunnel, amazingly these
plants can sustain life without sunlight. The tunnel stretches into the darkness
eastward.

   This tunnel is covered with a strange glowing slime. The glow casts a pale
green light throughout the area. Possibly some sort of magical fungus, perhaps
the beholder of some disease or enchantment that'll infect whomever touches
it with some affliction. The water that the slime drips collects in tiny
puddles on the tunnel's floor, which is quite filmy and sticks to whatever it
touches. The tunnel is quite massive, glowing with this strange glow from end
to end. Loose rocks on the floor give way to any sort of weight, which might
cause someone to fall if they're not careful. A strange smell fills the air,
the scent of mold. A bright light to the east signals the tunnel's end, the
light is almost a blinding one, however, green leaves of a forest are visible.

A &+WSno&+gwy Tra&+Wil&n before a &+CD&+Le&+Cer &+LTr&+Ci&+Lbe&+L Totem~
   Two massive totems mark the entrance to the Deer Tribe sector of Mugnork,
each one stretching well over twenty feet into the air. As the merchants and
artisans of the settlement, the Deer Tribe have a great deal more wealth then
the other barbarians, and it is apparent in the appearance of the heavy tents
that dot the landscape here. Colored banners and elegant furs dangle from the
entryways of many of the tents, either crafted here in Mugnork or transported
from a foreign city. The buffalo-skin used to craft their living areas seem to
be a higher quality then found elsewhere, keeping out unwanted wind much more
effectively.

   The Deer Tribe sector of Mugnork seems to be much more organized, compared

Each of these slender totems is topped with the skull of a large buck, which

well known within Mugnork, though their greed and shrewdness have a way of
shadowing this virtuous trait. The frigid White Fox river can be seen winding
its way around Mugnork. The path here has been built to follow the river's
course, and the two seem to bend and curve in the same places. The cold breeze
is very chilly in this section of the camp.

Inside the &+YD&+Le&+Yer &+LTr&+Yi&+Lbe Stables~
&+L   This large stable consists of a wooden overhanging with several stalls
&+Llining each side. The stalls are equipped with heavy wooden doors, to keep
&+Ltheir occupants from running off into the mounds of snow and possibly
&+Lslipping or becoming hopelessly lost in an artic storm. Piles of straw line
&+Lthe floor, creating a comfortable place for the mounts to rest, and troughs
&+Lof hay provide sustenance as well. Bags of grain hang from large hooks in
&+Lthe walls, next to the well oiled horse gear. No one but the deer tribe have
&+Laccess to these horses, for they are their own. They might in time of need
&+Llend them out to fellow tribes, for a small price, after all, these horses
&+Lare difficult to take care of in such desolate cold.

&+yside of this rocky path, their massive forms casting shadows over anyone
&+ytraveling through the area. A frigid artic breeze gusts across the hole
&+ymarked mountains, creating a horrid wailing sound that carries on for a
&+ylong distance in every direction. The path leads deeper into the mountains
&+yto the north, each step becoming increasingly difficult as the snow drifts
&+ybecome larger and less traveled. The volcano to the east looks very dangerous.
&+yAll types of gases flow out from it, perhaps it's not so inactive after all.
&+yThe barbarians seem to pay very little attention to it, perhaps they rely
&+yon their shamans a little too much to appease the volcano spirit.

A &+yPath &nalong the &+rVo&+Llc&+ran&+Lo's&+L Ba&+rse~
   Cutting right through the Wailing Mountains, the rocky path begins to
narrow as it meets up with the start of a massive volcano. The volcano, known
as Mount Zinbarg to the barbarians, has not erupted for several centuries,
though quakes seem to happen monthly in the region immediatly surrounding
the peak. Mugnork has nothing to fear however, having devoted many of their
shamans to communing with the spirit that resides within the fiery mountain.
This trail, though littered with large boulders and loose gravel, is relativly
safe and used daily by both the silver miners and shamans that pray within
the shrine nestled far above. It is said that the barbarians don't like
uninvited guests. They are a fierce people with different customs than those
that live on the flatlands. The life of these mountain barbarians is rough.

A &+WGiga&+bnt&+Bic T&+Wower &nof&+W De&+bfe&+Bns&+We~
   The tower of defense stretches hundreds of feet into the air. The volcano's
opening can be seen to the north, toxic gas pouring out from within the earth.
The heat in the tower is tremendous, so unlike most of Mugnork. Great windows
open out on each side of the tower, giving the barbarians the chance to see
any invading army far before they reach the WhiteFox river. Built with aid
from the dwarven nation, the tower's structure is probably the most secure in
this region. Huge blocks were used to create the tower, dragged here over many
miles of underground tunnels. The craftsmanship is apparent in the detailed
carvings that decorate most of the tower, displaying griffons and eagles in
flight, as well as barbarian and dwarves allied together in combat against
orcish hoards. The tower's interior is rather bare, leaving only five heavy
wooden chairs and a table to be used by the tower guards.

   The Wolf Tribe, known for their superb hunting skills, is the second most
powerful tribe within Mugnork, following just behind the Bear Tribe. They have
claimed the north west section of Mugnork as theirs, leaving two huge totems to
signify the entrance to their sector. Each of these totems stand well over
twenty feet high, carved from a single pine tree. Snarling wolvish faces cover
the totems, dedicated to the great hunting spirits that watch over and guide
the tribe. The trail leading into the Wolf Tribe tents is much like the other
paths trailing through the encampment. A thick coat of snow covers most of its
gradual curves, but a long line of heavy boulders have been set up to keep
travels on the right track.

the trail on either side, moved there to allow easy access through the
encampment. Totems of various heights tower over these snow mounds, each one
dedicated to a wolf spirit. Large buffalo-hide tents house the Wolf Tribe
barbarians, each one large enough to comfortably shelter a whole family. A
small bundle of wolf tails, bound together with thick leather ords, dangle
above each tent entrance, their presence honoring the wolf spirits and all
the past huskies that shared the tent with their barbarian masters. The cool
breeze in this section of the camp is chilly.

to hold important meetings with his clan or possible buisness partners. The

warmth and comfortable atmosphere that the current resident tries to mantain.
Iron chests take up most the the corners, each one containing the merchant

&+Yby an elder, to insure justice to anyone brought before the council of elders.
&+YFour braziers light the room, one in each corner, their flickering flames
&+Ycasting dancing shadows across the room. A steel door, set with an impressive
&+Ylock, leads westward from the room, to a dark cell where prisonsers are kept
&+Yuntil trial. The justice of Mugnork is known to be heavy, forcing villains to
&+Ypay dearly for their crimes.

&+rMa&+Lin &+rRo&+Lom&n of the &+LW&+Wo&+Ll&+Wf &+L&+WL&+Lo&+Wr&+Ld's&n &+rTe&+Lnt~
&+r   Chief of the Wolf Tribe and master of Mugnork's mercenary forces, Arik the
&+rcurrent Wolf Lord has had little time between his duties to decorate this large
&+rtent with the splendor that the other chieftain tents contain. Simple
&+rbearskins hang from the walls, most of them belonging to the fierce polar bear
&+rthat hunts the northern waste. These heavy skins keep out much of the frigid
&+rwinds and the rest are kept at bay by the glowing braziers that illuminate the
&+rroom. A heavy wooden desk, stacked with papers, takes up a large portion of
&+rthe room, leaving little space for the two chairs and chest that round off
&+rArik's possessions.

Before a&+W Shr&+bine &nof&+b Zin&+Wbarg~
   The path widens as it nears this structure, a stone temple built into the
side of the volcano that towers over Mugnork. Built with dwarven aid, the
shrine was devoted to Zinbarg, a great spirit that resides within the volcano.
Its purpose is to tame it and keep it from erupting. The temple itself seems
to be only one story, though a tower jutting from the north-western section
stretches high into the air. Heavy wooden doors, enforced with thick bands of
iron, protect the shrine from invaders. If Mugnork was ever invaded, the shrine
would also act as a first defense. A slight breeze fills the air, making it
just that much colder. The night mist comes through the barbarian camp during
the late hours, however, it never seems to reach this part of the encampment.

Inside the &+LSt&+Won&+be &+bS&+Whr&+Line&n of &+LZ&+Wi&+bn&+Wba&+Lrg~
   The shrine of Zinbarg is rather large, consisting of a few rooms and a
massive tower. Braziers shine brightly in the passages, keeping the way lit
for the many shamans and spiritualists that work here during the night.
Carpts, imported, cover most of the floor in their crimson splendor, and
tapestries from the dwarves decorate the stone walls. A gentle breeze always
seems to be swirling its way through the shrine, its warm touch warding off
the artic chills that seem to exist even so close to the towering volcano just
outside. The corridor leads deeper into the shrine, while a glowing white room
can be seen.

The &+cP&+Cur&+cif&+Cic&+cat&+Cion &+BChamber~
&+B   This chamber is about twenty feet square and almost completly empty. The
&+Bwalls have been crafted from a strange white rock, which seems to absorb any
&+Blight that shines within the room. Deep within the walls they appear to throb
&+Bor pulsate with energy, almost as if they were living. The floor is bare,
&+Bexcept for a few braziers which send out scented smoke that twirls around the
&+Broom like dancing spirits. The room of purification is used by the shamans to
&+Bcleanse their soul of all evil and corruption, thus becoming a better conduit
&+Bfor the spirit energy they deal with. Shamans have great powers. To wield
&+Btheir power they go through a rite of passage, only thing worse in pain is
&+Bpurification.

Before an &+yUnd&+Lergr&+yound &+LCavern &+gJu&+Gng&+gle~
   The air becomes extremely hot and humid, creating a sticky atmosphere which
is very uncommon. What is even more extraordinary is that a jungle appears to
have taken root in this seemingly endless cavern. Thick and hardy underground
trees create a canopy with sprawling green leaves, each as thick as a grown
man. The trunk of these trees are pale brown, spotted with white, and when
inspected closely they appear to be some type of mushroom-palm tree hybrid.
Large red fruits grow on a few of these trees. Thick ferns grow in large mounds
below the canopy, creating a tangled underbrush. Most of these plants are
black or dark green, though a few have beautiful crimson leaves. Unlike common
jungles, no wild animals seem to live here. Instead the only sounds audible
are running water and distant mine workers.

Within the &+gHu&+Gmi&+gd &nand &+bMo&+Bis&+bt &+gWi&+Gl&+gd~
   Unlike a normal jungle, this one lacks both light and wild animals. Though
the ceiling is well above hidden within a thick carpet of shadows, its weight
can still be felt on those below pressing done upon them with tons of rock.
The mushroom-like palm trees sprout up in huge clumps and tower well over
thirty feet and the highest tree still far away from the cavern's roof. Oddly,
the floor is not made of stone, instead a layer of sandy soil covers the
ground, probably dragged here long ago by the nearby river. The air smells.

&+C   This hut is enormous, about twice the size of the many other huts that
&+Cscatter the mountainside. Used to store mining supplies, crates and wooden
&+Cshelves take up most of its space. Tools, ranging from shovels to mining picks
&+Cdangle from the walls, suspended off the ground by iron hooks. A few crates of
&+Cfood are piled high on the northern wall, dragged down from Mugnork to be used
&+Cby the miners when in need. Barrels of fresh water, gathered from the hot
&+Csprings in the barbarian settlement are piled near the food, and are essential
&+Cto the miners since fresh water is impossible to come by down in the mines. A
&+Cfew torches have been attached to the walls, used to light the storage room

An &+LEn&+ctr&+Cance &nto a &+LSi&+cve&+Cr &+LM&+ci&+Cne~
   Discovered by an exploring barbarian party, who were busy scouting the
nearby underground jungle, this silver mine has since been reworked and now
provides Mugnork with almost half of their yearly revenue. When first it was
located, the barbarians had little idea how to work a mine, and after the
tribe chiefs discussed the matter, emissaries were sent to the nearby dwarven
kingdom. Over the years, both the dwarven/barbarian alliance had grown strong
and with the barbarian offer to share half the profits if the dwarves would
help work and supervise the mine, it grew even stronger. Soon after hordes of
dwarven miners appeared through the underground tunnels, and started creating
the mine's layout. After supporting timbers were dragged in from the forest
above, both barbarians and dwarves began mining. Even after several years, the
silver is still plentiful, more then enough to appease both races.

   The occasional vein of silver twinkles brightly, as light shining from the
flickering torches catch it at the right angle. Though most of the precious
metal has been wroked from this section of the mine, some still remains,
probably abandoned for a larger source. The tunnel walls are rough, having
been worked continuously for many years in the past by the barbarian and
dwarven miners. Heavy beams of pine wood support the ceiling in several places,
preventing any chance of a possible cave-in. A few empty mining carts lie
against the walls, waiting to be filled with sacks of silver or piled with
pebbles to be dragged away from the mine.

Prints from a wide assortment of sources, mainly barbarians, have packed down
the snow, keeping the trail from becoming covered by the heavy snowfalls that
plague this area. Small tents can be seen in the distance, in almost every
direction, each of those tents housing a family of barbarians. Large mounds
of snow flank this trail on both sides, pushed there by the barbarian guards
to give the encampment an easy traveling road. The air is fresh and clean,
very unlike most of the heavily populated cities found in the realm, simply
because the barbarians are rigorous and study, unafraid of working to achieve
that they want and simply because they have the ability to survive on their
own without help from any other culture. The air is cool and breezy high in
these mountains.

   As the spiritual leaders of Mugnork, the raven tribe is probably the
most respected barbarians within the settlement. Their sector is not as large
as most, since they lack to numerous members that the other three tribes
contain. A few scattered tents, each one decorated with raven feathers and
surrounded with bird-like totems, dot this middle-section of Mugnork,
which is populated by the shamans, spiritualists, and medicine men. Many of
the other tribes can be seen mulling around the various buffalo-hide tents,
looking for wisdom or healing that can only be found here. A slight breeze
in the air makes it seem a little colder. The wind chill factor could make the
difference between life and death here, simply because it could make twenty
degrees seem like negative twenty.

snow, several feet deep in many sections. Totems depicting the bird-like
spirits of wind and shaman magic dot the area between the tents, some of them
towering over twenty feet into the air. Black feathers, attached to thick
leather cords, hang from many of the tents and totems, used to ward off the
evil spirits that shamans and witchdoctors have to deal with. The barbarians
of this town do not welcome visitors and it wouldn't be surprising if they
attacked upon site. The smell of freshly cooked meat fills the air.

sporadic dry spots in this swamp, though they are of no use, except for
breeding. A large nest is visible in one of the larger dry spots, a nest made
of dry dirt. A snake's nest and happens to be the nest of the larger of
them, the anaconda. Anacondas could swallow an entire cow whole if it chose,
dislocating its jaw in the process. Anacondas are said to grow as long as fifty
feet, and there have been a few cases of larger ones.

   Supplied with water from the spring, this slow running river lazily
heads southward, towards the far cavern wall. Its water is warm to the touch,
though unhealthy to drink as it contains a wide assortment of minerals
absorbed from the surrounding rocks. Nothing appears to swim below the
water's surface. Its depth barren of all life except for a few patches of
strange blue mold that grows along the rocky sides and bottom. It is nearly
impossible to cross this river without a boat, since the current, though
slow, is still powerful enough to pull a strong swimmer along with it.
The water is well over fifteen feet deep, keeping its bottom far out of the
reach.

   The forest thins out to reveal a river in its midst. Much of the ground is
wet for reasons caused by the water of the river with Weeds and vegetation
plaguing the river's edge while bushes make great abodes for snakes and other
reptiles. Sounds of the river fill the air as well as the smell that rapids
normally bring, the smell of rain. Animals often come here to drink as a hill
slopes downward towards the river and it still rises to the east. The white
water of the river is caused by the ferociousness of the current colliding
with the rocks underneath that one rarely sees. A large rope and wooden bridge
is anchored by two boulders on either side.

trail that leads north towards a large encampment of barbarians. Prints in the
snow, scattered along the path, hint at the sheer size of this colony of
mountain barbarians and the number of hardy livestock they must care for. Very
few plants can be seen, only the occasional clump of yellowed grass, orstunted
tree trunk that pokes up through the packed snow in this region. A thin
glimmer can be seen off to the north, just before the encampment, which can
only be the white fox river, a life blood of the barbarians because it is a
fresh water river that its their survival, without it, there would be no game
nor any fresh water to drink from, making this mountain desolate.

   Pine trees tower high up into the air, their lush green canopy blocking
out large sections of the sky. Dried pine needles cover the snowy forest floor,
creating a soft yellow blanket that seems to carpet everything. The aroma of
trees is overpowering, drowning out all other scents. The trees are thick and
bunched together, making travel much more difficult in its depths. A wide
selection of small forest animals have made their home among the trees, their
loud squeaking and chirping filling the air. The barbarians don't travel this
section of the forest much, due to the untamed creatures of the mountains, who
protect their territory fiercely. Many barbarians have lost their lives trying
to navigate this confusing forest, and a treacherous forest it must be for only
the strong even attempt such a thing.

An &+bI&+Bc&+Wy &+bP&+Bat&+Wh&n leading towards &+CMugnork~
   The snow in this area has been packed down, creating a slick, almost icy
trail that leads north towards a large encampment of barbarians. Prints in the
snow, scattered along the path, hint at the sheer size of this colony of
mountain barbarians and the number of hardy livestock they must care for. Very
few plants can be seen, only the occasional clump of yellowed grass, orstunted
tree trunk that pokes up through the packed snow in this region. A thin
glimmer can be seen off to the north, just before the encampment, which can
only be the white fox river, a life blood of the barbarians because it is a
fresh water river that its their survival, without it, there would be no game
nor any fresh water to drink from, making this mountain desolate.

   As far as the eye can see there is nothing but snow and ice. Frozen water
from years of seasonal rain have accumulated and frozen. Snow sits atop most
of the glades, hiding them from view. There isn't a chance of the ice cracking,
simply because the temperature is freezing all year around. The lake is
probably harder than the mountain itself. It is perilous to travel the tips of
this mountain alone or at night because the much of the wild life is
aggressive. From this vantage point you can see out over most of the forest
below, near the base of the mountain. The barbarians of this mountain don't
like outsiders and it is said that they've been known to attack on sight.

&+GA &+gPlush&+G Green Courtyard~
   This courtyard must have an army of caretakers tending to it everyday.
The
amount of grass and flowers growing is outstanding, and nothing else can be
found like it in the world. Two fountains channel water into the air, giving
access to all who may desire the precious life giving substance. The garden
is
a combination of lush lawn shrubs and trees of all shapes and sizes. This is
certainly a place where someone could always find a nice quiet place to just
sit and ponder life. The great garden is surrounded on every side by either
a
huge stone wall or a castle structure. To the north a large tower looms, to
the
east a gigantic library stands, and the caretakers' dwellings are to the
west.
The only interesting building of the three would be the tower, for it seems
to
be shrouded in darkness. One has a difficult time staring straight at it,
and
if they're not looking for it, it might be overlooked quite easily. The
height
of this tower is unparallel, rising nearly a hundred feet into the air,
built
using a cold black stone, with but one window. The small iron gate
surrounding
the tower is adequate protection against small animals and rodents, but it
could not keep anyone over the age of five out, interesting, perhaps there
are
greater lengths the creators of the tower created to prevent anyone from
intruding, things unseen yet.

walls are covered in a mixture of &+Cice&n, &+rfire&n,&+b water&n and
&+yearth&n that all appears
to be alive. The &+Cice&n crackles and forms what looks like faces within
itself. The fire sits an inch off the surface of the walls and forms
strange,

Finally, clumps of brown &+yearth&n form nasty looking faces upon the wall
and then flatten and dissipate as quickly as they formed. A most mysterious,
yet somewhat disturbing place. If it weren't for the freezing temperature
here,
one might be able to think freely, however, since not even the most cold
blooded reptiles could live here due to the chill. Lord knows this is the
dwelling of supernatural where normal rules apply not.

walls are covered in a mixture of &+Cice&n, &+rfire&n,&+b water&n and
&+yearth&n that all appears
to be alive. The &+Cice&n crackles and forms what looks like faces within
itself. The fire sits an inch off the surface of the walls and forms
strange,
unnatural symbols and shapes. Swirling under and around the &+rfire&n is a
thin
layer of rapidly moving &+bwater&n that swirls and swoshes as it covers the
walls.
Finally, clumps of brown &+yearth&n form nasty looking faces upon the wall
and then flatten and dissipate as quickly as they formed. A most mysterious,
yet somewhat disturbing place. If it werent' for the freezing temperature
here,
one might be able to think freely, however, since not even the most cold
blooded reptiles could live here due to the chill, as it is this cold breaks
concentration. Lord knows this is the dwelling of supernatural where normal
rules apply not.

&+gA Majestic Corridor~
&+G   The tower wall encloses the corridor, allowing only one path of travel
&+Gwith a limited amount of space. Wondrous light streaks out from the
&+Gwalls, its source are crystals and diamonds reflecting all colors of the
&+Gspectrum, making an impressive scenario. Robbers would have a field day
with
&+Gthis area, if not for runes of warding that are humming in fury to
discourage
&+Gany attempt to deprive the wall of their precious jewels. These precious
&+Gjewels cover both walls entirely, but not the ceiling nor the floor.  The
&+Gcorridor is a little over ten feet wide and the height stretches upward
to
&+Gabout fifteen feet, however, a humming sound is plainly audible to the
&+Gimmediate area. The magicians in this tower must have embued the crystals
&+Gwith some sort of power, or perhaps these crystals are the source of
these
&+Ggreat magi's strength. Whatever the case, these crystals cannot be taken
and
&+Gthey possess great magic.

A&+W Sn&+gow Co&+Wvered &+GPine&+g Forest~
   Pine trees tower high up into the air, their lush green canopy blocking
out large sections of the sky. Dried pine needles cover the snowy forest floor,
creating a soft yellow blanket that seems to carpet everything. The aroma of
trees is overpowering, drowning out all other scents. The trees are thick and
bunched together, making travel much more difficult in its depths. A wide
selection of small forest animals have made their home among the trees, their
loud squeaking and chirping filling the air. The barbarians don't travel this
section of the forest much, due to the untamed creatures of the mountains, who
protect their territory fiercely. Many barbarians have lost their lives trying
to navigate this confusing forest, and a treacherous forest it must be for only
the strong even attempt such a thing.

Inside a &+YCl&+yan Be&+Yar&n &+YTe&+ynt~
   Crafted from thick buffalo-hide, this tent can effectively shelter out the
vicious artic weather. Thick animal pelts hang across parts of the tent,
acting like walls to create private areas to dress and sleep. Heavy bear-hide
blankets cover the floor, used as beds and blankets when the wind starts to
pick up. A small fire burns in the center of the room, contained by a circle of
small black stones. The heat from the dancing flames are used to prepare food
and provide light, as well as heat the tent. A few small bundles are piled in
one area of the tent, storing food and extra clothing for the barbarian family
that lives here.

   Although some would panic if they were lost in a forest, no one has ever
done that here. The forest seems centuries old and most of the trees have grown
over fifty feet and their bases look wider than most ogres' waist lines. There
are no game trails nor any other trails for that matter. The trees sway gently
in the wind as if gently jamming to some imaginary music. There are no animals
in this forest, or perhaps they are deeper within the forest. There is very
little sunlight and it is almost as if it is magically tucked away. The smell
of the trees seem odd as well, they smell afraid and look old and twisted. A
small mist obscures the ground and little critters ascend the trees. Darkness
envelopes everything on this small forest path, which isn't very large.

A &+LMi&+msty &+LDa&+yrk &+LFor&+gest~
   Large gnarled tree roots rise from the ground from century old oaks that
are hundreds of feet high. These trees limbs are gnarled and dark, and there
seems to be a bloody red sap profusing all over the tree's bark, and the
discoloration of the veins is apparent a long the lower limbs. All the trees
have thick and sappy trunks that seem to bleed red, but an ominous mist fills
the forest floor, obscuring most of everything. Strange forest critters run
along trees and larger scaly ones with long red tails hang from the branches.
This forest is surrounded by a magical darkness it seems, and even during the
day light never reaches this place. The vileness that infests this forest can
not survive sunlight, and the creatures within can not exist without darkness.
