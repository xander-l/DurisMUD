&+gBefore a Collapsed Long Stairway&N~
   A long stone stairway once lead up a steep incline to the Woodseer plateau high
above.  Stone debris from past rock slides has been pushed to the south to
create a wall of lose stone to help keep some of the jungle plants away.  Paths
extend to the north and south along the base of the cliff that leads up to the
plateau and the wall of lose stone that has been erected to keep back the
jungle.  Gaps in the stones show that the halfling guards have not been
vigilant in its upkeep.

&+LOn a Stone Stairway&N~
   Two people can travel abreast on this narrow stairway.  The stones are well
worn by the passage of many feet and are very sturdy, but there are no
guardrails to prevent someone from falling over the edge.  At this height one
can see down into the lower branches of some of the trees to the east.  Tree
branches throughout the jungle below and to the east are alive with birds and
monkeys as well as other creatures that are not as easy to identify.  The
stairway continues up toward the Woodseer plateau and down to the jungle.

&+LOn a Stone Stairway&N~
   A guardrail would be very nice at this point.  The narrow stairway can only
fit two people abreast and is almost 150 feet above the ground now.  It is easy
to see that this stairway was originally built with security and not safety in
mind.  The only way to attack Woodseer would be to climb the steep rocky
cliff to the north and south or to come up this stairway, either of which are
easy to defend.  Stairs lead up to Woodseer and down toward the jungle below.

   There are no guardrails to keep one from falling off these narrow stone
steps and making a gruesome fall to the base of the cliffs over 200 hundred
feet below.  All the same, the agile halflings bounce up and down this stairway
with little worry of falling over the edge.  To the south a thin waterfall can
be seen diving over the edge of the cliff into a small pond by the jungle far
below.  Stone stairs rise up toward Woodseer and head down to meet the valley
below.

   It is a good thing that halflings don't have any fear of heights.  This
cracked stone stairway is extremely narrow and there are no guardrails to be
seen.  The drop down to the valley below would be swift, and most likely end in
a quick and painless death.  Stone walls can be seen along the top of the
cliff above and a thin waterfall plummets over the edge of the cliff to the
south.  Cracked stone stairs, in dire need of repair, lead down toward the
jungle valley below and climb up to Woodseer.

   Cracked but sturdy looking stone stairs lead down from this tiny landing to
the jungle valley below.  A narrow passage through the Woodseer gates to the
west leads into a thriving halfling city.  Stone walls, in need of repair,
extend along the top of the cliff to the north and south creating an almost
unnecessary addition to the steep cliff face to defend Woodseer from any
invasion. Halfling merchants can be heard hawking their wares and children can
be heard laughing from the other side of the stone walls.

   Rusty gates are propped open here, obviously not in use for quite a long
time.  It seems the halflings either aren't terribly worried about invasion or
are a bit lazy when it comes to upkeep.  Guards patrol the wall above and the
area of the gates watching everyone with more amusement and curiosity than
caution.  An intersection of cobblestone roads can be seen to the west and a
narrow landing is to the east through the open gates.

north and a wall of lose stones and boulders to the west prevents any easy
travel into the park beyond.  Enclosed by the walls and cliffs most of the
sounds of the city seem somewhat muffled, the predominant sounds being shouts
of halfling guards.  A stairway leads up to the top of the Woodseer wall and
the entrance to the jail and Vinestrong Way heads south.

&+LThe Processing Room in the Jail&N~
   Laziness is the true mother of invention.  This natural cave has provided
an excellent jail with a minimum of work.  A large desk sits in front of the
impressive &+csteel door&N in the western wall.  This is where criminals are
processed and locked away.  It is also where prisoners often lose their
belongings to some of the guards.  Stern looking halfling jailers are always
ready to hold an individuals belongings while they are incarcerated.  Of
course, there is no guarantee of their return.  None of the halflings
here has ever been known to accept a bribe.  In fact, they will almost
certainly accept the money and then add that bribery to the list and lengthen
the 'visit'.  There is another room to the north and the impressive &+csteel&N
&+cdoor&N that leads into the jail cell to the west.  An exit from the jail
leads south to the guards' walkway.

&+rThe Judge's Chambers&N~
   A wide jodani wood desk takes up most of the space in the room.  A large
cabinet to the left of the doorway holds legal texts and records of criminals
and their actions.  Lists of known criminals wanted in some of the other
civilized cities of the land is posted to the right of the doorway.  All in
all, the jail is startlingly well-organized and well run.  Jailers and judges
can often be seen sitting around joking with one another, there isn't much
crime in Woodseer.  One of four judges is on duty at all times, ready
to meet out swift justice.  There is only one appeal possible, if a criminal
appeals the decision of the judge he must tell his story to clerics with
detect lie spells.  The first lie is an immediate death sentence, for obvious
reasons, appeals are very rare.  An open doorway leads back into the
processing area.

&+LThe Woodseer Jail&N~
   Dark, dank and generally unpleasant, this room makes a perfect jail cell.
A skeleton has been left rotting on the northern wall to add to the unwholesome
aromas and to serve as a reminder.  Built within a cave in the cliffs the solid
rock of the floor and walls provides no avenue for escape.  Perhaps
a powerful mage could cut through the rock but faintly glowing sigils on the
walls prevent the use of magic within the room.  A &+csteel door&N to the east
provides the only possible exit to this horrible place; however, it is kept
locked and there isn't even a keyhole on this side of the door. There has never
been an escape from this cell, and attempts at bribery will only insure extra
jail-time.  If the guards don't get busy doing other things and forget, the
prisoners get fed once a day.

   The high vantage point of the guards walkway makes it easy to look out over

valley below seems to sink downward but the tops of the high trees may be
misleading.  Guards patrol the entire length of the walkway as it continues to
the north and south.  To the north, is the end of the walkway and the Woodseer
Jail and a guard station can be seen to the south.

   A large ballista has been mounted here pointing straight down the stairway

up the steep rise to the plateau one ballista would seem sufficient.  Racks
along the wall hold ballista missiles.  Everything here has been kept
surprisingly clean and in working order.  One of the guards nearby surveys the
land with a looking glass, a needless gesture for an army could be hidden
beneath the distant jungle canopy and still remain unseen.  The guards' walkway
continues to the north and south.

   A pair of jodani trees on the plateau to the west reaches high enough that
some of the top branches provide a bit of shade to this part of the wall.  The
great height of the wall gives the jungle valley below a serene beauty.  A
quick glance over the edge of the wall shows how steep and unclimbable the
cliff face really is.  The idea of anyone trying to attack the plateau against
these odds is laughable but, if the stories are true, fools have tried.  Guards
patrol the walkway as it continues to the north and south.

   It is obvious that several repairs have been made to the wall here, but even

to sag when they are stepped on.  One of the trees in the jungle below must be
some flowering variety, for bright orange flowers are strung throughout
its top limbs.  Several carts can be heard rattling on the cobblestone roads
to the west and guards can be heard greeting each other as they patrol the
walkway to the north and south.

   It is a wonder the guards don't get dizzy looking down from this height all
day long.  As one looks far to the east the jungle canopy seems to fade into a
green carpet in the distance.  At some points the canopy is punctuated by the
bulge of a particularly large tree, probably one of the giant ebonwood trees.
In the distance a woman is calling out to a child and a halfling storekeeper
is calling out his wares in every language.  Below and just to the south a
river flows through a hole in the wall to form a thin waterfall that
plummets all the way down to a small pool in the valley.  The walkway ends to
the south but continues to the north.

narrow river to flow out over the edge of the cliff making a thin spiralling
waterfall.  A quick glance over the eastern edge of the wall gives a clear
view of the dizzying plunge the water takes as it finally reaches the pool
below.  Glancing over the western edge of the wall the river can be seen to
follow along the southern edge of the plateau before it reaches this point.
Guards patrol the walkway which continues to the north, pausing to look out at
the beautiful sights.

building to the west as they reach toward the heavens.  The cobblestone road is

lined up against the northern wall.  Roots hanging down through the ceiling
have been used to hang weapons and armor to help keep it out of the way.
Guards living here must be fairly high ranking, the tunics hanging from some of
the roots bear the markings of elite and lieutenant guardsmen.  Along the
western wall there is a small kitchen which is well-stocked with fresh fruit
and vegetables.  The only exit is an opening in the eastern wall that leads

made up of halfling craftsmen.  Weavers, blacksmiths, and woodcarvers carry
their wares from their homes and workshops out to the shops and merchants
that take care of selling them.  Thin tazten trees rustle together softly in
the breeze as a few birds argue overhead, otherwise the quiet is only
punctuated by the occasional sound of a hammer on metal.  A slippery

   This small burrow amidst the roots of the tazten trees is the home of the
famous halfling guardsman Jarus.  Jarus is famous for the extraordinary heroism
he has shown in his many battles.  Now one of the senior guardsman for
Woodseer, he has earned more awards and honors than most people have ever seen.
Many of these awards have been unceremoniously tossed into a pile on a small
wooden dresser against the eastern wall.  A small bed rests against the
northern wall and a table and chairs occupy the center of the room.  The
only other decorations here are a small picture that has been hung near the bed
and beautiful carpet that covers the center of the floor.

   Jovial halfling craftsmen walk along the road enjoying the peace and quiet.
Some of the halflings walking by seem to have no destination of goal in mind,
they are just walking along staring at the vines, or the river which flows by
to the south.  A large cottage to the north has a sign hung over the door
that reads&+C "Syune's Fine Jewelry"&N.  A river flows by to the south and
Vinestrong Way continues to the east and west.

&+WSyune's Fine Jewelry&N~
   A halfling silversmith and jeweler has set up a thriving business here.  A
glass case displays several different necklaces and gem encrusted bracelets.
All of the jewelry is made of fine silver that has been engraved and had gems
mounted on it.  Most of the work is really quite nice but several pieces have
obviously been made only for the most gaudy and tasteless of merchants to
flaunt their wealth.  To the east there is a small workroom where all of the
jewelry must have been made and an open doorway leads south.

&+cSyune's Workshop&N~
   Syune creates his beautiful jewelry in this well-acquainted workshop.  Every
tool a jeweler or silversmith could possibly need has been lined up neatly on
pegs along the northern wall.  A miniature forge in the northeastern corner can
be used to melt down silver ingots so that the silver can be poured into
molds and shaped.  Syune's engraving tools are laid out on a bench against the
southern wall along with a few pieces that he is still working on.  Although
Syune doesn't create many pieces, those he does make command high prices, and
keep him quite well fed.  An open doorway leads back into the shop to the west
and a narrow stairway beside the doorway leads down to some living quarters.

only expensive items in this otherwise plain room are tapestries that have been
hung on all of the walls.  Several of them are of the rarest of silks and
must have cost more than everything else in the room.  A lamp stands behind a
small reading chair and several books have been stacked on the floor nearby.

&+gVinestrong Way&N~
   Some of the tazten trees to the north have been cut down to create room for
a small cottage of rosewood.  Roses have been planted along the outside of the
cottage to add to the light red hue of the wood and give the area a fine sweet
smell.  Many of the guards and craftsmen that walk by pause here to admire
the beautiful home as they go about their duties.  Vinestrong Way continues to
the east and west, and the river is to the south.  A small open doorway leads

   Everything in the small cottage is made of &+rrosewood&N with the exception
of a small stove in the northwestern corner.  &+rRosewood&N chairs and beds
seem to exude a faint sweet aroma, as if the wood has been freshly cut.  The
faint aroma of the roses growing outside blows in through the windows making
the whole cottage smell as fresh and clean as it looks.  A narrow picture
against the northern wall depicts two halfling warriors battling a huge
snake-like creature with a human face, the halflings are depicted as
having the upper hand but it is hard to imagine the small warriors actually
defeating such a large creature.  An open doorway leads out to the south to

All the weapons and the few pieces of armor he carries are of good quality, but
none would win any awards.  Jrev prides himself on being able to acquire almost
any weapon a customer could desire, though sometimes it takes him a while.
Built of heavy black palm, the store, which doubles as Jrev's home, seems ready
to withstand a siege.  An open doorway leads back out to Vinestrong Way to the

just to the west of here along with the river.  Several well-built cottages can
be seen to the north.  The river is much wider and shallower further to the
west, halfling children can be seen wading among the reeds and rushes trying to
catch fish with their hands.  River Circle continues to the west and meets a
junction of roads to the east.  A quick jaunt to the south would put one on
the river which looks deep and fast enough that a boat would be wise.

tree bark can be used to weave a number of different things, from carpets and
cloaks and even some types of clothing.  Due to its light creamy starting
color the soft inner bark of the tazten tree is able to hold most bright colors
quite well.  Green, blue and yellow batches hang drying on racks along the
southern wall.  A small doorway leads north to into a small living area and a

   Different axes and saws line the walls along with some special tools for
stripping bark.  This woodcutter has focused his work harvesting tazten trees
for their wood and bark.  The soft inner bark of the tazten tree, if stripped
away properly, can be woven into fine curtains and tapestries and the creamy
brown wood makes good solid furniture.  A permit required for cutting some of
the tazten trees is posted on the northern wall near the doorway.  A jodani
wood bed rests against the eastern wall next to a small night stand that has
been carved from a block of green stone.  In support of his work, the home is
made entirely of tazten wood with windows in the northern, southern, and
western walls looking out over the river that the cottage has been built over.

want any barren tree-free areas.

Windows in the western wall framing the doorway look out over the river.  A
short leather sofa and a leather chair sit in a small living area in the
southeast corner and a bed made of a deep purple wood is in the southwest
corner near one of the windows.  Green curtains frame the windows contrasting
nicely with the rich reddish brown color of the walls.  Two paintings hung on
the northern and southern wall, add to the serene beauty of the room, and
suggest the owner of this small home spent most of their money on the paintings
rather than the furniture.  River Circle is through a small doorway in the

northwest.  The pool then feeds the river that flows along the outer edge of
the plateau.  Water laps against the rocks lining the edge of River Circle to
the north, a short five foot jump down.  River Circle continues to the south

appears to be in need of a few repairs.  Two brass lanterns frame the open

making some of the products look even nicer.  Fine leather backpacks and bags
hang from one wall, and ropes, lanterns and other supplies hang against

perhaps the best store location, of any storekeeper in town.  Exactly how he
keeps his prices so low has often been called into question by his competitors
but at this time he no longer has any competitors.  It is obvious that he deals
in top quality supplies and that his prices are quite fair.  The only exit from

into a large beautiful park that seems abuzz with small children and all forms
of wildlife.  It is easy to see that the park ends to the north in a steep
rocky incline that leads up into the mountains.  Some sort of rock slide once
buried the park but someone has spent a great deal of time and effort moving
the largest boulders and rocks to the edges of the park creating a wall.  South
of here an open doorway leading into the base of the tall jodani tree that

Narrow paths wind through the beautiful flowering trees and bushes and cleverly
made flower gardens that have been planted everywhere.  The park continues to

   A long &+Lebonwood bar&N lines the northern wall with several bartenders
ready to serve drinks.  A small stage to the east is where traveling bards and
other entertainers are invited to perform.  A number of &+GQuivering Leaf&N
patrons are standing around having a few drinks while they wait for their
tables to be ready.  For extremely large parties, and a fair sum of money, the
entire room can be rented.  The &+GQuivering Leaf&N, despite its efforts to be
a 'high class' establishment, has become one of the premier night spots in
Woodseer.

   A receptionists desk marks the entrance to a number of the fine rooms that
have been created throughout the tree.  All of the walls shine with the
lustrous red hue of highly polished jodani wood.  It is said that there are
rooms large enough to accommodate even the largest of barbarians from the
north, if they can pay the rate.  All of the rooms in the &+GQuivering Leaf&N
are well-furnished with the most comfortable of beds and pleasant chairs so
that travelers always wake well-rested.  Special guards ensure that each guest,
and their belongings will be safe, at least until they leave their rooms.  A
staircase leads down into one of the finest restaurants in the land, and a
small doorway to the east enters a tiny reading room.

   The halfling proprietress, Clora, prides herself on the fine clothing that
she sells.  On top of the leather armor that she offers for sale she sells fine
silk and linen clothing of many styles.  Clora is the only one in the area to
sell fine silk brocade shirts and cloaks for those special nights out.  Her
fine clothing, all of silk or the finest linen, lines the southern wall and
leather armor, boots, and caps line the western wall.  Mirrors in the southeast
corner can be used to view clothing while trying it on, and needles and thread
nearby indicate that Clora will be more than happy to make adjustments to get
that perfect fit.  An open doorway to the north leads to the beautiful
Petalrich Lane, further beyond a beautiful park can be seen.

At some time in the past part of the mountain side slid down and destroyed part
of the area.  Since then though the rocks and boulders that fell down have been
moved to the sides of the park creating a high wall of lose stones.  The edge

ducks can be seen to the northwest and an ancient statue can be seen to the
northeast.  Most of the trees here are very small so they allow enough light
through their branches to support a wide variety of flowers and shrubs.  The
park teams with life, as insects of all sorts fly along with birds, squirrels
and other animals.

left to explore above.  There are no spider webs here, either something or
someone has cleared them out or the spiders don't like this part of the tower.
Two slabs that must once have been walls have collapsed against each other
creating a tiny opening to the west which seems like it may lead to a small
room.  The rubble strewn stairway leads down into murky darkness.

   Some of the boulders and rocks in the wall surrounding the park to the north
have been pushed aside to make room for the Woodseer bank which has been built
entirely of heavy black palm.  Guards and heavily armored adventurers travel in
and out of the open doorway into the large jodani tree to the south.  A sign
above the doorway to the south reads "Leelon's and The Golden Hammer".
Apparently, both a bar and a store of some sort lie within.  The pleasant road
continues east and west along long flower beds.

&+LThe Woodseer Bank&N~
   Dark walls of thick black palm make this small building seem almost a
fortress.  Blackened steel has been used in the making of the huge vault that
rests against the northern wall.  A long desk in front of the vault is for the
bankers to accept or exchange money and to keep a careful log of the
transactions.  Heavy commerce created by some of the traveling merchants has
led the bank to enter into contracts with banks in most major cities so
customers don't need to carry all of their money with them when they travel.
Several guards protect the bank, and its funds, but it is hard to imagine the
need with such a heavy well-made vault.

It is obvious that the greatest of care and workmanship went into the creation
of this monstrous collection of heavy steel.  The walls of the vault seem to be
made of separate layers of blackened steel and are more than thick enough to
handle any assault.  Powerful magic glyphs have been engraved on the door and
walls, and there are almost certainly less visible protections.  The bank has
never lost anything from its vault, and it is easy to see why.

&+rAn Entryway in a Large Jodani Tree&N~
   This beautifully carved entryway leads in a number of directions.  A highly
polished staircase leads up and down as it curves along the inner rim of the
tree and an open doorway leads into a room to the south.  The eastern wall is
taken up by a huge carving of a dragon about to pounce on a buffalo.  Loud
laughter and discussion can be heard to the south, along with an occasional
song.  Barely edging out the din to the south is the faint clang of weapons
that seems to be coming from below.

&+YTavern of the Golden Hammer&N~
   Most of the patrons here are halfling guardsmen, sharing jokes and drinks
while laughing at each others jokes.  Other customers include merchants and
adventurers from out of town, all of whom seem content with the ale that is
this establishments only product.  The long bar itself appears to have been
carved out of the tree whenever the room was created and was never cut free of
the floor.  All of the barstools, chairs and tables are made of polished jodani
wood.  Colorful tapestries depicting unnamed battles line the walls and a large
golden warhammer hangs above the bar, whether it is functional or not is hard
to say, but it is a thing of beauty.  An open doorway leads out to a small
entryway to the north.

&+cLeelon's Armory&N~
   Fine chain armor lines the walls.  Chain shirts, leggings, and sleeves have
been hung on pegs along the eastern wall for easy inspection.  Simple stands to
the west display the few sets of plate that Leelon has in stock and some fine
helms.  All of the armor is of good quality, and disgustingly overpriced.
Admittedly, chain armor is a bit difficult to obtain in these parts, but it is
often uncomfortable in warm humid areas like this.  The most prized armor
around is splint mail armor made from heavily magiced jodani wood.  At rare
times, Leelon has one suit of such rare armor to offer and it is always
auctioned off to the highest bidder.  A narrow stairway leads down along the
inner edge of the tree.

design as one heads downward.  A long thin stick stretched along the ceiling
has been magically lit to illuminate the stairway as it leads up and down.  The
loud clanging of weapons play can be heard from below, along with some halfling
curses.

&+rA Large Training Room&N~
   This deep underground room has been created especially for the training and
practice of the guards of Woodseer.  Special magical glyphs along the wall
prevent the use of any magic during training.  Some of the Woodseer guards know
a fair amount of magic and the weapons trainers don't want anyone to use magic
as a crutch in battle.  Halflings have paired off to practice their parrying to
the east and a number of guards to the north are practicing their bashing and
shield blocks.  East of here there is a small private training room where those
with the money can train with the halfling weapons master Graeme, and to the west
is a small challenge room for those that wish to fight duels.

   This small room is used for duels and challenge bouts between quarreling
guardsmen or citizens.  Magic is strictly forbidden in this room, and most of
the battles here are left to their own conclusion, the guards don't often
intercede.  Only rarely do duels end in death, though there are often serious
injuries.  Most of the combatants have had enough ale that they can barely
walk, let alone kill each other.  A large training room can be seen to the
east.

   Graeme, the great halfling weapons master, has traveled to many lands and
fought more battles than anyone can count for certain.  He has retired here to
make his living training the guards and adventurers of Woodseer.  A huge
variety of practice weapons line the walls, though his choice always seems to
be a short sword.  The polished jawbone of a huge dragon has been made into a
small chair in the northwestern corner.  Magical glyphs line the wall, designed
to prevent the use of spells and other magic.  Hooded lamps light the room, but
can be dimmed for training in the dark.  West of here is a large practice room
where many halflings are working on their skills

home to the north has been made with a variety of rare and expensive woods
flaunting the wealth of its owner.  Flowers have been planted along the smooth
cobblestone road adding color and beautiful aromas to the area.  Halfling
townsmen of all occupations travel back and forth along the road which
continues to the east and west.

&+yA Small Halfling Cottage&N~
   One wall of this small one room cottage is made by the large jodani tree
that flanks it to the east.  It is odd that such an exceptionally well-made
cottage would have no lanterns or lights of any sort, but perhaps the owner has
a different way of lighting the room.  The walls are made of a variety of
different hard woods put together so that their grains and colors create a
pleasant, eye-catching pattern.  On one wall an intricate carving has been made
using several different woods, if it weren't permanently attached to the wall
it would be a valuable picture.  A small well-made bed rests against the
western wall and there is a table and a single chair in the middle of the room.
A number of small wood chips line the floor as well as a few small carved
animals.  The only exit from the hut is to the north onto Petalrich Lane.

   Expensive silk pillows rest on all the chairs and sofas and ornate brass
lanterns cast a bright light throughout the room.  All the walls and furniture
have been made from the most expensive and rare woods that can be found.
Everything about the room screams money, but not in a tacky fashion.  Sofas and
chairs are organized to provide easy communication amongst visitors, it is
obvious that this room is used more for entertaining and expressing the
expensive tastes of its owner than for day-to-day living.  An ornate wood door
leads out to the street and a silk curtain covers the entrance to a room to the
south.

   The furniture here, though hidden to visitors, is at least as ornate and

room.  It is flanked by heavily engraved night stands of rare jarrah, a wood
with a pinkish cast to it.  Overshadowing all of the furniture and the silk
sheets and curtains is a large painting on the western wall.  A silk curtain

   Beautiful flowers line the road here before the huge building to the north
that houses the meetings of the Woodseer High Council to the north and chief
councilor Eruffu's home to the south.  The meeting hall to the north is a truly
immense building by halfling standards, most meeting rooms of such size are
made in large burrows to save on time and money.  Petalrich Lane ends at a
four-way intersection to the west and continues west toward the Woodseer gates.
The door to a large home is to the south and an open doorway leads into the

absorb the sound of the footsteps of the many people going back and forth
across the &+Wwhite&N and &+rpink&N marble floor.  Everything in this outer
room has been done on a grand scale.  The ceiling slopes upward to such a high
point that a barbarian could stand on his brothers shoulders and still not
touch it.  A wide doorway to the south leads out to Petalrich Lane and a
smaller doorway to the north leads deeper into the mountain into the meeting
hall itself.

&+rThe Woodseer Council Meeting Hall&N~
   Meetings are held in this beautiful wide hall paneled with the finest jodani
wood.  Against the northern wall there is a raised dais.  On top of the dais
there is a table and five chairs, all sized for halfling comfort.  The rest of
the hall is lined with chairs on either side of an aisle leading to the dais.
Council meetings are held twice a month, unless there is a pressing reason to
hold them more often, and usually end at the &+GQuivering Leaf Bar&N because
there isn't really much for the councilors to do most of the time.  Elections
to the Woodseer council are held every six years, unless a councilor dies, and
the four halflings that are elected chose a fifth individual from all of
Woodseer to act as the Chief Councilor.  Doing this allows the most qualified
person to be picked without forcing them to undergo the ordeal of an election.
An open doorway leads south to a large anteroom where people may wait to speak
to the council.

heavily traveled street to the north can't be blocked out by the simple wooden

on the desk emitting a soft glow, something about the way the seal sits on the
desk suggests it wouldn't be safe to try to take it.  A soft leather chair sits
in front of the desk next to a reading lamp.  Books are stacked neatly on the
desk along with some parchment and a jar of ink.  A large jodani and ebonwood
bed rests in the southern end of the room along with matching night stands and
a dresser.  Colorful curtains line the walls giving the room a pleasant and
airy feeling.  The only exit is an open doorway that leads west into Eruffu's

Lamp shades for the lacewood lamps and the bed spreads are all made of a
beautiful green silk which makes a beautiful contrast with the lacewood of the
cottage itself.  A long shelf along the northern wall holds a number of small
trinkets including carved ivory figures and ornamental daggers.  Two small
windows in the western wall look out toward a long thin waterfall that feeds a
shallow pond leading into a river that flows along the edge of the Woodseer

and cliffs at its western and southern edges.  Lose rocks and boulders make up
a wide wall that encloses a large park below and to the east which is full of

appears half of the building must actually be built into the face of the

out into open space, fine construction and good design make the building quite
safe.  A narrow stairway leads further up toward a higher plateau and heads

&+RCtenmir's Fine Goods&N~
   Half of this well-adorned building has been built into the face of the
mountain, the other half hangs out into the air above the plateau below.
Ctenmir has made a fine reputation for himself by carving a niche for himself
in the fine goods market.  Buzzle and Clora have locked up most of the market
for lesser goods so Ctenmir deals in only the finest supplies.  Exotic perfumes
and fine wines are for sale as well as embroidered shirts and other clothing.
There are many rumors that Ctenmir's shop is simply a front for a massive
thieving operation, but the shop does do a thriving business and some of the
wealthier clients simply scoff at the idea.  A wide window in the southern wall
reveals much of Woodseer to the viewers eye.  A watery frame formed by a river
flowing around the edges of the plateau sparkles as it reflects light.

&+LLuc's Goods&N~
   Luc, one of Ctenmir's closest friends runs a small market for stolen goods
here.  Not only will Luc buy just about anything, but he also sells somewhat
questionable items such as lock picks, stilettos, thin shivs and other small
daggers.  Luc has a lengthy log of all the items he has bought and sold, with
the small question of who they were bought from or sold to conveniently left
out.  All of the goods that have been bought are ready to be sold, though at a
somewhat stiff price.  It might be dangerous to buy anything to recognizable
here though, it would be inconvenient to be accused of being a thief.  Luc's
loyalty to Ctenmir is unquestionable, it is said that Ctenmir once saved Luc's
life and that they have been close friends ever since.  An open doorway leads
into a small dark chamber to the west.

&+LA Dark Hall&N~
   The rough stone hallway is cloaked in darkness.  Not even the simplest of
decorations has been put up here, this a strictly utilitarian hallway built
only to be a juncture between whatever rooms lie north and west and the
stairway that leads up.  The rooms to the north and south appear to be faintly
lit, but the darkness of the hallway somehow prevents the light from coming
very far.

&+LA Meeting Hall&N~
   Cocabola wood has been used to panel all of the walls of this large room.
Unlike ebonwood, cocabola is a dark wood with beautiful thin white veins which
help make the room look a little larger than it really is, and is perfect for
hiding secret doors or compartments.  A long ebonwood table and a number of
chairs occupy the center of the room which is lit by a crystal chandelier.
This is where Ctenmir meets with his loyal underlings to plan his heists.
Ctenmir's arms stretch quite far, he has carried off spectacular robberies in a
number of different towns but he has been very careful in Woodseer for the
guards here are quite familiar with his reputation.

&+LCtenmir's Private Chambers&N~
   Ctenmir has found that this is the only place he feels safe to rest.  His
small knowledge of magic has helped him create glyphs and sigils to warn him of
any guards that might be trying to get to him and to protect him from scrying
and magic spells.  Fine clothes and products are everywhere, from small jade
statues to ancient elven wines.  A soft bed rests against one wall along with a
small reading chair and lamp.  An oddly shaped dummy in the center of the room
provides a practice and instructional tool for the finer points of, er,
'acquiring' things and a series of different locks lines a long wooden board,
apparently another practice tool of some sort.

&+COn a Long Stairway&N~
   The roof of a jodani wood building can be seen sticking out of the cliff
directly below and a number of trees and small buildings can be made out on the
plateau far below.  Water roars past to the west as it plummets over the edge
of the cliff above.  Though the waterfall is thin, the volume of water
streaking down toward the pool below appears to be more than enough to drag a
small boat with it.  The stairway continues upward toward another small plateau
and downward toward a building built in the face of the cliff.

&+gFernwalk Lane&N~
   It appears that in some distant past the top of a mountain was somehow
sheared off and 'dropped' into the rift valley forming two plateaus on which
the halflings have built their small town.  One plateau below, which rests
above the western end of the Rift Valley Jungle, and one here on the remains of
the mountain.  A number of very colorful and beautiful homes can be seen
through the small trees and bushes on this higher plateau.  Ferns line the road
as it heads north and a narrow stairway leads down toward the lower plateau.

&+gFernwalk Lane&N~
   Halflings are inclined to use a wide variety of jungle woods to make their
beautiful little homes.  Although Woodseer is most famous for its jodani and
ebonwood, the Rift Valley Jungle is filled with a wide variety of trees
providing a number of different woods for building.  Dark brown cocobola has
been used in the construction of a small home to the east.  The thin light
brown veins of the cocobola seem to shimmer in the sunlight making the home
appear to be made of marble rather than wood.  &+gFernwalk Lane&N continues to
the north toward some more brightly colored homes and south to a steep drop.

&+yA Small Halfling Home&N~
   Logging tools line the southern wall of this small home.  It would appear
the owner must be one of those few brave souls that treks into the jungle to
harvest some of the finer trees and bring them back to Woodseer.  Axes and
specially designed saws as well as carefully crafted pulleys and ropes hang
from pegs in neat orderly rows.  Though the building itself is made of
cocobola the wood of all the furniture is made of a brown wood with dark black
veins known as wenge.  Four chairs surround a table in the middle of the room
and a small kitchen with an iron stove is in the northeast corner.  A single
bed, big enough for three or four halflings occupies the northwestern corner,
separated from the kitchen with a thin curtain.  Everything in the home is
clean and orderly despite feeling as if it has been empty for some time.  A
single door leads out to the west.

   The steady trickle of a tiny waterfall flowing into a small pool to the
west makes a pleasant counterpart to the birds playing in the trees and bushes
nearby.  A large number of small halfling cottages can be seen to the east and
north.  Most of the cottages are made of different woods or combinations of
different woods giving the collection of homes here a colorful, almost
artistic touch.  Halflings take pride in the creation and decoration of
beautiful intricate homes.  Orchid Way continues to the east and makes a short
trip to the west to a small pool of freshwater and Fernwalk Lane continues
both north and south.

   Orchid Way makes its way toward a small area beside a shallow pool of water
fed by a waterfall to the west and an intersection to the east.  A dilapidated

contrasts sharply with the beautiful well-made cottages that are seen
throughout most of Woodseer and even with the wild orchids that grow untended
by its sides.

   This filthy small hut would, at first glance, seem to be abandoned.
However, some of the empty ale bottles in the corner still smell of ale and
the blankets appear recently used.  The entire shack smells of ale and stale
vomit, whoever lives here takes no care of themselves or their home.  Creaks
and groans shudder through the shack with every strong breeze.  There is a
window in the southern wall overlooking the lower plateau but walking there to
look out seems likely to throw the shack, and everything in it, over the edge
of the cliff.  A warped door in the northern wall is the only exit.

   A ribbon of water falls down the sides of the cliffs to the west feeding
into this shallow pool of water.  The pool rapidly drains into two small
rivers, one of which flows to the south and over the cliff forming another
waterfall and the other heads north along the edge of the plateau.  Small
benches have been set here beside some beautiful flower beds so that people
can come and watch the waterfall, or the ducks playing in the pool to the
west.  Orchid Way heads east from here and the pool itself is to the west.
More benches and flowers can be seen to the south.

You:  NO Contract Will Go Unfulfilled."  Bounty-hunters travel through here
often to look for work and to collect their rewards.  Some of the bounty-
hunters that come through here are reported to be ready to do ANY job if the
money is right but Mathorn himself is reported to seek only wanted criminals.
Open doorways lead north into Mathorn's inner office and south to a cobblestone

   Knowing how some bounty-hunters are shunned and avoided, and that it is
nice to relax after a long journey, Mathorn has made a small bar here for the
entertainment and relaxation of the bounty-hunters in his employ.  Creamy
brown tazten wood paneling has been used on all of the walls and soft light is
provided by some small lanterns on each table.  The tables and bar remain
undecorated to keep a sedate and peaceful feel to the room.  It is rumored
that Mathorn has given permission to his bartenders to kill ALL parties
involved in fights in his bar, though no-one has yet tested this.  A small
stairway leads back down to the office on the first floor.

his success.  The floor has been lined with red marble tiles and the paneling
is made of flawless ebonwood.  A long ivory spear with silver inlays is
mounted on the eastern wall facing a gold embossed shield hanging from the
western wall.  The idea that someone would leave such valuable items so
exposed is almost ludicrous.  It is almost as if he is challenging someone to
steal them; come to think of it, perhaps he is.

may practice their trade away from the public.  The walls, floor and ceiling
are all made of rare light green marble, another testament to Mathorn's wealth.
Glowing stones attached to the ceiling shed light on the entire room.  To the

different spots to provide enough light to train.  Bounty-hunters can be seen
sparring with each other and training on dummies throughout the room.  Patches
of blood on the dirt floor show where some of the training got a little bit
more serious than desired.  Dirt, or blood, gathered during training can be
rinsed off in a large washbasin in the southwestern corner of the room before
exiting to the marble floor to the north.  At the eastern end of the room a

hard to imagine that a halfling like Mathorn could have accomplished half of
the things that he is said to.  Why, it is even rumored that Mathorn once went
so far as to sneak into the troll city Ghore to fulfill a contract.  The
expense of the marble walls he has had placed in his practice rooms
demonstrates that whether or not the rumors are true, he has certainly filled
his share of contracts.  Sounds of sparring can be heard from the large

send a sweet scent into the room with every breeze.   A narrow picture against

   Obviously a halfling hunter or adventurer lives here.  Several different
short bows and small spears line the walls along with a few dangerous looking
traps.  The simple trappings of the home suggest that the owner is simply a
hunter and not a thrill-seeker.  The knives that hang from pegs on the walls,
though extremely sharp, are designed for skinning not fighting and there isn't
a sword to be seen anywhere.  A single small bed rests against the northern
wall next to a plush chair and twisted brass lantern.  Several complex maps
have been hung on the western wall, but they seem to have been deliberately
coded so that only their creator can read them.  All of the maps appear to be
of the Rift Valley Jungle and would be useful to many hunters or adventurers,
if they could interpret them.  An open doorway leads to Orchid Way.

map maps~
The maps are simply difficult to interpret.  At least three different colors
of ink have been used to trace lines and make notations in different spots,
and the ink color, as well as short-hand notations all seem to be important.
The only thing that is fairly easy to interpret is a notation on the eastern
edge of one of the maps which says, "Yuan-Ti, bad hunting."

&+LA Large Cocobola Cottage&N~
   Bright lamps keep the room from being overcome by the heavy darkness of the
cocobola.  Light brown woods of several different varieties have been used for
almost all of the different furniture which includes four small beds and
several dressers as well as a long table and six chairs.  A variety of hunting
tools, such as nets, traps and spears have been hung in neat rows on pegs in
the eastern wall.  It appears that at least one of the occupants must be quite
a hunter.  An open doorway leads out to Orchid Way.

&+yA Bocote Cottage&N~
   Although the outside of this simple cottage was made of only bocote, the
interior has been decorated with paneling and furniture of almost every wood
known, including a few so rare they are unrecognizable to any but the most
avid of woodworkers.  Oddly enough, the arrangement and pattern of the woods
that has been used is organized so that the overall appearance is pleasing to
the eye.  The entire northern half of the cottage is taken up by a large bench
and a well-ordered set of woodworking tools which explains why the style of
woodwork seen throughout the cottage is so uniform despite the different
woods.  Everything in the home is tidy and clean, even the saw dust and wood
chips have been swept up and placed into a small barrel beside the bench.  A
small doorway in the western wall leads out to Orchid Way.

   Merchants can be heard hawking their wares in the small market to the north
and a dog's barking can be heard in the distance.  The ferns that give this
narrow road its name seem to fade out to the north where the road widens into
a large square.  A lumber shed to the west blocks the view of the small river
that flows along the western edge of the higher plateau and the door to a
small auction house can be seen to the east.  Fernwalk Lane continues both

&+yA Huge Lumber Storage Shed&N~
   The shed stretches back much further than one would suspect from the
outside.  It appears only the finest of lumbers are stored here, carefully
guarded by several guards and a lumber salesman.  Almost any jungle wood can
be found here including; black palm, bloodwood, bubinga, bocote, chackte-kok,
cocobola, ebonwood, imbuya, jarrah, jodani, lacewood, osage, purple heart,
wenge and even ziricote.  The halfling lumber men that brave the jungle to
collect these fine woods are highly respected, it is felt that the fine colors
of this part of town are entirely due to their efforts, as well as the efforts
of the woodworkers and wood carvers.  An open doorway leads back out to

from small stone tables that have been spaced around the small square.  Small
trees provide shade and a small amount of shelter from the elements and
lanterns hung from some of the lower branches keep the entire square well lit
at night.  Loud laughter and singing can be over the barking dogs and laughing
children that seem to be running everywhere at once.  Fernwalk Lane heads

&+MThe Halfling Market&N~
   Here in the southwestern corner of the market a merchant is selling several
different varieties of fish.  The stone bench on which some of the fish are
resting has a bit of frost on it so it must be magically chilled to help keep
the fish fresh.  Exactly how the merchant is keeping the dogs that run around
so freely from jumping at his fish is a bit unclear, but none are trying to
disrupt his business.  Simple stone lanterns hanging from the tree branches
above keep the square lit at night when it becomes more of a 'party' area than
a market.  A doorway into the large building to the west is just to the north
of here.  The market continues to the north and east.

wonderfully fresh and aromatic.  Lanterns hang from beautiful flowering trees
growing at each end of the bench to help light the square at night when

flower beds that line the square.  Ornate carvings of horns, flutes, and drums
line the molding of the doorway that enters "Lomar's Dragon Tooth Tavern" to

stage here for entertainers to perform for all in the square.  Of course,
Lomar is the only one that can sell any ale or other beverages to anyone in

Halflings, practical as they are, use this square as a market during the day
and as a party and celebration area at night.  Lamps are hung from the lower
branches of the small flowering trees that line the square to keep it lit
during the night.  Halfling children run about the square creating havoc, but
the older halflings accept their interference calmly, knowing they were once
children too.  Fernwalk Lane continues north and the square continues in all

   Built entirely of heavy black palm this small building looks sturdy enough
to withstand even an enraged dragon.  Whether Lomar actually had a part in
killing it or not is a fair question, but the skull of a large dragon hangs
from the ceiling with its teeth shedding a dim magical light throughout the
bar.  A long bar of dark bocote lines the northern wall blending in nicely
with the heavy black palm of the walls.  A raised stage to the south is used
for entertainers when they come to play, which is as often as Lomar can
arrange so that he keeps his business thriving.  A doorway to the south leads
to another part of the bar and a door behind the bar leads into a private
area.  The halfling market square can be seen through the open doorway to the

musicians to practice without disturbing anyone.  Lomar loves music and
instruments so much that he is willing to help teach anyone that wishes to
learn how to play.  Walls are lined with thick wood and an odd-looking padding
of some sort that helps keep the sound from escaping.  Instruments line the
walls, hung almost as if they were weapons.  A small staircase leads to the

&+RBefore a Red Stone Door&N~
   There is a small landing here in front of a red stone door.  All sound in
the tower is muffled to a mere whisper over the constant hum of the tower.
Powerful vibrations can be felt through the floor and walls at odd intervals
as the hum of the tower seems to ebb and flow.  Emerald stairs lead up and
down the circular staircase to different levels of the tower and the red
stone door blocks the way to the north.

   Tall bookcases line the walls full of texts of every age.  Several chairs
in the middle of the room are being used by several studious sorcerers trying
to expand their knowledge.  Though small the library here has acquired a
reputation for being one of the finest in the land.  Visiting mages are
welcome to visit the library and study the books within; however, a glyph
over the red stone door to the south prevents anyone from leaving with any of
the books.  There is a small open doorway to the west that leads into a
private study and a red stone door leads out to the emerald stairway.

   It is obvious that several of the more senior level mages sleep and study
in this quiet room.  Several bookcases and desks are organized so that each
desk has some privacy.  Bunk beds have been lined up against the walls,
though the beds don't seem to be slept in often.  At least one or two of the
senior mages can be found here studying at any time of day.  A small doorway
opens into a well-stocked library, which is visited by many distinguished
mages from throughout the land.

This level of the tower seems dedicated to the practice of the junior
conjurers and sorcerers of the tower.  Mages can be seen practicing their
fireballs and cones of cold directly against the walls of the tower.  The
tower walls seem to simply absorb the spell energy without any harm.  Long
series of divided study carrels can be seen to the north.  The emerald
staircase continues upward and downward to other levels of the tower.

comfortable reading.  Students can be seen working in a laboratory to the

   Glyphs of power on every wall surround the room with power.  A large
pentagram in the middle of the floor has been permanently laid down in
diamond dust and a number of powerful sigils and glyphs have been added to
it.  Oddly enough, western wall has actually been damaged by something in the
distant past.  The very fact that something was able to damage the almost
impervious walls of this tower is a sign of what sort of powerful magic has
been performed here.  An &wlebonwood&N door that is also heavily laden with
glyphs is in the center of the eastern wall and an open doorway leads into a
small room to the north.

&+GMaluna's Private Chambers&N~
   Maluna is rumored to have been a young mage when this tower was originally
built, and if appearances say anything it is certainly believable.  Maluna
must be the oldest halfling around, though she won't state her age and nobody
has had the courage to ask.  A small desk against the eastern wall is full of
papers and old scrolls and a bed against the southern wall rests below a
strange transparent window through the wall of the tower.  Maluna has trained
almost every mage in the land at sometime or other, subscribing to the belief
that her duty is to teach.  An open doorway leads south to a large room and a
window looks out over Woodseer to the south.

Somehow Maluna has made the thick stone wall transparent creating a window
that looks northward over the Woodseer plateau.  The tower is so tall here
that one can see out over the edge of the plateau and down to the lower
plateau and even the gates to Woodseer.  Though incredibly distant, all of
the details of the lower plateau seem startlingly sharp and easy to see.  It
is easy to see why Maluna went through the trouble of creating this beautiful
window

   Beyond the small cottage to the west a narrow river can be seen flowing
along the mountains that enclose Woodseer.  A little ways to the northwest
there is a small valley that rises into the gap between two mountains just
beyond the river.  A thin emerald spire can be seen thrusting its way toward
the heavens far to the east.  A gray-brown cottage is to the west and
Fernwalk Lane continues north and enters the halfling market to the south.

&+LA Gray-Brown Cottage&N~
   A halfling woodworker must live here for the southern wall is lined with
woodworking tools of all varieties as well as several different varnishes.
The eastern wall is paneled with a faint orange wood known as osage that
seems to brighten the room.  Two small beds and a dresser against the eastern
wall have also been made of osage and they help brighten the room.  The
entire southern part of the room has been devoted to woodworking, a partially
finished dresser of jodani wood with ebonwood inlays rests on a sturdy work
bench.  Halfling woodworkers seem to have two markets, their fellow
halflings, who prefer to see a wide variety of woods, and an export market
that is predominantly &+rjodani&N and &+Lebonwood&N because they command the
highest prices.  An open doorway leads back to Fernwalk Lane.

mountain lake to the north.  Cottages that have been built along the path
viewing the lake and mountains can be seen through the thin trees and bushes
to the east.  Fernwalk Lane heads north toward an intersection and continues
south toward the halfling market.  A small cottage of imbuya is to the west.

clean and well-organized.  A plaque near the doorway is the sole wall
decoration to be found.  Chairs surround a small table in the center of the

along Lakeside Path giving them a beautiful view of the small mountain lake
down below and the mountains that surround it.  A narrow path winds down the
steep rock face to a small pier to the lake itself and Lakeside Path
continues west over a bridge toward an outdoor cathedral and the jodani
groves and east along the lake.  Fernwalk Lane heads south toward the

and the valley that contains the jodani groves.  The river itself is quite

halflings must prefer to worship in the open air.  The bridge slopes upward a

and vast catastrophes that created some of the plateaus and deep valleys that
can be found in these mountains.

   There are only two rules for visiting the cathedral; no worshipping gods
of darkness, and no interference with anyone's prayers.  The cathedral itself
is an amazing piece of work.  It has been built entirely on a single flat
stone that seems cut into the side of the mountain here.  In addition, the
cathedral has no outer walls or ceiling, which is truly amazing because many
of the totems and icons that have been raised to the many halfling gods are
quite fragile and would easily be destroyed by the wind or rain.  The
cathedral is to the north and a wide path leads downward toward the rest of
Woodseer.

&+CBelarr's Quarters&N~
   The halfling high priest, Belarr, lives here in the northeastern end of
the cathedral.  A beautiful view of the lake and cottages of Woodseer to the
east and open to the cathedral to the west this is a tranquil place to pray
and study.  Belarr prays and studies here, as well as holding lively
discussions with halfling clerics of all faiths.  Religion is his life, and
something he is always willing to discuss.  Often he is more than happy to
teach other clerics the deep intricacies of all the spells he has learned
during his long life.  The only furniture in the room is a small bed and a
simple wooden chair, Belarr lets nature do the rest of his decorating for
him.  The temple and its many statues and altars is to the west.

&+gAbove the Jodani Groves&N~
   A steep path heading down into the deep valley below is the only way into
the jodani groves.  The magnificent jodani trees must require special
conditions to grow because there are only three or four trees known that have
been able to grow anywhere but the valley below.  Rarity of the jodani trees
combined with the beauty and strength of their wood has helped give halfling
craftsmen and loggers an excellent way to draw income and trade goods into
Woodseer from surrounding areas.  A narrow path heads down a steep incline
into the jodani groves and heads back toward a junction near a bridge.

   Phosphorescent moss marks the lower tree trunks and roots of the
magnificent jodani trees with a faint green light, but otherwise it is
completely dark.  Leaves and branches have fallen down from above and begun
to rot, providing additional nutrients to the huge trees and making the
ground soft.  Rotting vegetation creates a somewhat pungent odor and there is
no breeze or air circulation of any sort to take the aroma away.  A narrow
path leads upward along the steep incline to exit the valley and small paths
wind amongst the tree trunks to the south and west.

Enormous tree trunks create an almost overpowering feeling if inadequacy,
some of these trees have lived through ages that have been lost to history.
Soft moss lines the bottoms of nearby tree trunks and roots shedding a soft
greenish light.  Though not bright enough to see by, the faint light helps
keep one from running into anything too large in the darkness.  Paths twist

   It is hard to imagine anything growing larger than some of these trees.  A
single tree could supply all the craftsmen in Woodseer for years to come, yet
there isn't a tree stump in sight.  Perhaps the rumors that halfling loggers
have found a way to harvest jodani wood without killing the magnificent trees
are true.  Phosphorescent moss lines the tree roots and trunks helping make
the paths that wind through them to the north, east, and west somewhat
visible.

   A long scar in a tree to the west reveals how the halflings harvest the
jodani wood without killing the trees.  A long cut is made in the trunk of
the tree and the living bark is pulled back to reveal the beautiful red wood
of the heart of the tree.  Wood from the heart of the tree, which is no
longer alive, is carefully cut away in long boards and then the outer bark is
closed up again.  Small amounts of lumber are taken from any particular tree,
but the trees are so large that it only takes a few trees to supply enough
lumber for an entire year.  It is rumored that halfling loggers came upon
this method with the aid of a druid who had serious 'concerns' about them
logging in his grove.  Paths wind through the trees to the south and east.

   It is hard to think of any tree as more than a mere sapling beside the
monstrosities that line this small valley.  Only three or four jodani trees
have been found outside this small valley, and two of those are on the lower
Woodseer plateau.  Sounds of working lumber men can be heard to the northwest
where it seems to be a bit lighter.  Faint phosphorescent moss lines the tree
trunks and roots in the area making it slightly easier to find the pathways
that wind through the trees to the north, east, and west.  A huge tree blocks
the way south but all that can be seen beyond it is the steep face of one of
the mountains enclosing the valley.

&+rA Tiny Home&N~
   There is very little of note inside this tiny home.  It is rumored that a
druid guards the jodani grove and that he has made an agreement with the
halfling loggers that allows them to harvest lumber, so long as it doesn't
kill any trees.  It is possible that this well-hidden home may belong to the
druid of the grove, the bed is padded with small jodani branches that have
been woven together and the blanket that rests at the foot of the bed is of
woven jodani leaves.  The tiny home is basically unadorned, a few nuts in a
small metal pail, the bed, and an ornate ivory lantern hung on a small hook
in the wall are the only visible decorations.  A well-concealed door in the
northern wall leads back out to the grove.

   Evenly spaced posts suspend lanterns throughout the area here in front of
the tremendous tree to the north.  The tree itself is an excellent example of
how the halfling loggers are able to acquire jodani wood without angering the
druid of the forest.  Long cuts are made up and down the bark and outer wood
of the tree so that the dead wood in its center can be reached.  Long boards
are then cut out of the tree and the tree is closed up again and the cuts are
healed.  Halfling loggers sing work songs while they work, supposedly to
comfort the tree they are working on, but the real reason is probably to
chase away whatever fears are brought by the normal oppressive darkness of
the forest.  Paths wind through the trees to the south, east, and west and a
large tree is being worked on to the north.

and reading lamp have been tucked into the remaining corner.  Like many
halfling homes, this small room is impeccably clean and tidy.  It seems a
small family must live together here, perhaps even working together in the
workroom that is to the west.

&+CLakeside Path&N~
   There are no stores or vendors along Lakeside Path yet it remains one of
the most well traveled roads in Woodseer.  One reason for this is that it is
the only route to the farms that supply most of the food in Woodseer but
another is undoubtedly the beauty of the mountains and the small lake that
lies below.  Lakeside Path continues to the west and to the east where it
bends north around the lake and meets a path heading into a valley of farms
and fields.  An open doorway to the south leads into a small cottage.

&+rAn Artist's Cottage&N~
   Easels and a small table with jars of a number of different pigments take
up most of the space in this tiny jodani wood home.  Several paintings of
fish and fishermen are displayed on the wall, as well as a painting of a huge
turtle.  Though the paints and easels seem well organized, the rest of the
home is a mess.  An ebonwood bed in the northwest corner looks as if it
hasn't had new sheets in over a year and a pile of dirty dishes in the
kitchen appears to be growing mold.  A single open doorway leads out of this
cluttered home to Lakeside Path.

painting turtle~
It is possible that the scale of the painting is a bit off, if not, the
turtle that is its main subject is truly immense.  The turtle is depicted
floating in a small pool at the foot of a huge waterfall, with only the trees
in the painting to provide scale, either the turtle is huge or the waterfall
and the trees are tiny.  Somehow the former seems most likely.

   A heavily traveled path leads down into a valley to the southeast where a
few small cottages and some large fields and orchards can be seen.  Lakeside
Path itself curves from west to north as it follows around the mountain lake
below.  The mountain lake is clear enough that sharp rocks from the collapse
of some of the cliff faces and mountains can be made out at its bottom.
Isolated by rocky cliffs and mountain faces on all sides, the lake seems
tranquil and calm, despite the halfling children that insist on hurling rocks
as far out into it as they can.

   Small fishing boats can be seen far below on the small lake.  The lake is
too large to be fed only by the waterfall that can be seen falling over the
cliffs in the far western corner so there are probably some underground
springs that add to its supply.  Wind and water have eroded enough of the
bluff away that the road runs along its edge allowing a clear view of
everything below.  A lacewood cottage to the east twinkles in the light as
the lacy veins capture light and reflect it back in every direction.

   The lacewood walls seem to glisten as the lacy veins reflect the light

curtains highlight two small windows that look out to the west toward a small
mountain lake.  Faint orange osage wood has been used to make a small bed and
matching dresser in the far corner of the room and fine tapestries with
brightly colored patterns have been hung on the walls.  The peace and
tranquillity of the room are disrupted by a gaudy gold and ivory chest that
sits at the foot of the bed.  One is quick to wonder what may be hidden
within such a gaudy chest but the lock appears quite sturdy.  An open doorway
to the west leads back out to Lakeside Path.

   This small cottage of light brown bubinga wood is full of carving tools of
every shape and size.  The woodcarver that lives here must be VERY serious
about his trade.  Furniture made of every different type of wood imaginable
lines the room.  Intricate carvings line the face of every drawer in the
small desk and dresser, and the headboard and foot board of the bed have also
been carved.  The entire eastern wall of the cottage has been turned into a
work of art.  Exactly how long it would take someone to carve the scenes
depicted in the wall mural is hard to imagine for the work is full of small
incredibly detailed figures and objects.  A small ladder leads up to a deck
that has been built on the roof and an open doorway leads out to Lakeside
Path.

mountain lake that much of the fish eaten here in Woodseer comes from.  All
of the furniture, though of several different woods, matches nicely and has
been highly polished giving everything in the home a fine sheen.  Lakeside

the walls and each other in a horrifying fashion.  Perhaps the owner of this
cabin is color blind, or maybe there is no owner at all.  Aside from the
table and chairs, which seem to be stuck to the floor, there are no other

magical talent with stone rather than to create a functional cabin.  An open

&+rInside a Pink Stone Cabin&N~
   Smooth pink marble has been used to line the walls of this flawless cabin.
The marble has been used as if it were wood paneling, lining the walls and
ceiling.  Where the marble came from and how it was bonded to the granite
walls is impossible to determine.  The corners all have smooth rounded edges,
as if the marble came in one square-shaped piece just to line the cabin
walls.  Even stranger though, the spotless room is completely devoid of
furniture.  There is not one single piece of furniture or kitchen equipment
anywhere in the room.  An open doorway leads back out to a smooth cavern.

&+BInside a Blue Stone Cabin&N~
   This windowless cabin has been lined with a beautiful blue stone that is
joined at every corner without a single flaw or joint.  Even the floor is of
this odd blue stone.  Two blue stone chairs in the middle of the room sit
facing one another, they appear to be bound permanently to the floor, though
exactly how is a mystery.  There is no kitchen or bed, or really anything
else here, which is odd because the room has none of the dust or signs of
abandonment one would expect with such a lack of furnishings.  A small
doorway exits out to a smooth stone cavern to the north.

   An oddly shaped doorway leads into a small stone cabin to the east and the
cavern itself extends to the north and south.  At times, the walls and floor
seem to vibrate with energy but the impression soon fades and nothing else
can be detected.  Smooth stone lines the walls and ceiling, unmarred by tool
marks or junctions in the stone, a truly amazing feat of workmanship.

&+GInside a Green Stone Cabin&N~
   The mastery of stone work is clear from the inside.  The walls of this
cavern have been lined with a greenish granite that has been smoothed to
perfection.  There are no windows here, just the one doorway out.  Several
marble chairs line the walls, oddly though, they are melded somehow to the
stone of the floor.  The entire room is free of any dust suggesting it has
been in recent use, but there are no beds or tables, or even a kitchen.  The
only exit appears to be an open doorway leading out to a smooth cavern.

   Strange twisted statues line the smooth cavern.  All of the statues show
the same beautiful stonework of the cavern walls and the stone cabins but yet
have a certain lack of artistry.  It is as if the creators of the statues
were simply demonstrating their skill with stone, with little care for
details or authenticity.  Some of the statues, though of different colored
stones beautifully melded together, are impossible to identify.  The cavern
continues toward some more statues to the east and heads west where it bends

Although the soil is quite rich, wheat doesn't seem to grow well here so only
a few fields have been devoted to its growth.  The wheat fields, because they
are so few and grow so poorly are carefully watched by the farmers.  Rabbits
and birds are chased away as quickly as possible to give the struggling wheat
a better chance to grow.  Green beans grow in the fields to the west and
wheat has been planted to the north.  Pear trees are growing along the

&+rAmong the Peach Trees&N~
   Peaches are softer and more susceptible to attack from birds and fruit
bats so they are protected a little more carefully by the farmers.  Like all
the plants in the valley, the peach trees have been well-cared for and are
very productive.  The trees continue south where they surround the entrance
to a small storage shed, wheat fields can be seen to the west, and an open
doorway enters a small cottage tucked into the corner of the valley to the
north.

&+yA Small Farmer's Cottage&N~
   A small ladder and some pruning tools hang on pegs along the western wall,
showing that the farmers that live here must help care for the trees of the
valley.  A heavy bed that appears to have been carved out of a single tree
trunk stands in the northeast corner and a small kitchen and dining table
take up the southeast corner.  By halfling standards, the home is plain and
boring using none of the beautiful woods that are used in many of the
halfling cottages.  An open doorway to the south heads out to rows of peach
trees.

&=yMA Garish Cottage&N~
   Ugly wall hangings lend a garish note to what would otherwise be a well-
organized home.  Threads of silver and gold intertwine with silk and linen
threads creating wall-hangings whose details are simply obscured by the
bright dyes that have been used.  Though the beautifully crafted furniture in
the home is of several rare woods; the colors clash and create the image of
an individual that bought them only for their expense and not out of true
taste.  Farming tools hang from pegs beside the open doorway that leads out
of the brightly colored home to some pear trees to the west.

wall hangings tapestries~
Expensive materials have been used throughout all of the tapestries, the
problem is that they do not combine well.  Threads of silver and gold are
simply too heavy to wind through think silk threads and the bright dyes of
the linen threads that were also used have faded much more slowly than the
dyes of the silk threads leading to a disgusting clash of colors.  The
tapestries were undoubtedly horribly expensive, but now appear to only be a
testament of someone's wealth.

&+yA Large Storage Shed&N~
   Storage bins line the walls of the shed, which is really more of a giant
burrow in the side of the mountain.  Jodani wood walls and a sturdy door make
up the western wall but the rest of the shed has simply been carved out of
the mountain.  This is where the farmers store their produce until they are
able to take it to market.  A heavy wooden door to the west keeps the birds
and rabbits out of the shed protecting the food that is stored here.

&+CA Narrow Path Leading Down to a Mountain Lake&N~
   A rocky path winds down the sharp incline to a small mountain lake.
Halfling children on the bluff above are throwing stones far out into the
lake to watch them splash into the water.  On the lake itself there are
several halfling fisherman in canoes and small boats patiently catching what
they can.  The narrow path continues downward toward the lake and upward to
Lakeside Path.

   A narrow path continues down to a small pier and leads upward toward town.
A small shop sits precariously on a ledge to the east offering small canoes
and fishing gear for sale.  It is easy to see that the lake below is
completely enclosed by tall mountains helping to explain how sounds seem to
echo and penetrate so well.  Halfling children high above to the east can be
heard almost as clearly as if they were only twenty feet away.  The path
continues both up and and down and an open doorway leads into a small shop to

&+YA Small Bait Shop&N~
   More of a shack than a shop, the wrinkled proprietor doesn't seem to offer
much other than canoes and fishing poles.  Built completely on the narrow
rock ledge, the shack has no floor and seems flimsy enough that a good solid
storm would just wash it into the lake.  On closer inspection, the shack does
seem quite recently built, perhaps others have washed into the lake.  An open
doorway to the west leads to a steep path that leads from the lake to the
town above.

&+yOn a Floating Pier&N~
   Magnificent engineering and construction went into the building of this
small pier.  Anchored to the steep rock walls, the pier floats on the water,
easily able to compensate for the high water levels caused by spring rains
and the low water levels during the dry seasons.  Boats can be launched into
the small mountain lake either to the east or the north.  The lake water
itself looks quite deep and chilly, which is odd considering how hot the
weather is here.  A narrow path leads up the slope to town and the small
mountain lake extends to the north and east

   Whether it is the cool water or something about the lake itself is
uncertain, but the fish in this lake are huge.  Even white perch, normally
fairly small, are quite large.  Several freshwater salmon and some sturgeon
and even a few muskies can be seen swimming in different parts of the lake.
Some of the fish appear to be feeding on the eggs and larvae of mosquitos and
some of the gigantic dragonflys that make their homes here.  The lake
continues to the north and a floating pier can be seen to the west.

   Water tumbles down the steep, jagged rock faces to the southwest.  Noise

attracting a large number of fish to the area.  More tranquil water can be

water extends in every other direction.  To the north, closer to the center
of the lake, huge fins occasionally break the surface.  The lake itself is
clear enough that the sleek silver shapes of a number of different fish can
be seen swimming around.  The water here is extremely deep, and some of the
fish here are large enough to make a meal out of almost anything so it
wouldn't be wise to go swimming.  Clear water continues to the north, east,

   A waterfall to the south creates an awe-inspiring sight as waterdroplets
reflect light into thousands of tiny rainbows.  Fortunately, the water does
not spray this far north, anyone any closer to the waterfall would certainly
be in for a soaking.  A recent collapse of the cliffs above has left the
water a bit shallower here and some of the smaller fish hide among the
shattered rocks trying to avoid being eaten by the larger fish of the lake.
The lake continues toward a waterfall to the south and out to the middle of
the lake to the east.  Jagged cliffs enclose the lake to the northwest.

The more avid and risky fishermen fish out here closer to the deep part of

lake is so large that it can eat a halfling whole.  Despite the rumours,
nobody has ever fallen victim to such a fish, though some fishermen have
fallen out of their boats and drown.  The lake continues to the south, east,

&+BOn a Narrow River&N~
   Steep rock inclines surround the river here making it impossible to exit
it here but the depth of the river keeps the current slow and gentle so it is
easy to travel along the river to the north or south.  Buildings line the
sides of the river to the east and the mountains guard the west.  Several
small fish swim back and fort along the river looking for a quick meal.

&+BOn a Narrow River&N~
   A huge building of black palm lines the shore to the east, it can only be
Lomar's Dragon Tooth Tavern, nobody else would build such a large building.
The river itself flows from south to north as it heads from a small pool to
the south toward the deep lake to the north.  The pool that is further to the
south appears to be adjacent to a small park and fed by a tremendous thin
waterfall that tumbles from the mountains above.

&+BOn a Narrow River&N~
   Sounds of merchants selling their wares and hearty laughter filter down
from the halfling market to the northeast. A number of buildings can be seen
along the river as it flows to the north and to the south there is a small
shallow pool of water fed by a waterfall plummeting from the mountains above.
A large building to the east appears to be some sort of storage shed for
there are no windows in it on this side and most of the homes along the river
have windows looking out.  The river meets a shallow pool to the south and
continues north.

&+BIn a Shallow Pool&N~
   A violent waterfall to the west tumbles down from the mountains above to
feed into this small pool.  Though wide, the pool is shallow enough to wade
into, despite the heavy currents and eddies that spin around as it decides to
flow out into small rivers to the north and south.  Small benches and
flowering trees surround the pool to the east where a number of halfling
parents stand by as their children decide to enter the pool and tease the
ducks and turtles that make their homes here.

   Deceptively thin the stream of water from above falls out over clear space
not even touching the mountain walls as it plummets toward the pool.  As it
hits the pool water splashes everywhere creating strong eddies that swirl the
water in every direction.  As the water fills the small pool it rapidly flows
out a river to the northeast and another that heads south to fall down to the
lower plateau.  The splashing water make it difficult to see but the pool
seems to continue to the south and east.

   A powerful waterfall to the northwest fills the pool so swiftly that the
water rapidly flows out two rivers, one to the north and another just to the
southwest which rapidly becomes another waterfall spiraling down to the lower
Woodseer plateau.  Several small park benches have been set around the pool
to the east so that people may relax and watch the waterfall as well as the
ducks swimming around the pool.  Shallow water extends to the north and west
and a small park is to the east.

   All of the reeds growing here in this part of the pool seem to slant
toward the south as a small current seems to pick up in that direction
becoming a small river that soon drops over the edge of the upper plateau
forming another waterfall.  Water roars downward in a waterfall to the north
which fills the pool and supplies enough water to power both the river
heading south and another river that heads north out of the pool.  The pool
continues to the north and east and a river heads south.

   The river, though small, is shallow and fast moving, reaching the edge of

of safety but just to the south is the edge of the waterfall and a sickening
drop to death.  The river continues to the south and a shallow pool can be
seen to the north.

   A wide shallow pool extends to the south and east away from the harsh
spray of the waterfall.  Water droplets fall throughout the area due to the
many jagged rocks the waterfall tumbles over on its way down to the surface.
The water droplets make it difficult to make out many details of the
surrounding pool by refracting any light into thousands of tiny rainbows
making the mist even more difficult to see through.

   Angry water slaps against the confines of the narrow walls as it shoots
eastward.  Muddy banks to the north would be to steep and slippery to climb
even if the water were calm, though odd looking drag marks through the mud
make it look as though some have tried.  Treacherous river water swirls to

   It is hard to imagine waters more treacherous than these, jagged cliff
walls to the south serve as punching bags to the angry river as it attempts
to break free.  Even at this point the river seems to narrow some, driving
the swift flowing water even more quickly eastward.  The river continues to
the east and west, and a steep river bank to the north looks easy to slip
down and impossible to climb back up.

   Rocks glisten with moisture as the angry water pummels them, tearing apart
anything unlucky enough to have fallen over the edge.  As the water shoots

pine building is strictly a ultilarian auction house.  The auctioneers are
fair and the guards that watch the area insure honest transactions, but it is
well-known that this safety ends at the doorway.  A wooden table in the back
of the room is used to display the items up for bid and a small podium beside
it is used by the auctioneers to take bids.  Fernwalk Lane passes by the door
to the west.

&+gA Cleared Path Through the Jungle&N~
   A steep cliff rises upward to the Woodseer plateau.  The halflings that
live in the city high above have pushed some of the rock that has fallen from
the sides of the cliff to the east creating a wide wall of lose rock.  All of
the jungle plants have been kept cut back to create a wide clearing that leads
up to the base of the cliff so that the guards on the walls above can easily
see any attackers that may be so foolish as to attack the sheer cliff walls.
The base of a long narrow stairway that leads up to the plateau is further to
the south.  Several halfling guards can be seen patrolling the open ground here
as it heads south along the cliff.  An opening in the wide wall of lose stone
to the east heads into the jungle and a narrow path winds up into the mountains
to the north.  The cleared path along the base of the cliff continues to the
south.

&+gA Clearing at the Base of a Cliff&N~
   The halfling city, Woodseer, has been built on a plataeu high above this
point.  The city is well-protected by the steep cliff that rises upward to the
west, as well as the tall wall that has been built at the top of the cliff.
Further protection has been created through the clearing of the area along the
base of the cliff of all jungle plants, and even the lose rocks and shale that
have fallen from the cliff in rock slides.  This clearing gives the guards on
the wall high above a clear field of fire in case of attack, and helps
merchants feel more confident about traveling near such a dangerous jungle.
Additional protection is created by the lose rocks themselves which have been
pushed to the east forming a low wall of lose stone that is slippery and
difficult to traverse quickly.  The clearing continues to the north and south
and the jungle can be reached through the wall of lose stone to the east.

   Just south of here is the narrow stairway that provides the only entrance
to the halfling city, Woodseer.  The stairway is well-guarded, and quite easy
to defend.  Woodseer itself is built on a series of plateaus that are high
above the floor of this jungle valley and very easy to defend.  The cliff
that leads up to the plateau to the west is steep and treacherous, with lose
rocks and gravel making it almost impossible to climb.  Anyone seen attempting
to climb the cliff is shot by the well-armed guards that patrol the wall that
has been built at its top.  The only way into Woodseer is the narrow stairway
to the south, and guards insure that unwanted visitors are turned away.  The
clearing along the base of the cliff continues to the north, a stairway is to
the south, and a low wall of lose gravel can be climbed through to enter the
jungle to the east.

base of the steep cliff to enter a steep gorge that makes its way out of the
mountains.  Lose rocks that have fallen from the cliff above have been shoved
to the east to create a low wall of lose stones that provides additional
protection from the jungle creatures who prefer the dark humid confines of
the rain forest.  Periodically, slow breezes cause the humid stench of the
jungle to seep in from the east, reminding travelers that all is not perfectly
safe here.  A well-travled pathway continues south toward a towering waterfall
that shoots down from the plateau above and the stairway leading up to Woodseer
is to the north.

   Jagged stones and loose gravel line the steep cliff to the west that leads
up to the halfling city of Woodseer.  Jungle plants have been cleared away
from this area, and rocks that have fallen from the cliff above have been
pushed to the east making a low wall of lose rocks.  This cleared area has
obviously seen a great deal of use as a merchants passage.  Halfling guards
can be seen patrolling the road immediately beneath the cliff and along the
waterfall that can be seen further south, and the ruts of wagon wheels have
been left behind in the soft ground.  The road continues to the south where
it bends around a pool that is fed by the towering waterfall that tumbles
down from the Woodseer plateau, and to the north where it eventually meets the
single stone stairway that leads into Woodseer.  A stone doorway to the
west leads into a stable of some sort built in a cave in the cliff.

   A towering waterfall to the south plummets into a deep rock-lined pool,

to the south as well as anything else in the area.  Water also sprinkles the
steep jagged stones of the cliff to the west, making the already unclimbable
wall even more treacherous.  It is clear from this vantage point that the city
built on the plateau ontop of the cliff to the west is in an easily defended
area, more by nature's design than anybody elses.  The jungle has been cleared
away from the base of the cliff here creating a well-used trade path that heads
north toward a stairway that leads up the cliff and heads east around the deep
rock-lined pool to the south.  A low wall of lose rocks can be climbed over to
the west to get into the jungle, though few actually choose to enter its dark
and dangerous depths.

jungle helping to keep the road free of the dangerous creatures that make the
jungle their home.  A huge waterfall to the west feeds the deep rock-lined
pool below, splashing water even out as far as this point as it plummets
downward.  The trade path continues to the north where it bends around the
pool to run along the base of the cliff to the west, and to the south where
it begins to climb out of the valley through a narrow gorge.  The stench of the
jungle wafts in from the east, with a smell as dark and foreboding as the

&+gA Trade Path Cut From the Jungle&N~
   Jungle vegetation of all forms has been cleared away from this point to
create a safer passage into and out of the narrow gorge that rises out of
the valley to the south.  This trade path is well-guarded by halfling scouts
and sentries that do there best to keep it safe.  The halfling city of
Woodseer is dependant upon the trade that this path provides and pay for all
of its upkeep.  The trade path continues to the north along a rock-lined pool
as it heads toward Woodseer, and south where it enters a narrow ravine that
climbs out of the valley.  The jungle can be entered to the east, for those
foolish enough to want that type of adventure.

&+LOn a Trade Path in a Narrow Ravine&N~
   Walls of jagged rock surround this narrow ravine and the trade path that
runs through it.  Merchants doing business with Woodseer must risk traveling
alongside the jungle in the valley below but that part of the journey is kept
relatively safe by the halfling scouts and sentries that have been posted
along the road.  This part of the trip though is somewhat tedious and boring.
Steep rock walls and the surrounding mountains block out the direct sunlight
at all but high noon making the trip gloomy and depressing, however, by the
same token, those same high walls keep the narrow path safe from thieves and
other more dangerous creatures.

   Imposing rock walls thrust upward along the sides of the narrow path.  The
path itself is quite smooth and, though the grade is steep, is relatively
easy to climb.  More heavily used than many paths of this type this trade
route is kept relatively safe by the sheer rock walls that surround it.  It
is also clear that the mountains that appear so huge from this low vantage
point, must have been created at the same time as the deep valley below.  The
trade path continues upward to the south and heads down toward the Rift Valley
Jungle to the north.

   This steep path seems to plummet downward as it heads into the Rift Valley
Jungle to the north, and makes a steep climb up to the south.  Despite the
steep grade of the trade path, it has been kept quite smooth and easy to
travel.  It is clear that the halflings that live in Woodseer next to the Rift
Valley Jungle want to insure that traders and merchants can find their way to
their fine city.

   The small hills that surround this narrow path rise up so steeply that the
path seems trapped within them.  Even stranger is the fact that the path drops
down so rapidly that what appear to be small, though rocky, hills from this
point appear to surround a very deep valley that is far, far below.  The path
continues its climb upward and heads downward to eventually lead to Woodseer.

   It is fortunate that this path is well-kept because it is quite steep here
and a poorly kept path could cause problems for merchant carts and wagons.
Steep rocky hills extend upward to the sides of the path, making it seem quite
cramped and uncomfortable, yet also offering a great deal of protection by
making it impossible for thieves to set up any ambushes here.  The path
continues down toward a deep valley and heads upward toward a small forest
clearing.

&+gA Trade Path Heading into a Ravine&N~
   This narrow trade path heads down into a ravine that makes a sharp drop
down into the hills to the north.  The steep descent shows that what appear to
be unassuming hills here must become some fairly imposing mountains further to
the north.  A number of small juniper bushes and a few small trees dot this
area as the path heads south toward a small forest clearing.  Dank, humid air
seems to struggle its way out of the ravine to the north, where the narrow path
makes its steep descent, but otherwise this area is quite peaceful and calm.

&+LOn a Wall of Lose Rocks&N~
   It is more of a pile of lose rocks than a true wall, but it has been
maintained so that the jungle has a difficult time trying to overcome it.  A
wide clearing to the west extends south along the base of a high cliff.
Halfling guards can be seen patrolling the cleared area, and sometimes even
this area.  Immediately to the east there is a light jungle, light because it
must once have been almost completely destroyed and has only recently grown
back.  Halfling scouts and sentries patrol the jungle far enough to ensure
the safety of their village.  Beyond that point, the jungle has been allowed
to grow in whatever twisted fashion it desires.  The wall of lose rocks
continues to the south, there is a wide clearing to the west, and the jungle
is to the east.  A steep mountain face blocks the way to the north.

   The lose rocks make footing quite treacherous, walking along the clearing
to the west would be much safer, and wiser.  The jungle to the east is
relatively sparce and most of the growth looks fairly recent.  None of the
trees that can be seen from here appear to be more than twenty-five years
old.  It almost looks as if there was some great battle fought there and that
most of the jungle was destroyed as a result.  Halfling scouts can be seen
patrolling the clearing to the west, and can occasionally be seen through the
jungle growth to the east.  The wall continues to the north and south, the
jungle lies to the east and a much safer looking clearing is to the west.

   Stones have been piled much higher here, and are much more precarious.
One misstep and one could fall in a rockslide and get seriously injured.  The
rocks to the south have been deliberately piled so loosely that they would be
almost impossible to climb through with any safety.  Halfling scouts can be
seen patrolling the young jungle that lies to the east and the clearing along
the base of a cliff to the west.  Lose rocks continue to the north, but the

   Though the rocks to the north and south are piled so precariously that
travel through them is almost impossible, the rocks here have tumbled a bit
and allow a fairly easy route into the jungle to the east.  A clearing along
the base of the cliff that can be seen to the west is obviously a heavily
used trade path, and a number of halfing guards and scouts can be seen
patrolling it to keep the merchant caravans safe.  A waterfall to the
southwest emits just enough of a roar to drown out the sounds of the birds
and other creatures of the jungle.  Halfling scouts patrol the jungle as far
to the east as they are able, to try to keep the loggers and hunters from
Woodseer that make their livings in the jungle a little bit safer.  It is
clear that they can't patrol to far though, the jungle just gets too
dangerous.

   A jagged cliff to the north seems barely able to withstand the rapidly
growing jungle plants.  In fact, one large root has already found a crack in
the stone and forced its way into it.  Rotting vegetation adds its stench to
the dank humid air of the jungle, making an already uncomfortable area even
worse.  It is clear though that this part of the &+gRift Valley Jungle&N is
made up of mostly new growth.  Something must have killed most of the jungle
a few years back and it is taking even these rapidly growing plants some time
to recover.  Light from the sun is actually able to make its way to the
ground here during the day.  The gloomy humid jungle continues to the south

overhead, dangling from long green tendrils.  Sounds of different birds and
animals calling to one another through the jungle can be heard, at times it
seems a cresendo, yet often it seems deathly quiet.  Growing near the rotting
stump of a once huge tree are several small ebonwood trees, not quite large
enough to become lumber yet.  There are no paths here, the rapidly growing
jungle wipes out paths in an instant.  Soft humus, roots and vines lay across
the ground as the jungle continues to the north, south, and east, and there
is a low wall of lose rocks to the west.

   This close to Woodseer the jungle is considered relatively safe, but there
are only a few scouts and sentinels for a huge area.  It really isn't much
consolation to know that whatever kills you might die at their hands
afterward.  Young jungle plants fight each other for as much sun and space as
they can manage and animals of every size, shape, and form are ready to take
advantage of every opportunity for survival.  It is clear that some disaster
must have hit this area of the jungle within the last twenty years or so,
none of the trees or plants in the area is much older than that.  Most
likely, battles for the defense of Woodseer may have taken place here and
mages had to burn much of the jungle away.  The humid jungle continues to the
north, south, and east, and there is a low wall of lose rocks to the west.

had to go to the bathroom throughout days of battles and adventures.  This
part of the jungle is dank, humid, and smells as if EVERYTHING in the jungle
has used this area as a bathroom.  Soft humus gives off additional powerful
odors with every single step.  Birds, monkeys, and other jungle animals can

   A bit more light than usual seeps in here during the daylight hours due to
the clearing to the south and the low wall of lose rocks to the west.
Everything about this spot smells of death though, and the close proximity of
the road to Woodseer doesn't provide much consolation.  Dark green leaves and
stems look even darker here, taking on an almost black cast to them.  The
occasional bright &+Rred&N and &+Yyellow&N flowers add some color to the
forest, but they don't make it feel any safer.  This part of the Rift Valley
Jungle is quite young, something must have cleared the jungle some time ago
because all of the growth here appears to be less than twenty years old.
Despite its youth, the jungle grows quickly, and the dank air here already
smells of the rot and decay that helps sustain the huge trees of older rain
forests.  The jungle continues to the north and east, and there is some sort
of cleared path to the south.

   There is little here that even an adventurer could find attractive.  Swift
growing plants quickly cover all traces of paths and make finding any sort of
real trail difficult.  The stench of the jungle is also a testament to its
fecundity, it takes huges numbers of plants and animals to produce the volume
of waste and decaying matter that lines the jungle floors.  Animals of all
sorts are everywhere.  Rumours of lost cities hidden in the jungle could be
true, it is easy to see that the jungle vegetation could engulf an abandoned
city in only a few years.  Whether any treasure in these cities could be
worth risking the jungle to try to find them is anothe question entirely.

&+GA Young Jungle&N~
   &+WWhite&N, &+Yyellow&N, and &+Rred&N flowers grow so closely intertwined
here that one would think they were planted deliberately, and a well-
concealed building to the east suggests that this might be the case.  The
building itself is fairly plain, it is the thick covering of vines and other
plants that helps conceal the building and make it difficult to detect.
There is no doorway into the building on this side but there is certainly an
exit somewhere.  The jungle continues to the north and south, and there is a
clearing to the west.

   Clearings to the east and west help keep this area much lighter and make
it feel a bit more airy.  The clearing to the east appears to be some sort of
garden, and to the west there is a wide trade path that has been kept clear
of the encroaching jungle.  Though the jungle is a bit lighter here, the
overpowering humidity and stench of rotting vegetation is the same.  The
jungle continues to the north and south and there are clearings to the east
and west.

   One of the huge cliffs that encloses the rift valley runs in a diagonal
along the southeast blocking passage in those directions.  Right now the
jungle appears to be losing its battle against the cliff, and the stones that
have fallen off of it.  Over time that may change, but right now enough rocks
have fallen from above to make it difficult for plants to find good spots for
their roots.  There is a cleared path to the west, and the jungle continues
to the north.

&+GA Wet Jungle&N~
   Water seeps into footprints here as the ground gets soft and marshy.  A
tall fence of thin stakes to the east blocks further progress to the east
where some sort of small village appears to have been built right on a swamp.
The trees here seem to enjoy the water and have grown much taller and
healthier than to the west.  Whatever destroyed much of the jungle in this
area seems to have ended here.  Tremendous trees can be seen growing up out
of the swamp to the east, trees that have put centuries behind them, and look
ready to stand for centuries more.  The jungle continues to the south and
west and a jagged cliff blocks the way north.  Strange frog-like creatures
can be seen through openings in the fence to the east but none of the
openings are large enough to pass through.

   Moisture is everywhere, water drips down the sides of the trees, and seeps
into the tracks that have been left behind by passers-by.  A fence protects
some a small village of frog-like creatures to the east, but none of the
openings are large enough to pass through.  Birds and animals can be heard
calling to each other throughout the jungle, but it is difficult to see them
without looking fairly hard.  The jungle continues to the north, south, and
west, and a fence blocks the way to the east.

   Mosquitoes run rampant here, adding to the discomfort of traveling through
a dark and stinking jungle.  They aren't the only creatures here looking for
a meal either, clearly most of the bards that sing tales of adventure have
never been in such a miserable spot.  The ground is very wet here, but not as
wet as that which can be seen through the fence to the east.  An entire
village of bullywugs has been built in the swampy jungle to the east.
Fortunately, the fence keeps them in as well as travelers here out, they
don't look happy when they notice people on this side of the fence.  Though
there are no real paths here, the jungle continues to the north, south, and
west.

   Though firmer than the marshy ground to the north and east, this ground is
still saturated with water, adding a stagnant aroma to the already awful
stench of rotting vegetation.  Several beautiful &+mpurple&N flowers of some
sort hang from long thin vines, acting as if they trying to touch anything in
reach.  A village of some sort can be seen to the northeast though heavy
vegetation.  The jungle continues in every direction.

   Blood coats everything here, even the roots that surround the burrow are
tinged with the reddish brown color of slowly drying blood.  Water has seeped
in from all sides, but it can't cover the fact that something has died in
here, and very recently.  Several corpses line the bottom of the burrow,
still untouched by maggots or carrion flies.  Whatever killed these creatures
has dissappeared for the moment, or is very well hidden, it might be wise to
leave.  An opening leads back up to the jungle floor.

   Monkeys can be heard screaming from somewhere in the treetops above, and
occasionally a fruit rind drops down to the jungle floor to add to the
already rotting refuse.  It is the continual cycle of life, death, and decay
that keeps the jungle a healthy and powerful testament to the strength of
nature.  Animals can be heard screaming at each other throughout the forest,
some of the cries are obviously of distress.  In the rainforest, only the
strong survive.  The jungle continues in every direction.

   Vines and bushes barely conceal a small building that blocks the way to
the south.  It looks as if someone deliberately encouraged the plants to help
conceal the building.  A number of flowering vines can be seen hanging from
trees to the east, yet there is something sinister about the way they move.
The jungle continues to the north, east, and west but a small building blocks

   This carefully cultivated herb garden lies before the entrance to a small
well-hidden shack to the north.  The well-tended garden has been deliberately
planted so that it would look like just another part of the forest that is
wedged against the cliff face that runs in a diagonal along the south and
east sides of the garden.  A huge variety of jungle plants has been
cultivated here, though what they all are, and which ones are poisonous, is
hard to determine.  The jungle is to the west and an open doorway leads into
a small shack to the north.

devices.  A tiny bed has been crammed into the northwest corner near an
overturned chair and a stack of books.  Clearly, the alchemist that lives
here is dedicated to their work.  An open doorway to the south leads into a
well-cultivated herb garden that must be used to help supply whatever
experiments are carried out here.

even the wooden walls and floor are beginning to decay.  An opening in the

&+GThe Jungle Darkens&N~
   The rumored gloom and darkness of the Rift Valley Jungle is becoming more
clear here.  These trees are much older than those to the west, and bear a
sinister aspect to them that is hard to explain.  A bullywug village can be
seen in the swamp to the north, though the fence that surrounds it blocks
much view.  Humidity and the ever present stench of rotting vegetation add to
the gloom, making this a truely unpleasant place to be.  Halfling scouts will
come out into the jungle this far, to keep watch on the bullywugs, but never
travel any further.  The jungle continues to the south, east, and west, and a
fence blocks the way to the north

   The forest east of this point is dark and foreboding, at least the swamps
to the north show a bit more light through the trees.  South and east of here
there is only dark forest, the gloom seems almost impenetrable, and there is
little to encourage one to take the risks of trying.  Rumours of lost cities
and treasures in the jungle beyond here are easy to believe.  In fact, it
would be easy to pass an entire city by in the darkness of the forest.
Halfling scouts can rarely be seen traveling this far into the forest, but
never into the darkness beyond.  The jungle continues in every direction.

   Branches above still allow a little bit of sunlight in, but further east
there isn't a scrap of sunlight allowed to hit the ground.  Long vines with
&+mpurple&N, &+Rred&N, and &+Yyellow&N flowers hang from the branches above.
Something about the vines, and the flowers, seems ominous but it is hard to
say why.  The jungle continues in every direction, though to the south and
east it is hard to predict what one might run into.  At rare moments the
halfling scouts might come out this far, but certainly no further.

   Jagged rocks line this path as it climbs into the mountains.
Several spots have obviously been cleared of the larger rocks and the
path, though not heavily used has clearly been well cared for.  The
halfling council in Woodseer has decided that it is in their best
interest to keep as many paths to Woodseer open as possible.  This will
help them continue trade and commerce with as many people as possible.
The path continues north into the mountains and down to a clearing
below the Woodseer plateau.

   This small flat area is a convenient resting spot between two very
steep inclines that climb up and down the mountains.  To the south the
path drops off sharply as it slopes down toward the jungle and the path
climbs up a steep grade here as the path makes its way into the
mountains.  Periodically, gentle breezes bring up the steamy air of the
jungle, but generally the slightly cooler air of the mountains has
begun to prevail.  A small stone bench stands here, clearly a resting
place for some of the halfling guards.  The path heads south and up
from here.

   The air here is a particularily stagnent combination of dust and
humidity.  This is a somewhat low area that travels north between some
jagged cliffs or heads down a steep incline.  This path is quite
unforgiving, it is hard to believe that Woodseer would spend the time
and money to patrol it.  Perhaps they feel that there is some possible
trade to be had higher into the mountains.

   Rocky walls extend so high above this point that it is almost more
of a cavern here than an open path.  The path heads south and up here,
as it climbs further into the mountains.  To the south it is clear that
the walls aren't quite as high and that there might even be some
sunlight that reaches all the way down to the path.  Though the path is
wide enough for mules and small trade carts, it is far too steep.  The
work to keep this passage clear must far outweigh any trade benefit.

Here, as well as below, the high rock walls rise sharply upward

some well-shaded spots but no animals or plants can be seen.  The path

   The only sign of life here is several small bushes that line the
edges of the path.  A small clearing to the north would appear to make
an excellent campsite, and this high in the mountains it would appear
to be relatively safe.  Charcoal has been used to write a message on
the walls, a message that reads, &+L"Patrols End Here."&N  This is certainly
meant to inform any travelers that the Woodseer guards will not assist
them beyond this point.
