The Road Leading From Tharnadia~
&+g   This road leads away from &+WTharnadia&+g, toward the lands east.  This section
&+gof earth is lower than the areas flanking the &+WTharnadian&+g countryside, the
&+gresult of an earthquake many centuries ago.  Green grasses flank the road, and
&+ga small forest opens to the south and north.  The road continues west toward
&+gthe city gates, and east toward a stone ramp.

&+yRoad Beneath the Gate Tower&n~

&+wthe city built he made sure it was protected, even though the twin keeps were
&+wbuilt as the last mainstay of defense for the people.  This portion of the
&+wroad is enclosed by a tower which rises overhead.  A long &+Wsteel&+w ladder pokes
&+wout through the ceiling, allowing access to the northern defense tower of the
&+WTharnadian&+w eastern gates.  To the west a small dwelling sags between its
&+wneighbors.  The road continues north, while the city gates lie to the south.&n

&+LTop Level of the &+WLighthouse&n~
&+w   From this height, the view of the &+bTimeless Sea&+w is simply stunning, with
&+wclear views to the north, west and south off onto the horizon line.  The wall
&+wis open on three sides to the sea, supported by thick &+Liron&+w poles that hold up
&+wthe roof.  Perched on a &+Csilver&+w stand at the rooms center, a bright glowing
&+Rvermillion&+w orb gives warning of land to the sailers on the seas.  The sphere
&+wis about a foot around in diameter and radiates an incredibly bright &+rred&+w
&+wlight, so intense that looking at it for more than a second would cause great
&+wpain.  From this height of nearly a hundred feet, ships could easily spot this
&+wbeacon from many miles out, though no power source for the globe can be found.
&+wIt is obvious that the sphere is magical in nature, and seems to be unaffected
&+wby &+Bwater&+w as its surface is damp from ocean mist.  To the northeast you can
&+wsee the great defense walls of &+WTharnadia&+w city, buttressed against the high
&+wstone side of the &+yS&+Yh&+Wr'nn M&+Ye&+Gs&+ga&+w.  A narrow &+Liron&+w balcony is attached to the

&+Bleads down into the lighthouse from here.  The view from here is simply
&+Bbreathtaking, offering a wide open view of the surrounding countryside.  The
&+Bvast &+bTimeless Sea&+B expands westward to the horizon, meeting the &+YSword Coast&n
&+Bwhich runs north and south beyond the range of sight.  The great city of
&+WTharnadia&+B boarders the &+yS&+Yh&+Wr'nn M&+Ye&+Gs&+ga&+B and its unnamed sister, with high stone
&+Bwalls leading eastward like a blunted arrowtip.  Hundreds of building rooftops
&+Bcan be seen overtop the walls, though the crashing of waves below drowns out
&+Bany noises coming from the city.  Up high atop the sister mesas, are the twin
&+Lkeeps&+B of &+bKa&+cyn&+Co&+Wr&+B, wherein lies the governing council of the city and the
&+Bstories of its past.  Majestic &+gforests&+B fill the landscape beyond &+WTharnadia&+B,

&+gThe &+GDruids&+g Grove&n~
&+g   This narrow pathway runs from east to west through a line of huge &+yoak&n
&+gtrees, and appears to be well-kept and well-traveled.  A thick canopy of
&+gdense &+Gvegetation&+g filters out much of the illumination from the heavens.  The
&+Wlight&+g that does make it through comes down in bright beams, forming random
&+gpatterns on the soft &+Lsoil&+g.  The air here, near the forest floor, is cool and
&+gclean-smelling, filled with the aromas of &+Gpine&+g and things growing.  The &+ypath
&+gcontinues west to a clearing, while to the east it comes upon the &+RCarnihern

&+g   This large and &+Lshady &+Gforest&+g clearing looks like the ideal place for rest
&+gand relaxation.  The ground is somewhat uneven, forming small dips and hills
&+gthat are perfect for lying down or studying.  Many small &+cplants&+g and &+Ggrass&+g grow
&+gin abundance here, adding to the already cozy forest atmosphere.  At the
&+gcenter of the clearing sits a small &+Bpond&+g, comfortably nestled in a shallow
&+gdip.  The sounds of many forest &+Lanimals&+g and &+Rbirds&+g can be heard here, as the
&+gforest broadcasts its fullness of life to the world.  The path heads out to

&+gthick underbrush that makes travel extremely difficult to manage.  A small
&+ypath&+g does, however, lead east, between two mammoth &+yoaks&+g.  The forest seems to
&+gthin out a bit further along the path to the west.  Carved into the oak on the

symbol druids~
&+y   The insignia is of a tree stump that morphs into a hand, balled into a fist
&+yaround a &+Wbone&+y, a &+Ltwig&+y, and a &+Rrose&+y.  The symbol is accepted amongst &+WTharnadian&n
&+ydruids as the sign for nuetrality and protection of the wildlife.  The bone
&+yrepresents death and winter, the twig symbolizes transition and autumn, and
&+ythe &+Rrose&+y represents rebirth and the summer months.  You figure the hand-tree
&+yemblem alludes to the &+Wfist of the &+Gforest&+y that so many druids talk about.&n

&+Lstarted, raging through and down to the first floor.  An unstable staircase

&+yand the dangers of the outside world.  The spires of the city can be seen off in
&+ythe distance to the west, while a mighty fortress rises up just to the east of
&+yhere.  All newcomers to the Realms are warned about leaving the protection of the
&+ycity, and should do so only when they feel confident.  A tall sign points in
&+yevery direction here, listing off points of interest and some of the other major

&+yat ten foot intervals, each stone engraven with an image of a creature from
&+ythe &+WTharnadian province&+y.  The area surrounding the path looks unnavigable, as
&+ysharp rocks jut out and loose stones seems to be perched precariously upon the

&+ymade out of solid admantite.  Parapets encircle the keep's walls, large
&+rsc&+Ror&+Ypi&+Won&+y ballista weapons poised ready to be used in defense of the
&+ystronghold.  To the north and south a stone wall angles upward to the full

&+wmakes up most of the keep.  The air up here is cool and slightly faster than

&+ware the whole of &+WTharnadia&+w down to the east.  Overhead a stone bridge spans

&+whaunting shadows that change shape with the movement of the sun.  A granite
&+wstairwell leads down through the north end of the hallway, to the floor below,
&+wits surface smoothed and beveled and a long &+yoaken&+w ballustrade running up its
&+wsouthern side.  The banister is devoid of any carvings, having instead, its
&+wends capped with gold domed ends and &+Ygolden&+w rods supporting it at hand level.
&+wThe stairway leads down to the second floor of &+LCaer Tannad&+w.&n

&+LThe Tower of the &+CCleric~
&+w   An enormous and spectacular looking altar stands at the western end of
&+wthis huge chapel, decorated with some of the most sacred holy symbols on
&+wall of &+RDuris&+w.  Every faith imaginable is represented here, printed on grand
&+wbanners and carved into the marble stone.  A powerful aura of righteousness
&+wpermeates the air here, casting down the blessing of the gods on this holy

&+LThe Tower of the &+GRanger~
   &+gThis tower is a veritable jungle, with huge maples and mighty oaks
&+ggrowing from a layer of soil that covers the floor.  &+GMoss&+g forms a comfortable
&+gcarpeting, perfect for relaxing and enjoying the chamber's air.  The trees
&+gare brimming with wildlife, the sounds of which form a dulcet singsong in the
&+gbackground of your thoughts.  The center of the chamber is clear, the forestal
&+gfauna forming a ring around a small &+Bpond&+g that sparkles with crystal clear
&+gwaters.  Sitting in the middle of this pond is a small statue of a &+Wunicorn&n
&+grearing up on its hind legs, and looking extremely beautiful.  The scent of
&+gpine and earth rise to great your nose.  If you didn't know better you would
&+gthink yourself to be in the middle of a vast forest.  A small staircase enters
&+gthe room through the center of an oak tree to the north.&n

statue unicorn~
   The statue appears to be made from solid marble, and is exquisitely carved.
What is strange is the fact that the statue appears to be standing on top of
the water!  A closer examination reveals this to be true, objects and even
fish can easily pass beneath the statue, and yet it cannot be moved.  Trying
to shift it, one would swear that it was firmly embedded in solid rock.  Even
more curious, is the presence of a magical aura that seems to emanate from the
statue, centered around its horn.  The close you get it, the stronger the
sensation of magic.

&+LA &+RGuest&+L Chamber~
   This chamber is reserved for visiting dignitaries from far off kingdoms.
It is warmly decorated, and comfortable, but one can't help noticing how the
room portrays a sense of wealth and superiority.  This, quite possibly, to
lure the guest into believing that &+WTharnadia&n would want for nothing of them
and any treaties signed would be on common ground.  A large bed filled with
the swan feathers, takes up the most of the room, while various furnitures
serve both elegant and functional purposes.  The hallway lies out to the west.&n

&+w   A &+ysarsen&+w cobblestone floor has been fitted over the keep's granite, here,
&+wbreaking up the monotony of the dark grey stronghold.   The guard's walkway is
&+wflanked by by two low walls, four foot stones spaced out so that an archer can
&+wfire then pull back safely to reload.  From this height, the whole of the

&+wthe great ocean that is the &+BTimeless Sea&+w to the west, and the small rooftops
&+wthat mark the small city of &+WTharnadia&+w down to the east.  The air up here is

&+wbrought up from the harbor to the west.   The walkway continues to the north

&+creagent bottles and spell components lie everywhere.  Several shelves line the
&+cwalls, holding these components and a number of ancient-looking texts.  At the
&+ceastern end of the room sits a large desk made from solid &+Rfire&+c, which seems to
&+cpulse with the images of strange netherworld creatures.  Behind the desk sits
&+ca huge high-backed chair that looks extremely old and very comfortable.  The
&+cmost fascinating feature about this study is the &+Mportal&+c set into the western
&+cwall.  Shaped into a delicate oval, the portal appears to be a gate to another
&+clocation within the keep, as another mage's study can be seen on the other
&+cside.  Energy seems to radiate from the portal, which is obviously used as a
&+cmethod of fast transit and communication.  A granite stairway spirals downward

&+Cwindows&+m here offer a fantastic view of the city down to the east.  Rows of
&+marcane magical texts in &+yoaken&+m bookshelves line every wall in this place of
&+mhigh magic, obviously used by mages studying the art.  There is a huge desk
&+mnear one wall, with a high backed chair behind it.  Illuminated by the glow
&+mof many small orbs, this room radiates magical energy, as if a gate into the
&+mvery skein of magic itself, lay somewhere close by.  Against the east wall
&+mstands another kind of &+Mportal&+m, an ovular gate to place elsewhere in the keep.
&+mIt stands about seven feet high and resembles a mirror in many respects,
&+mexcept for the fact that another mage's study can be seen on the other side.
&+mColors that span the entire spectrum dance all along the edges of the portal.
