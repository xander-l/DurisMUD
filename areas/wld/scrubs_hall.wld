&+LA Deep Cave&N within the &+yCliff's&N &+LFace&n~
&+L    Not apparent to the naked eye, this cave seems to open up into some sort of&N
&+Lcavern.  The smell of the sea is strong and the sounds of waves crashing can&N
&+Lbe heard comming from deep within the cave.  Standing here are four gigantic&N
&+Lstatue like beings.  A chilling feeling overcomes you when they look at you,&N
&+Lthat seem to stare back at you.  A small pathway can be made out heading north&N
&+Lalmost evaluating your soul.  Although this is clearly a very ancient place,&N
&+Lthe path looks fairly well used.  Dry&N &+rblood&+L cover some of the&N &+yrock&+L, and a&N
&+Lsmall etching can be made out on a large&N &+ysand&+Lstone&N &+Lrock.&N

&+LA&N &+YPlank&N &+LLeading to an&N &+LAbandoned&N &+yGalleon&N~
&+L    A huge cavern opens up to the sea here.  Resting upon the water is large&N
&+ygalleon&+L like no other.  Only a few beams of light seem to make it into the&N
&+Lcavern.  A massive &+yslab&+L of &+ywood&+L leads up to the &+yship.&+L  Broken &+Wbottles&+L are&N
&+Lstrewn about the area.  Mixed with the sand and dirt are bones and rotting&N
&+Lcorpses.  A smell of mildew, rotting flesh, and the ocean air make for an&N
&+Lolfactory assault that is beyond description.&N

galleon ship boat~
&+y    This massive ship dwarfs current standards.  Hailing from a time long&N
&+ypassed, this ship could carry an army of hundreds.  Its sails look old and&N
&+yworn, but not too far from sea worthiness.  A forlorn &+cm&+Ce&+Wr&+Cm&+ca&+Lid&+y statue adorns&N
&+ythe head mast.  Ancient &+Lcannons&+y cover the sides of the ship.&N

&+Ldown to the lower decks.&N

&+L   This room is much larger than physically possible.  The tavern is filled&N
&+Lwith tables and to the west is the &+ybar&+L.  Small &+clamps&+L sit on each table making&N
&+Lfor a rather dark ambiance.  The ghost of old Relendian stands behind the bar&N
&+Lprepared to serve your needs.  Women ready to serve needs that Relendian&N
&+Lcannot sit at various tables watching those who enter the bar.  The smell of&N
&+Lmolases is strong in the tavern.  Behind the bar are tons of different kinds&N
&+Lof equipment and other oddities that Relendian has bought from those who have&N
&+Lcome in.  A loyal servant of the &+WS&+cc&+WR&+Cu&+Lb&+WS&+L, Relendian takes care of his people.&N
