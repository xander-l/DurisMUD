&+LA Carved Obsidian Tunnel in the Underdark Wall&n~
&+L   This sheer section of the Underdark cavernous wall appears to have had a master artisan craft a tunnel going to the south. A series of reliefs have been carved around the entrance of the cave, detailing various historical dark elven scholars exploring the vastness of the Underdark.&+n

&+LA Masterfully-Carved Narrow Tunnel&n~
&+L   The tunnel here continues into a clearing to the south, lit by faerie fire and entirely less clausterphobic than this tunnel seems. Nonetheless, the floors have mosaics of tile that are polished to give even the softest of step a gentle echoing footstep in this cavern.&n

&+L   The stairs appear to be masterfully carved into the obsidian Underdark rock, as if they had always meant to be here. They have been worn slightly over the years from students and scholars alike to progress within this great depository of knowledge within the Underdark's rather bleak inhabitants. The stairs are long, narrow of height, perhaps meant for those having strolling discussions as they walked.&N

&+L   At the top of the great stairs is a portico of sorts, or a covered column-filled area inside of a larger cavern. The Columns appear to be elegant nymphs of some form, perhaps twisted from an unnatural experience on the Negative Material Plane, twisted into a dance about black smoke-like cores of the columns. To the east, a large set of double-doors has been carefully set into a series of reliefs carved into the cavern's sheer wall.&N

There are small tables and benches along the sides of the walls, perhaps to allow visitors to view whatever occurs within this room.&N

&+L   This room is an over-stuffed library of many tomes, however, many of them remain untouched and covered in dust. Instead, the room has been further cramped with the inclusion of a dozen chairs, meant to occupy those who would come hear the greatest bards of the lands sing and tell tales, rather than have to read about them.&N
