&+yThe Base of a Mountain&n~
&+y   Here lay the foothills of a large mountain range, the base itself
&+yis quite flat compared to the surrounding area, and gazing upwards,
&+yappears to be the flattest area for miles around.  It is strangely
&+yquiet here, and even the wind itself seems to calm and gentle. Looking
&+yto the northeast, a faint trail can be seen rising up the side of the
&+ymountains. A &+Wsign&+y has been planted into the hard, rocky soil here.&n

&+yThe Start of a Mountain Trail&n~
&+y  The base of mountain leads westwards, and a trail that must certainly
&+ylead up to the summit leads up. With just a glance one can tell it will
&+ybe a long and difficult climb. One can see the trail itself twisting and
&+yturning around the mountain in the distance. A hooded merchant stands
&+yhere, either unwilling or unable to make the climb to the top to sell
&+yhis wares, or prefering business down here at the base, where travellers
&+yare more likely to venture.&n

&+yApproaching the Summit&n~
&+y   The air begins to get noticiably thinner at this hieght, as the
&+ytrail twists and turns leading ever closer to the summit that lies in
&+yplain view now, not far off.  The screach of mountain birds echoes in
&+yones ears, and now another, louder sound can also be heard coming from
&+ythe peak, that sounds strangely like a proper language.&n

&+yThe Mountain Summit&n~
&+y   The summit of the mountain is the home to a large harpy settlement,
&+ywhere all sorts and of all alignments of these intelligent, but savage,
&+ybird people come to sleep, hunt, and raise their families.  The air is
&+yfilled with the shrill shrieks of their native language, which is near-
&+yimpossible to decipher.  The trail through the summit itself is quite
&+yrocky, as the harpies have little need for it, yet is still traversable
&+yby guests if need be. Nests can be seen positioned on nearly ever
&+ypeak around the area.&n

&+yrugs and carpets, and skins from several unique animals.  Piles of coins
&+ylay behind her, well protected by her and her guards, and trinkets of

&+yit is as a sort of symbolic show, as this location is the highest point

&+yA &+YCommunal&+y Nest&n~
&+y   Second only to the Queen's Nest in size, this huge communal nest is
&+ynearly the busiest area of the entire settlement.  Several different
&+yfamilies of Harpies gather here to sleep each and everynight, and though
&+yit would seem disorganized to the untrained eye, the community does have
&+ya strict sense of disipline about it.  Nests of all shapes and sizes make
&+yup most of this area and the cool mountain air is quite refreshing. Harpies
&+yfrom other flocks often use this communal nest as their sleeping quarters.
&+yA large&+W sign&+y has been planted here for the benefit of new harpies.&n

&+yA Dangerous Precipice&n~
&+y   This is nothing more than a jagged ledge that overlooks several
&+yvalleys far below.  The ledge has barely enough room for a couple people
&+yon it, and seems very unstable.  Even more unnerving is the cliff itself
&+ywhich overhangs a portion of the mountain in such a way that if one
&+ywas to take a single wrong step, one would be in for a very long and
&+yvery painful fall.  Strangely enough, a large&+L Mino&+rtaur &+ystands blocking
&+ythe dangerous portion of the ledge, casually counting out piles of
&+ycoins as if he was back in the forests below, in a comfortable shop.&n

&+yA Mountain &+BSpring&n~
&+B   Either from rain, snowmelt, or runoff from higher up in the
&+Bmountains, this pool is quite a treat for the local residents of the
&+Barea, including the Harpies in the area, as it provides their main
&+Bsource of water.  This pool drains downwards towards the field in
&+Ba series of small waterfalls as it flows over the mountain rocks.&n

&+Bwater.  The watering hole is a boon for the creatures of the valley,  as
&+Bwater itself is quite rare to find up in the mountains here.  Unlike the
&+Bspring in the fields above though, this pool is quite more secluded and
&+Bprivate, usually used only by the residents of the valley here, or the
&+Boccasional roc or harpy or wyvern that spies it while flying overhead.&n

&+ybranches that make up the nest one can tell it must be at least half a

&+LA Subterrean Den&n~
&+L   Unde&+wrneath a pile of rubble and earth from the field above lies
&+Lthis strange &+wlair.  The mountains are well known for their share of
&+Lcaves and crevice&+ws, though this one appears much larger than the others.
&+LIt twists and turns b&+weneath the surface, filled with strange insects
&+Lthat click and clatter in&+wcestentily. Though the sound is drowned up
&+Labove, here it is almost defe&+waning.&n

&+LA Crab Spider Lair&n~
&+L   This room stinks horribly and is littered with carcasses from
&+Ljust about every animal that lives in the mountain.  Bones, too, lie
&+Lscattered about, showing off the pure viciousness of these little
&+Lspiders.  With a stunned look, one can actually see the remains of
&+Lharpy corpses under the piles of filth, proving that despite the size
&+Lthese crab spiders are certainly dangerous for anyone unwary.&n

&+yAtop a Mountain Peak&n~
&+y   Here, one finds himself high atop on of the highest peaks in the
&+yregion.  The air, incredibly thin, also now has a freezing chill to it
&+ythat could only be felt at such an elevation. Frost-biting winds whip
&+yabout to chill the skin equal only to the powers of the harpy &+wether-
&+wmancers&+y.  At this height one can gaze below to see nearly the entire
&+ysettlement as well as much of the surrounding region.&n
