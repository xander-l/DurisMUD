Underneath a Stone Bridge~
   The dark waters of the winding river make their way underneath an arched
stone bridge here, perhaps ten feet wide.  The rivers waters are dark and
mysterious, though appear to be reasonably clean.  Hundreds of thick cobwebs
line the stone of the bridge, some hanging down several feet, making one a
bit reluctant to meet the spider that made them.  The river runs east to west
from here, while the bridge above is covered with slippery moss.

Edge of the Troll Hills~
   The land surrounding this ancient road is dark gray, covered with stubby
grass and weeds.  It is still hilly here, though much less so than the plains
north of here, and continues to flatten out further to the south.  The road
itself becomes less defined here, partially covered with the darker soil, and
from the fact that many of the bricks making it up are missing.

Road through the Troll Hills~
   This narrow, ten foot wide road runs north to south here, strait through
the dark landscape covered with tall weeds and mossy grass.  The terrain is
more or less flat here, covered with a dense fog that inhibits vision to about
fifty feet.  Strange and freighting noises can be heard in the distance, though
their exact location cannot be ascertained through the fog.  There is something
definitely uncomfortable about this place.

Road Through the Troll Hills~
   This narrow, brick roadway is the only guide leading across this dark and
foreboding landscape, surrounded on both sides by tall weeds and mossy grass.
An occasional tree can be seen, with leaveless branches indicating it has long
since died away.  The fog here is thick and humid, blanketing the land and
obscuring vision beyond fifty feet.  Mysterious and horrifying shrieks echo
through the fog in the distance, probably made by monsters that most would
avoid at any cost.  The road continues north to south, while the hills expand

Road Across the Troll Hills~
   The terrain surrounding this ancient road is very wet and slimy,
looking alot like a bog or marsh, though solid enough to walk across.
The road itself is composed of mostly of wooden beams, each about eight
feet long and 6 inches wide, stacked next to each other.  A heavy fog
covers the land here, making it impossible to see further away than
fifty feet or so, giving this area a very unsettling feel.  Strange
and unfamiliar sounds can be heard in the distance, though who or what
is making them is not clear.  The road continues north to south here.

Stone Bridge over a Still River~
   This ten foot wide stone bridge is completely covered with slippery
green moss, having no side rails for support, and making a low arch
over the still waters below.  The river looks quite shallow, perhaps
five feet in depth, and either moving very slowly or not at all.  The
bridge looks is ancient and crudely made, as if whomever built it was in
a hurry, and not out to make a piece of art.  The road continues north

The Troll Hills~
   Tall weeds and thick bushes cover this dark and broken landscape,
whose ground is muddy and soft.  A dense fog covers the area, blanketing
everything in a gray mist that inhibits vision and makes the air seem
wet and uncomfortable.  Many unpleasant odors fill the air, with a stale
and rotten smell.  The trees that can be seen around here in the mist
are all long dead, looking like skeletal remains sprouting up out of the
earth.  All in all, this place is quite dreadful to be in, made even more
unsettling as strange shrieks and sounds drifting along through the fog.
The hills continue in all directions, looking much more swamp-like to the
west and south.

   The ground here is wet and marshy,  with two foot deep pools spaced
out every five feet or so, making travel very difficult and strenuous.
Tall weeds sprout up everywhere here, some reaching heights of three feet,
accompanied by thick marsh grass and small bushes.  A dense fog covers
the terrain, so thick that vision is limited to a five or six foot range
in any direction, making the air wet and unpleasantly cold.  Off in the
mists,  the shrill sounds of shrieks and groans can be heard, though their
distance and direction cannot be ascertained.  An evil permeates the entire

strike fear into the hearts of any mortal man.  The hills continue to the

   This shallow river is only about five feet deep and ten feet wide,
filled with dark, murky water.  The river does not seem to flow at all,
and must be moving very very slowly.  A layer of algae has consumed most

feels very muddy and gross, just the kind of river one would expect to
find in this vile place.  The river continues east while running under

The Marshy Troll Hills~
   The ground here is wet and marshy,  with two foot deep pools spaced
out every five feet or so, making travel very difficult and strenuous.
Tall weeds sprout up everywhere here, some reaching heights of three feet,
accompanied by thick marsh grass and small bushes.  A dense fog covers
the terrain, so thick that vision is limited to a five or six foot range
in any direction, making the air wet and unpleasantly cold.  Off in the

Outside a Huge Mound~
   A humongous twenty foot mound of mud and clay rises up out of the swamp
here, at least ten feet around at the base.  The construct is obviously
artificial, with thousands of twigs and sticks sticking out of its frame.
It appears that this mound is a dwelling of some kind, though why someone
would build it here is beyond belief.  The black mud of the swamp forms
around the mound, making a tight packing.  A rather large stone door has
been set into the front of the mound here, barely visible through the dense
fog.

Inside a Huge Stone Mound~
   The inside of this mound is well constructed, with thick wooden branches
and bent tree limbs forming a strong framework.  The air here smells awful,
with a combination of body dour, feces, and an overall mustiness polluting
the atmosphere.  From inside here, the mounds actual purpose becomes known;
It is merely a casing for a tunnel that descends downwards into darkness,
accessible by a crude wooden ladder.  The stone door in the south wall here
looks quite sturdy, hinged to the wooden beams with iron ties.

Inside an Underground Dwelling~
   The vertical tunnel ends here in an ovular shaped chamber, with the
ladder attached to its western end.  The walls are made from thick black
clay and mud, all wet with condensation from the swamp above.  The tunnel
leads about thirty feet upwards to a huge mound at ground level.  To the
east, the chamber opens into a larger area of the dwelling, where furniture
and other items one would find in a home are visible.  Something about the
place doesn't seem right however, call it an aura or just a feeling, but
the sensation of being watched by a powerful evil is strong here.

soft moss and comfy cushions, indicating that the occupant is a large

furnishings, though the desk is large enough to seat a giant.  It is made
from black wood, with two demon's head carvings at either edge.  The aura

adding a very eerie feeling to the area.  The shrill cries and moans from

The Dark Marshes~
   The ground here is very soft and wet, producing squashing sounds whenever
stepped upon.  Huge weed-like plants and swamp grass sprout up everywhere,
accompanied by small pools of water and mud every few feet, making travel
extremely difficult.  A thick fog covers the marsh here, impairing vision and
adding a very eerie feeling to the area.  The shrill cries and moans from

Next to a Huge, Dead tree~
   The standing remnants of an ancient tree sprout out of the marsh
here, at least ten feet around at the base and rising up fifty or so
feet into the air.  Hundreds of gouge marks scar the dead tree, many
of which look like long raking claws digs.  The tree has probably been
dead a very long time, and now resembles a huge standing skeleton, a
memory of the life that once thrived here.  The incredibly dense fog
inhibits vision in any direction, and the shrieks of monsters best left
to the fog echo on the mists.

Huge Pile of Dead Wood~
   A massive pile of dead tree trunks and broken branches is here, blocking
access to the river east of here.  The pile is about fifteen feet high,
composed of at least fifty dead tree's.  It looks as though someone or
something piled the wood like this for a reason, though the purpose for
doing remain unclear.  The fog obscures vision and makes a close, detailed
analysis impossible.  A horribly unpleasant smell emanates from somewhere
closeby.

Bend in the Winding River~
   This shallow river is only about five feet deep and ten feet wide,
filled with dark, murky water.  The river does not seem to flow at all,
and must be moving very very slowly.  A layer of algae has consumed most

feels very muddy and gross, just the kind of river one would expect to

appears to be constructed out of rocks and logs, probably responsible
for much of this areas flooding.  The waters in this river are dark and
murky, definitely not drinkable.  Algae as grown over much of the river
at the base of the dam, along with marsh grass and weeds.  The river

   A fairly sizable tree has fallen over the river here, and is now firmly
embedded into the mud on the other side.  It appears that this tree has
been here for quite some time, probably having fallen long ago when the
marshes overtook this land.  A few of the tree's branches still dangle
down into the murky waters, around which tiny lines form, indicating that
the river is indeed flowing.  The banks are accessible on both sides here,

The Dark Marshes~
   The ground here is very soft and wet, producing squashing sounds whenever
stepped upon.  Huge weed-like plants and swamp grass sprout up everywhere,
accompanied by small pools of water and mud every few feet, making travel
extremely difficult.  A thick fog covers the marsh here, impairing vision and
adding a very eerie feeling to the area.  The shrill cries and moans from
unseen animals or monsters echo through the fog, though it is not possible
to tell where they are coming from.  Taken as a whole, the marsh is terrifying,
enough so to strike fear into all but the bravest of men.

The Fields of the Dead~
   This large muddy expanse of ground is littered with bones, corpses,
dead trees, and large stones, giving it a very horrifying appearance.
Literally hundreds of humanoid tracks can be seen imprinted in the mud,
indicating that this area is frequented regularly.  A thick obscuring
fog blankets the field, hiding whatever horrors may be lurking about in
the shadows, though many shrieks and groans can be heard.  It is obvious
from the absolute carnage presented here, that many an unfortunate animal

Before a Huge Stone Monolyth~
   A massive block of smooth stone stands here, amidst the skeletal
remains of a hundred humanoids.  The stone block is fifteen feet high,
nine feet wide, and one foot in thickness.  The monolith is covered
with hundreds of tiny runes and symbols, many of which glow rather
brightly.  A more thorough inspection is difficult without getting
close to it, as a thick fog covers the field.  Interestingly, not many
humanoid tracks lead up to or around the stone block, as they seem to
avoid it for some reason.  What is holding the stone up is not clear,
though it must be getting support from somewhere.  An aura of mystical
energy surrounds the area here.

stone block monolyth~
The monolith is perfectly smooth, without even a single blemish on its
smooth surface.  The runes each glow an individual color, covering
almost the entire spectrum.  Upon closer inspection, the runes look
very much like an ancient form of a long lost language, obviously enchanted
with powerful magic.  The aura of power that surrounds the block is quite
penetrating, shifting and effecting the magical energies of the area.

The only inscription on the monolith that you can read is:

                    Seek an old man..

Large Sinkhole on the Fields of Death~
   The ground beneath this area of the field appears to have given
way at some point in time, collapsing inward to form a five foot deep
sinkhole.  A small pool of water, perhaps a foot deep, now fills sits
at the bottom along with a pile of bones and remains.  The muddy walls
of the hole make climbing in or out very difficult here, but not
impossible.  The fog covering this plain seems very thick in here,
so much so that one might be tempted to slice it with a knife.

On the Stump of a Mammoth Tree~
   The remains of what must have been an enormous tree are here, looking
as though it was hacked down a very long time ago.  The stump rises up
about three feet from ground level, and is almost ten feet around in size,
forming a crude platform here.  The stump is blackened and slimy now,
covered with feces and animal droppings that putrefy the air with an awful
stench.  The fog covering this plain is too thick to allow any distance
vision, even from this low perch.

Huge Pool in the Fields of Death~
   This eight foot deep pool is filled with slimy, murky water from
which an unpleasant oder wafts off.  The pool is about ten feet around
in diameter, and appears to have been caused by the opening of a large
sinkhole that filled itself with water.  The fog that covers the area
is very thick, almost completely obscuring vision.
