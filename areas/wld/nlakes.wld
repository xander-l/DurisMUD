of cold water and others of small ice islands.  The ice islands
bob up and down in the water at varying speeds.  Small aquatic
animals can be seen swiming around underwater and come up for air
and the occasional look around.  The skies here are overcast and
it is very cold. Just beyond the northern shores of this lake,
there is a large forest that covers the area as a whole.  There
