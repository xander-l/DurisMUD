   The tunnel continues west, but the way is blocked by unmovable
rubble.  A small hole the upper corner of the rubble looks like it is
frequently used for passage; either by very large rats or perhaps
something more vicious..  This is the source of the noises, squealing
that almost sounds like laughter.

&+yA Wide Ridge Along the North Cavern Wall&N~
   This ridge runs east and west here along the north wall of Faang Cavern. The
ridge is slick with bat guano, as large clumps of bats hang from the ceiling
directly overhead. The bats squeaks are almost deafening. To the south, a vast
chasm can be seen forming a huge, black L shape in the cavern floor. The ridge
continues east and west.

&+yA Wide Ridge Along the North Cavern Wall~
   This is the western end of a wide ridge bisecting the northern wall of Faang
Cavern. The ridge is about 5 feet wide, narrowing to 3 feet in places. Bat
guano coats the ridge, making it very slippery. Bats hang from the cavern
ceiling in groups directly above the ridge. The ridge continues to the east. A

   The tribal champions earn the right to have a semi private cave in the
cavern. The slit from the ridge opens up into a fairly large cave. This cave is
almost square in shape, unusual for a natural cave. Small rock points protrude
from the ceiling making it a bit hazardous to walk without bending over. Small
gaps and cracks cover the floor, none wide enough to cause any problems. The
cave continues north and south.

&+yBank of a Small River&n~
   The bank is made of jagged rock, at times razor sharp.  The river
has made it this way through years of wear and tear.  The path widens
and rises to the south as it becomes the bank of Ogre Lake.  A guard
post is visible, keeping out undesirables.

&+BA Lakeside Guard Post&n~
   A crude guard post has been erected here to watch the traffic in
and out of Faang.  The river meets the &+BOgre Lake &nto the east, marking
the real boundary of this ogre haven.  Large boulders lie blocking
the west side of the river bank so the city can not be stormed by
invaders.  The watch is continuous; even ogres are not stupid enough
to be caught by surprise by overly ambitious &+Mdrow.  &nThe lake to the
south extends almost all the way to the south wall of the limestone
dome Faang was built around.  The outline of two huge stalactites
hanging ominously over the lake can barely be seen, giving the
&+LUnderdark &nstronghold its name.  The bank along the lake begins
to the west, gaining in height and width.&n

   This bar is definately festive, with much of the crowd being from
out of town.  Most of them are either mercenaries or merchants.  The
bar is in a large limestone cave situated above the row of eastern
cave homes.  The bar counter is a block of granite, not without its
nicks and indents made by foreheads and clubs.  Several small tables
are scattered about for private discussions.  A putrid odor comes from
the west where those who can't handle the Wicked Ale hurl.  A
straw-filled room is available to the east for weary travellers, but
Wurtrka has been known to get a little nasty in there after hours..
A steep stairway out the cave opening leads to the trail through the

&+yAn Unfinished Tunnel&n~
   This tunnel was an unsuccessful attempt at escpae by some
industrious duergar, most likely trying to tunnel out to Ogre Lake.
Many partial corpses and bones lie here belonging to those who tried
to continue the effort.

&+yA Short Trail&n~
   This short trail connects the South Road with the arena and slave
auction block.  The smell of rotting &+Rflesh &nrides the cavern air
currents.  Buckets of slave &+yguano &nhave been dumped on either side
of the trail.  The Mid Faang Road is beyond a waist high wall far to

&+LThe Slave Auction Block&n~
   The slave block is a long stone slab which the slaves legs are
tied to until they are bought.  Slaves who aren't purchased are
promptly brought to the &+Gmerrow&n, the ogres' lake cousins; without
such appeasement Faang citizens often start to disappear.  Slave
trading is a vital part of the economy, and taken very seriously.
Large races are usually bought for arena contests while smaller
races go into service.  A large lies to the east.

wagered on the slave fights.  The floor is rarely scrubbed, and a
dried up &+rblood &ntrail goes all the way east to the Faang wall.

&+LA Large Cave&n~
   This cave is where slaves about to be auctioned are weighed,
examined, and guarded.  A large simple scale is in the center of the
room; it consists of a teeter-totter with a big rock tied to one
side and the slave on the other.  If the slaves raises the rock he
or she is considered large and sells for more.  Borderline slaves
are fattened up before the weigh in.  Loud yelling from the auction
in a rocky clearing to the west makes for a bad head ache.

   This plateau stretches from Faang City to Death Valley.  The view
is pretty good, almost all sides of the cavern visible.  Off the
plateaus several races fight for the wild Underdark space; their
tents and hovels dot the desolate landscape.  Sub rocs can be seen
circling high above.  The hunting is fairly good here with wargs
and white hyena plentiful.

&+LAn Ogre Dwelling&n~
   This cave is large enough for a single ogre family.  Five animal
hide beds are spread about, and a crude notch is cut in the floor for
waste to drain outside.  A small path comes up to the cave opening
from the main tunnel.  Small critters dart about the house just
waiting to be eaten.

&+LA Cramped Cave&n~
   &+BToys &nand more &+Rmutilated &nrodents lie about.  This is a fun place
to play, removed from the hectic Faang Cavern.  There isn't enough
room for anything too large to move freely here.  A &+Rdangerous &nlooking
jagged slope lies to the west, beckoning to ogre youths to come test
their dexterity.   A tiny tunnel winds its way up to the cave above.

&+LA Steep Jagged Slope&n~
   &+LThis slope is almost unescapeable &+Rdoom.  &+LThe low ceiling
&+Lis tempting to grab onto but the razor sharp rock only slices at the
&+Lhands cruelly.  A mixture of &+rblood &+Lfrom many victims caked onto the
&+Lslope distracts the climber from the crucial task of finding a hand
&+Lhold.  The cramped cave to the east seems to laugh mercilessly.

&+LA Deep Chasm in the Rock&n~
   &+LThe cramped cave lies high above, with the chasm and slope
&+Lbefore it.  There are very few hand holds to climb back up, and
&+Lfresh &+rblood &+Lmakes the walls slick.  There is nowhere to walk
&+Lon the narrow floor, its covered with partial corpses and bones.
&+LLooking at the faces creates unimaginable terror but also awakens
&+Lthe adreneline pumping &+rBloodlust&n.

&+bOn a Small River&n~
   &+BThe river is fed by the hot springs, making it too warm for most
&+Blife.  A sharp cliff rises up to the west.  The loud sounds of water
&+Bviolently crashing comes from the north.  There is a strong current
&+Bheaded into Ogre Lake.  The river teams with fish that have adapted
&+Bto the subterranean.&n

   The under ground river plunges over a vertical drop to the north. The roar
of the water hitting below is almost deafening. Mist rises up from below and
