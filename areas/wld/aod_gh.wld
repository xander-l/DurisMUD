&+WA Desecrated Mausoleum over-grown with &+Gf&+gu&+Gn&+gg&+Gu&+gs&n~
&+WThis mausoleum has been ravaged by time and looters, large &+wcracks run along
&+Wthe walls. The smell of death is prevalent and strange s&+ww&+Wi&+wr&+Wl&ni&+wn&+Wg&n &+wm&+Wi&+ws&+Wt&n hugs the
&+Wground.&+g Troll&n and&+b Ogre&+W symbols are scrawled across the once finely detailed
&+Wrelief sculptures that were intended to glorify a holy warrior.
&+WThe sculptures of saints and good aligned gods have been &+Lde&+wfi&+Ll&+we&+Ld&n and the
&+Wremains of their decapitated heads lie&+w crumbling&+W upon the floor.
&+WIt is &+rstained&n &+Wfrom top to bottom with &+rsplattered&+r blood&n &+W and the stone is
&+Wscarred and pitted with both old and new sings of battle. A &+Lrav&+win&+Lg&+W evil can
&+Wbe sensed, and it fights to take over your soul.

&+LThe Chamber of &+wBones.~
&+LA grim sight and even more gruesome smell lingers in this chamber numbing
&+Lyour sense. Scattered all over the floor and hung from the ceiling are
&+Ltrophies of war taken from those foolish enough to cross paths with
&+Lthe &+L-* T&+bo&+Lr&+bm&+Le&+bn&+Lt&+be&+Ld S&+bo&+Lu&+bl&+Ls *-. Crumbled corpses of &+Chumans&+L lies tossed in the
&+Lroom along with those of&+R gnomes&+L,&+c grey elves&+L and other lesser creatures that
&+Lpolute this existence.&+y Flayed skin&+L adorn the walls and &+wbleached bones&+L litter
&+Lthe &+Rb&+ru&+Rr&+rn&+Ri&+rn&+Rg&+L oil suspended in mid-ar by sime unknown force. The flickering of
&+Lthe &+Rf&+Rl&+ra&+Rm&+re&+Rs&+L causes a frightening effect as the shadows of&+w grinning skulls&+L play
&+Lalong the barren walls.

&+LThe Inner Sanctum.~
&+LThe Inner Sanctum has been converted from a final resting place into a
&+Lmeeting room. A Large sarcophagus now serves as a table. It's missing chunks
&+Lof stone, Probally due to the political arguments between the less
&+L"open-minded" races. Large maps and battle strategies written in&+G Goblin&n &+L and
&+mDrow&+L script are hung on the walls for debate and discussion.
&+wThe skeleton of a Tharnadian Paladin&+L is slumped in the corner, still wearing
&+Larmor, but its helmet has been replaced with a&n &+Gy&+Ye&+Gs&+Yt&+Ge&+Yr&+Gs&n &+Yc&+Ga&+Yp&+L. Towards the back
&+Lof the room rests a tremendous onyx basin used for unholy rites and rituals

&+LThe supply depot of the &+L-* T&+bo&+Lr&+bm&+Le&+bn&+Lt&+be&+Ld S&+bo&+Lu&+bl&+Ls *-~
&+yThe supply depot is in total disarray, its construction is still not
&+ycomplete. The room itself seems to have been simply carved out of the earth,
&+yand was clearly not an original part of this grave sight. Shattered crates
&+yare strewn about and shelves barely still hanging on the walls are scattered
&+yall over the room. Broken pieces of once usefull items lies abandoned on the
&+yfloor. Chocking dust and refuse have built up over the years making breathing
&+ydifficult. Here and there a barrel or crate seems to be in good condition,
&+ymarking it as new.&+L A Deformed Old &+RVampire&+L with one arm&+y awaits your order
&+yoblivious the mess.

&+WThe Burial Tomb.~
&+wWhat appears to have been a burial tomb constructed of fine marble has now
&+wbeen put to practical use. Several sarcophaguses, once the resting place
&+wfor many noble knights, now serve as storage chests filled to the bring with
&+wloot from succesfull raids. There is something interesting to be found here
&+wfor most everyone. When poking around one shouldn't be surprised when finding
&+wa &+yrotting hand&+w stuck in an old gauntlet or an occasional foot left in a pair
&+wof boots. Some of the more brutish and less intelligent races simply forget
&+wto get ridof the former owner before putting items into the chest.

&+LYou try not to cry out in agony as you ventyre deeper into the Void

&+LThe &+rHeart&+L of the Onda~
&+LAs you step through the oorway you feel as if you might as well have stepped
&+Linto the abyss. There is no sense of up or down or anything to limit the
&+Lchamber as darkness stretches out ever expanding. The sensation of falling
&+Linto ob&+wli&+Wv&+wio&+Ln is overwhelming and you struggle not to scream. Deeper into
&+Lvoid, covering the floor is the symbol of &+L-* T&+bo&+Lr&+bm&+Le&+bn&+Lt&+be&+Ld S&+bo&+Lu&+bl&+Ls *-, the Onda.
&+LEtched into the darkness is a&+r deep-red&+L serpent drawn in blood. Biting its own
&+Ltail it forms a perfect circle. It's a circle that can not be broken, the
&+Lcircle of dominence. The power of La Onda sweeps over you, its meaning
&+Lrevealed. It's a wave that overcomes you, a destiny that will not be denied.
&+LA destiny to rule...

have created an elite, and inner circle clan efficient in dealing

leave Duris for a time from this room. Even the strong sometime
succumb to the forces that aren't within their control.

   Greeings mortals. Dread not the many worries of the underdark, do
not fret that spanky equipment you've just lost, and think not of
the many injustices thrown upon you and your kin. You are the elite,
the usurpers of the underworld. There are no challenges that you can
not accomplish, no battle that you can not win. Only the strong
dwell within these walls, only the competent are allowed within your
ranks. From the first of days till the end of days, you the strong
live in the hell that is the &+LUD&n.
