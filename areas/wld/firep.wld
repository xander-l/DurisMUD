&+LPlatform Before a &+RMolten &+rRock &+RLake&n~
&+L   A flat expanse of hardened magma makes up a small ledge here against
&+Lan unscalable wall of towering obsidian which blocks travel to the north
&+Land west.  To the southeast, a gigantic lake of magma stretches off into
&+Lthe distance.  Large gouts of flame &+Rand lava &+Lshoot high into the air
&+Labove the lake, causing &+Rmolten rock and ash to rain &+Ldown from above.
&+LThe temperature &+Rhere is sweltering to say the &+Lleast, as waves of heat
&+Ldistort the &+Rair above the lake, and combine with &+Lthe other factors to
&+Lobscure vision &+Rto the horizon.  Small islands of hardened magma &+Lfloat
&+Lacross &+Rthe lake, crashing into each other randomly as they &+Ltravel the

&+rLarge volcanic islands float amongst the cooler magma drifting along the
&+rcurrents and moving towards the lake beyond.  Vortexes of hotter, swirling

&+LAn Enormous Mountain of Ash and Pulverized Volcanic Rock~
   &+LA cinder cone of ash and pulverized volcanic rock has formed here over the
&+Lendless time since the &+rElemental Plane of Fire&+L was first created.  The great
&+Lsize of the conic mountain is apparent from the sheer distance the slopes take
&+Lto get to the top.  Running at low angle of about thirty degrees, the slopes
&+Lrise extremely slowly to the peak of the cone several miles high at it's peak.
&+LUpon the vast slopes, creatures of fire toil tirelessly, adding more of the
&+Lvolcanic remains of the plane to the mountain.&n

&+LUpon the &+wAshen Slopes &+Lof a Great &+rVolcanic &+LMountain~
   &+LThe dark meandering slopes of the mountain spread out like a smoothed skirt
&+Lto form a massive base for the cinder cone.  Large fissures break up the
&+Lotherwise groomed surface of the slopes in several places.  Many glowing shapes
&+Lmove about the slopes, moving over the top of the ashen surface easily.  Many
&+Lof these disappear within the fissures for several moments before exiting and
&+Lcontinuing on their way.  A rather tangible orange haze obscures the upper
&+Lportion of the mountain.  The shifting and billowing cloudiness threatens to
&+Lcareen down the side of the mountain at any time, but for now it merely awaits
&+La better time.&n

&+rA Floating &+LChunk &+rof &+CMetallic Debris&n~
&+r   This &+Cfloating chunk&+r of debris drifts along the currents of
&+rliquid magma that make up this portion of the cinder cone.  Various chunks
&+rof different &+Cmetals &+rhave formed an amalgam that neither melts nor
&+rdeforms in the overwhelming heat.  A very low humming sound can be heard
&+rcoming from the very surface of the &+Cmetallic island&N &+ras it slowly
&+rdrifts along.  The chunk is fairly considerable in size, spanning at least
&+rfourty feet in all directions from its center.  What types of metal or
&+rhow they came to be here are, at best, a mystery.&n

&+LAn Obsidian Bridge Over a &+RFiery &+LChasm&N~
&+R   Fathoms above the surface of the bubbling and chrning magma below, this
&+Rbridge extends from the edge of the cinder cone's top, out towards the &+LCharcoal
&+LPalace&+R. The palace itself seems to float within the air, tethered to the ashen
&+Rmountains by only the bridge. Towering spires writhe and weave in the likeness
&+Rof flames reaching towards the fiery sky above. Spiked protrusions extend
&+Routwards from random locations all around the palace walls. Wisps of thick
&+Rsmoke seem to ooze slowly out of the structure, coalescing in great swaths
&+Rabove the highest reaches of the palace. The bridge leads eastwards towards
&+Rthe field of the ashen slopes.&n

&+yBridge of &+rFire~
&+y  A whisper-thin bridge of onyx, obsidian, basalt and hardened ash traverses
&+ythe vast depths that lie between the edge of the cone and the center, where
&+ythe Charcoal Palace hangs suspended just above a pillar of molten lava.  The
&+Lspiraling &+yand writhing formations of stone spin about each &+Lother and form
&+Lwicked spikes and spines.  These protrusions make the already foreboding
&+Lscene even &+ymore dire.  Somewhere, the tumultuous forces that &+Lbind the plane
&+ytogether are straining against each other, making the already unstable
&+yground even more so.  The groaning of rock against rock echoes across the
&+yentire cone, reverberating loudly against everything solid.&n

&+LGates of the Charcoal Palace~
&+L   Twin gates of some alchemical amalgam stand before the entrance to the
&+LCharcoal Palace here. The gates span a massive distance for any mortal creature
&+Land as such, the metallic-rock gates must be made of an impressively strong
&+Lsubstance. The gatehouse leading into the palace lies just beyond the gates,
&+Land appears to be heavily guarded. Wisps of smoke waft through the gates
&+Lregularly, floating outwards and partially obscuring the upper reaches of the
&+Lgatehouse parapets. There are several blackened corpses of large beasts hanging
&+Lominously from metal spikes drilled into the archway over the gates. A strange
&+Lsilence seems to permeate the area, almost as a calm before a storm.&n

&+LEntryway to the Charcoal Palace&n~
&+L   This is the massive entryway to the palace proper which is bordered on
&+Leach side by a guard post.  A portcullis crafted from obsidian lies upon either
&+Lside of the chamber, ready to be placed into action should the need arise.  An
&+Lambient light drifts into the area through the cracks in the dark stone floor,
&+Lwhere it appears that the volcanic action beneath the palace proper is actually
&+Lproviding the light.  The area is swelteringly hot as one would expect from
&+Lthis hellish place.  The palace gates lie just to the east, while the rest of
&+Lthe abode of &+rKossuth&+L lies to the west.&n

&+LHallway in the Charcoal Palace~
&+L   This decadent hallway is lined with pulsating braziers of flame which
&+Lflare up in unison along the entire length of the corridor.  Almost as if the
&+Lpalace were alive and breating, each brazier pulsates in turn before returning
&+Lto a more subdued light.  High above upon the ceiling, spiralling shafts of
&+Lrock spin towards the ground, growing ever thinner and sharper as they come
&+Lwithin half the distance from roof to floor.  The tips of the spikes glow
&+La &+rdeep red &+Lin color, perhaps indicating that there is more to them than
&+Lis currently visible.  The entryway to the Charcoal Palace lies to the east,

&+LA &+RGrand Foyer &+Lwithin the Palace&n~
&+r   The Grand Foyer is the initial welcoming room for all of &+RKossuth's
&+rhonored guests.  The area has been decorated with the finest in magically
&+rcreated Efreet silks, lavish stonework murals and opalescent furniture that
&+rreflects the fiery light that pours into the room.  Much of the room is
&+rseemingly bathed in a hue of gentle red, which shifts in color ever so gently
&+rwith the passing of time.  Servants of &+RKossuth &+rand other minions can be
&+rseen attending to various duties within the foyer.  A grand onyx dais sits
&+rseveral feet off the floor, holding the &+Lotherworldly &+rthrone of the
&+RLord of Flame&+r.  It is presently unoccupied, however.&n

&+LHallway in the Charcoal Palace~
&+L   This decadent hallway is lined with pulsating braziers of flame which
&+Lflare up in unison along the entire length of the corridor.  Almost as if the
&+Lpalace were alive and breating, each brazier pulsates in turn before returning
&+Lto a more subdued light.  High above upon the ceiling, spiralling shafts of
&+Lrock spin towards the ground, growing ever thinner and sharper as they come
&+Lwithin half the distance from roof to floor.  The tips of the spikes glow
&+La &+rdeep red &+Lin color, perhaps indicating that there is more to them than
&+Lis currently visible.  The entryway to the Charcoal Palace lies to the east,

&+rThe Forge of &+RKossuth&n~
&+r   A forge of incredible heat and intense flame dominates the room and dwarfs
&+rall who would come within range.  Massive bellows to either side of the forge
&+rcontinuously open and close providing fresh air to the voracious heat within
&+rthe furnace.  The bellows appear to be mechanically controlled through an
&+rintricate series of gears, pulleys and sprockets.  The bellows themselves are
&+ra marvel of construction, consisting of stretched dragonwing sandwiched
&+rbetween twin cold-iron plates.  The entire contraption glows with an aura of
&+rmagic that's intensity rivals the forge's heat.  The rest of the room is
&+rcomparatively drab and uninteresting.&n

&+rThe &+LLavishly Appointed &+rQuarters of a &+RMagi&n~
&+r   Several thousand scrolls, texts, books, manuscripts, tomes, bibles, and
&+rother written works are strewn about this room in haphazard piles and
&+rcollections.  Works from great human writers lie next to blackened and burnt
&+rscrolls from the deepest pits of Avernus and beyond.  The bed, if you can call
&+rit that, is unkempt and falling apart.  The rugs upon the floor are threadbare
&+rand rotting, though they still possess a faint aura of magical protection.  A
&+rdim fire roils quietly in a fireplace off to the southern side of the room,
&+rscarcely throwing any light out of the blackened ashes that still billow small
&+rwisps of smoke upwards.  The only true exit from this alcove lies to the west.&n

&+L   Massive slabs of obsidian rest upon the ground, creating daises that lie

&+Lmassive, the treasures contained within are few.  More value must be placed

&+YA Wonderous &+mBallroom &+Ywithin the &+LPalace&n~
&+m  This area is nothing less than incredible.  A vast room with high ceilings,
&+mcaryatid columns of angelic and cherubic figures, golden furniture trimmings
&+mand lavish rugs and draperies.  The pervasive heat of the palace has been
&+msubdued here, as &+RKossuth &+mhas obviously taken great care to treat his
&+mmost honored guests well.  Several servants move about the area, tending to
&+mthe needs of the gathered guests.  A fountain of beautifully crafted marble
&+mspills crystal clear liquid down from its crest.  The fountain lies upon the
&+meastern side of the area, away from the main furnishings where emissaries and

&+Lof the palace is engulfed in flames that drift along the bottom surface of
&+Lceiling.  Small flares of fire billow outwards and touch the dark stone
&+Lfloors, before returning to the maelstrom above.  The heat has gone up
&+Lseveral notches here and everything seems crisp and dry.  A guard checkpoint
&+Lhas been set up here in what looks to be an impromptu gathering of security
&+Lin response to some unknown threat.&n

&+Lis particularly odd, as remnants of a battle that waged here not long ago are
&+Lstill visible. Splatters of charred blood mar the surfaces of several pillars
&+Land the walls. A broken silver arrow, the tip of a mithril sword and some other
&+Lmiscellaneous debris of warfare can be seen.  What might have happened or when

&+Lstone wind their way upwards, slowly melding into a flowing stairway that

   &+wA break in the smooth upper crust of the mountain dives several feet

&+Lwhat visible length can be seen, however, the meandering break in the surface
&+Lmoves laterally out of sight to the north.  Dangerous protruding spires of
&+Lvolcanic rock make traversing the fissure a trecherous task.  A raw heat

&+Lthe dark stone which makes up the Charcoal Palace here.  As the servants of
&+rKossuth &+Lare generally non-sentient beings, the alcove itself is sparsely
&+Ldecorated and otherwise completely utilitarian in nature and appearance.  A
&+Lsquad of guards could easily occupy the room, waiting for the moment they were
&+Lneeded. Once empty, this room feels oddly &+wcalm&+L.&n
