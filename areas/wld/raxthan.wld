&+LNarrow &+wPassage &+LInside a Dark Cave&n~
&+L   The walls in this cave are dark and &+Bcold&+L.  Sounds can be heard coming from&n
&+Lthe south.  Drops of &+bwater &+Lfall from the ceiling above hitting your head.  A&n
&+Lstrange smell of brimstone is in the room here.  You also notice some crude&n
&+Ldrawings on the walls.  It shows what appears to be a giant beast whipping what&n
&+Llooks like some sort of female humanoid.  Perhaps this is a warning of some&n
&+Lkind, or maybe it has something to do with the history of the creatures that&n
&+Lmay dwell or have dwelled here.&n

&+Lcoming from the south.  The stench of brimstone is very stong within the arid&N

&+Lpictures seem to show smaller humanoid creatures being tortured by a larger&N

markings crimson pentagram goat~
&+L   This symbol has been drawn here by one of those who is of the &+wunlight&+L.  It&N
&+Ldepicts a goat within an inverted pentagram that is enclosed by a circle.  The&N
&+Whorns&+L of the beast are thrust upward in denial of the &+rtr&+Ri&+rn&+Ri&+rty&+L and the mouth is&N
&+Lpointed downward.  The ears of this being flow to the east and to the west and&N
&+Lare within the points of the pentagram.  The eyes of this black goat seem to&N
&+Lpenetrate the soul and sends an eerie &+Bchill&+L within the body.  Fears long since&N
&+Lthought dead invade the mind and become the present.  The regrets of your life&N
&+Lbecomes all that you can think of.  You wonder how you could of been so wrong&N
&+Lin following the light.  D&+barkne&+Lss is the true power and to deny that is to&N
&+Lremain feeble.  The visions blur and twist into an odd array of nothingness.&N

heads animals mounted trophies~
&+L   The heads of fallen creatures adorn the southern wall.  They consist of an&N
&+Lowlbear, displacer beast, &+Wunicorn&+L, giant, &+gtroll&+L, black dragon, &+yhalfling&+L, and&N
&+Lseveral &+rduergars&+L.  Most likely these &+wtrophies &+Lwere collected by a very skilled&N
&+Lhunter.  Some of them seem like they were killed in a way to make them suffer.&N
&+LPerhaps they were slain in mortal kombat or in self defense.&N
~
E
owlbear~
&+L   This creature seems to be a creation of some demented wizard, or perhaps a&N
&+bmystic &+Lbet.  The monster seems to be a cross between an &+yowl &+Land a bear of some&N
&+Lsort.  The beak of this being is an &+Wivory &+Lcolour and the terrifying eyes are&N
&+Lred-&+rr&+Ri&+rmm&+Re&+rd&+L.  Life no longer fills this entity with aggression or torment, once&N
&+Lfeared now only another trophied head forced into &+wdead&+L.&N
~
E
displacer beast~
&+L   Eyes that glow with an eerie green &+Ghaze&+Ld look even in dismal cold death.&N
&+RF&+ra&+Rng&+rs &+Lof forgotten fury dotted by stains of slain prey that can no longer pray.&N
&+LThe head of a puma like beast that gave so many release from the lie of life.&N
&+LA hunter that was hunted and lost the final fight, &+Rcursed &+Lto be locked as an&N
&+Leternal &+wtrophy&+L.  Mounted and displayed as if a pathetic prize captured within&N
&+Lthe time it had to live.  A mind that is not one with the once broad bulky body&N
&+Lof a hateful being.  &+rScars &+Lof battles that were not the last still can be seen&N
&+Lupon the &+bface &+Lof this fallen foe.&N
~
E
unicorn~
&+L   This head comes from the mystical creature known as the &+Wunicorn&+L.  This once&N
&+Lpowerful steed has a gleaming coat of pure white &+Whair&+L.  The eyes of this being&N
&+Lare a &+bdeep &+Bsea &+Cblue &+Lthat no longer hold life within them.  Long, silky white&N
&+Lstrands of &+Whair &+Lhang down from the mane and forelock.  A single &+Wivory&+L-colored&N
&+Lhorn that spans about three feet in length grows from the center of the colt's&N
&+Lforehead.  The &+Wpowder &+Lbeard beneath the entity's chin spans around one foot in&N
&+Lsize.  This noble beast once dwelled inside majestic &+ywood&+Llands with his mate,&N
&+Lnow he is just another &+wtrophy &+Lfor the delight of a hunter.  No longer to see&N
&+Lthe &+Rs&+ru&+Rn &+Lrise, only to be &+rdamned &+Lto wander in the &+Reternal &+Ldemonical &+Ct&+cw&+Ci&+cl&+Ci&+cg&+Ch&+ct&+L.&N

E
giant~
&+L   A head that once rested upon a body that could bring untold dread.  Eyes of&N
&+Lfallen &+Rfire&+L, now do not hold even a &+wflicker &+Lof desire.  A creature that walked&N
&+Lthe lands, causing all who saw to feel feeble fear.  This huge head most likely&N
&+Lwas not handed over to the hunter without a fearsome fight.  You wonder how a&N
&+Lbeing that held so much might could be forced to lose sight.  Inside your glad&N
&+Lthat this monster is no longer able to deal out any despair.  No feelings of&N
&+Lloss are felt for this slain bitter beast.  Feasting on &+rflesh &+Lof mortals can&N
&+Lnot be done for the giant is just that.&N
~
E
troll~
&+L   Green &+gskin &+Lfilled with untold unholy sin, &+Reyes &+Lof fire burn with hatred for&N
&+Lall those who dare to stare.  A glare from beyond forcing mortal &+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+Cs &+Lto &+rburn&N
&+Lwith dismal despair.  The creature is mounted and a plaque at the bottom of it&N
&+Lhas the word &+gF&+Gr&+ge&+Gn &+Letched into it.  Perhaps this is just wishful thinking or&N
&+Lcould this be the head of the legend himself.  Wonder can only continue till&N
&+Lthe &+bnight &+Lfades into the day, hide in the light or he shall end your sight.&N
&+LCare for the plight of none, he only needs to hunt as one, not even in fear of&N
&+Lthe sun.  Winds of death wash over shores of &+rK&+Lar&+ra&+L-&+rS&+Lheh&+rr&+L, broken &+Wbones &+Ldrift on&N
&+Ltides of torment.  &+wOnly death is real&+L, reality is nothing but a dark delusion.&N

E
black dragon~
&+L   This head seems to of come from a rather old black dragon.  Eyes that once&N
&+Lheld &+revil &+Ldesire, no longer even flicker with a glint of &+Rfire&+L.  &+WFangs &+Lfilled&N
&+Lwith ferocious fury, now simply act as a symbol of a creature that once was.&N
&+LCreature of the &+bnight&+L, bringer of untold fright, might once made it right and&N
&+Lnow the being lacks even sight.  Decapatated in a &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd&+ry &+Lfight or slain while&N
&+Lthe monster was simply faded into sleep.  A myth now forced into a memory with&N
&+Lonly a pathetic &+wtrophy &+Lof what it once was.&N
~
E
halfling~
&+L   The head of this small &+yhalfling &+Lseems to show signs that it was bashed by a&N
&+Lblunt object.  &+BEyes &+Lof blue that no longer know the lie that is called by many&N
&+Llife.  Long gangly brown &+yhair &+Lthat once flowed past shoulders now simply flows&N
&+Lwithout reason.  Now simply a head that has become a &+wtrophy &+Lof a game hunter.&N
~
E
duergars several dorfs~
&+L   These heads of fallen &+rduergars &+Lhave been preserved almost without flaw.  As&N
&+Lyou gaze at the decapatated heads you wonder how and by who they were slain by.&N
&+LThe heads number three in total, the first head has lifeless brown &+yeyes&+L, a long&N
&+Lgangly beard that is an ebon color, ears that seem at least five sizes to big&N
&+Lfor the creature and the name &+wSlappy &+Lhas been etched into the plaque that rests&N
&+Lbelow the head.  The second head has eyes of &+rhat&+Lr&+re&+Ld that have been snuffed of&N
&+Lany life, ears that stick out colored an odd tan, teeth that have mostly fell&N
&+Linto &+Rrot &+Land left the being long before death, a &+Wbeard &+Lof white that no longer&N
&+Lholds any fight and the name &+bT&+Le&+bz&+Lc&+ba&+Lt has been etched at the bottom of the beast.&N
&+LThe third head of the final one who is dead, &+weyes &+Lno longer fueled with hatred&N
&+Lor futile desire, fire that has &+rburn&+Led the ears of this small creature, teeth&N
&+Lthat know little more then &+wdecay &+Land &+Rrot&+L, hair of raven blackness that flowed&N
&+Lat one time upon a back of burden, an unruley beard that has heard voices from&N
&+Lbeyond the grave, the name &+rGlovk &+Letched into the &+ctarnished &+Lplaque that the once&N
&+Lproud neck of this dwarf has been mounted into.  Sounds of suffering can almost&N
&+Lbe heard as you gaze into the eyes of these once mighty warriors.  No longer to&N
&+Lfight for what they thought to be right, death is now their final plight.  Yet&N
&+Lthat was not enough, forced to be &+wtrophies &+Lforever locked into &+rt&+Ro&+rrm&+Re&+rnt&+Led peril.&N

&+L   This dark magenta colored &+minsignia &+Ldoes not seem to be one that is of the&N
&+Lfeeble light.  Most likely it spawns from that which is known as the &+wunlight&+L,&N
&+Lthe true might.  Only those with the sight can ever see, never to be right,&N
&+Lliving just to fight.  Serve the &+revil &+Ltill the day of no longer, worship the&N
&+Lmaster or die.  &+mDarkuul &+Lis the dark lord who shall deliver us from the hordes&N
&+Lof &+Chumans&+L.  The &+Ydwarves &+Lshall be tossed as they always have been, as in the now&N
&+Land what becomes the past.  Words of wisdom no longer hold meaning in the realm&N
&+Lof mortals.  Those that seem to be &+WImmortal &+Lmust kill all who dare to stand in&N
&+Ltheir way.  Mercy is for the meek who shall be given nothing and all shall be&N
&+Ltaken from them.  Power creates the rules, hiding in the shadows the goodies&N
&+Llurk in their pathetic groups.  Men of twenty yet not even to have one, all for&N
&+Lthemselves and nothing for the all.  Reality starts to fade into your eyes and&N

&+Lthe dead beckon to the &+cs&+Co&+cu&+Cl&+L.  Twisted &+bs&+Be&+brp&+Be&+bnts &+Lfrom the &+Bsea &+Lwrap around blades&N
&+Lof a double edged sabre.  Eyes of demonic &+Rhunger &+Lburn with hate, seeking just&N
&+Lto end mortal fate.  Scales of sorrow mask a heart of black dismal death, the&N
&+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+Cs &+Lof the lost taken to satisfy the infernal beasts.  Ancient rites spoken&N
&+Lby priests who are from the darkest domains.  The stare of &+rsuffering &+Lflows to&N
&+Lthe bottom of your &+Wspine&+L, suddenly not everything seems to be close to fine.&N

&+Land weapons.  As you gaze you start to drift into the past.  You see the &+Rf&+ri&+Rr&+re&+Rs&N

&+Lfeelings of joy fill your soul.  Shivers slowly slipping down your spine, your&N
&+Lfeeling far past fine.  No need to ever look for a feeble sign.  The world of&N
&+Lman soon shall end.  Torment does not exist, suffering forgotten along with the&N
&+Lsins of strife.  Life becomes grand, a life born stand, colors soon shall fade&N

&+Lwas the fabled object.  Beasts of many eyes descended and stole what was never&N
&+Lmeant to be for their kind.  The mystical magical force of the &+Gm&+gonk&+Gey &+Lwas set&N
&+Lto the use of the &+revil &+Lones.  &+RFl&+ra&+Rm&+re&+Rs &+Lof torment fell upon the people who dared&N
&+Lto live in what was supposed to be &+Wpeace&+L.  Cries from those who were raped and&N
&+Lbeaton to death echo in the now darkened &+wsky&+L.  Torture turns to torment of the&N
&+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+Cs &+Lthat are now forever to be lost in the black abyss.  Winds from the past&N
&+Lblow into the present, soon to be the future, never shall mortals shed vision&N
&+Lin the dark.  Songs of suffering ring out in the Raven Realms, the dead shall&N
&+Lwalk in the light once more.  Those of the &+wunlight &+Lshall rule the world, kill&N
&+Lall who dare to even cast a stare to oppose.  Rivers of &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd &+Lflow, flickering&N
&+Ldreams of life no longer hold any meaning.  &+CSh&+Wi&+Cv&+We&+Crs &+Lslowly roll down along the&N
&+Wspine&+L, causing you to feel other then fine.  Sun never to shine again, demons&N
&+Ldwell within the realms that man thinks himself the ruler of.  Deception from&N
&+Lthose who seek only to gain power for themselves.  What is thought to be real&N
&+Lfor you starts to fade back into mortal view.  You realize this is just a fake&N

&+L   As you gaze at the &+gs&+Ge&+grp&+Ge&+gnt&+Gi&+gn&+Ge &+Lcreature you notice the word '&+RLeviathan&+L' has&N
&+Lbeen etched into its tail.  Perhaps this is here for a reason, or perhaps it&N
&+Lsimply is another relic from the past.  Sounds of battle start to fade into&N
&+Lyour mind, the cries for mercy do not matter.  You start to see women slayed&N
&+Lalongside their children.  A dark figure is upon a hill and stares at you with&N
&+Lhis &+Rglowing &+Ldread red eyes.  The being does not seem to have a face yet it is&N
&+Lthere filling your soul with despair.  The &+wDea&+Lth &+wD&+Lealer sits on top of a black&N
&+Lsteed, perhaps a n&+bightma&+Lre.  For you know that this is worse than any, because&N
&+Lyou know it to be real.  Birds of prey circle the darkened evil &+wsky &+Lwaiting to&N
&+Lfeast upon your mortal flesh.&N

statue~
&+L   This &+wstatue &+Lhas been crafted from the finest grade of obsidian stone.  Not&N
&+Leven a hint of a flaw is evident upon the dark surface.  The object depicts a&N
&+Lgreat warrior wielding a large &+Rhellfire &+Lsword in both of his hands.  Armor of&N
&+Ldemonical despair cloaks the well proportioned body.  A symbol of a &+wgoat &+Lhangs&N
&+Lfrom the neck of this chiseled creature.  Crimson words have been engraved into&N
&+Lthe base of this item.  They state '&+ROnly &+rdeath &+Ris real&+r, &+Ronly &+rdeath &+Ris pure&+r, the&N
&+rend is only the beginning.&+L'  At the bottom of the writing is a dedication that&N
&+Lreads '&+wIn memory of &+LBerethorn -Da&+ro&+Ll&+ro&+Lth-.'&N

&+r   This is a &+Lsymbol&+r that has been soaked in &+Rblood&+r.  The image consists of a&N

&+rincluded inside the pentagram itself.  The &+Whorns &+rof the &+Lgoat &+rare thrust upward&N
&+rin denial of the &+Rtr&+ri&+Rn&+ri&+Rty&+r.  The mouth downward and the ears occupy the east and&N
&+rwest points.  The eyes of this creature seem to glare with an unholy sort of&N
&+raware.  You feel a shiver run down along your &+Wspine&+r, meanwhile your feeble mind&N
&+ris telling you that everything is just fine.  Thoughts of the past start to&N
&+Linvade &+rthe present, causing resent to resurface and regret to run rampant.&N

&+LMost likely these mystical drawings have been drawn by those who are not of the&N

dragon scaled~
&+L   Scales of darkness upon a beast of dismal despair.  The eyes of fire burn in&N
&+Lsockets of &+rp&+Ra&+rg&+Ra&+rn &+Rf&+ri&+Rr&+re&+L.  Beastial images of death fade into your mind and shiver&N
&+Ldown along your spine.  Nothing no longer seems to be even close to fine.  A&N

&+Lyour brain from the nine hells of the infernal plane.  Dreams of the lost are&N
&+Lforever to be no longer.  Screams of torment ring out within your head, yes&N
&+Lfilling you with dread.  The wings of this beast span at least eighteen feet&N
&+Lacross and have stains of dried crimson on them.  The claws of terror also have&N

&+Lthe true warriors of this realm and any other.  The battle comes to life you&N
&+Lsee the vyking horde destroying legions of lesser warriors with greater armies.&N
&+LYet they are not even a match for the true hordes of the berserker masters, not&N
&+Lthe would be zerkers that have been unleashed in many places.  These are the&N
&+Lreal deal that are the facts and not the balanced weaklings that many wish to&N
&+Lbe truth.  They slash and cut their way threw their out classed enemies, they&N
&+Lalmost seem to be having fun.  The &+Wnordic &+Bthunder &+Ldestroys all that dare to&N
&+Lstand in the path of &+rKvasir &+Land his &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd &+Lborn troops.  The mighty one can be&N

&+Whorns&+L of the beast are thrust upward in denial of the &+rtr&+Ri&+rn&+Ri&+rty&+L and the mouth is&N
&+Lpointed downward.  The ears of this being flow to the east and to the west and&N
&+Lare within the points of the pentagram.  The eyes of this black goat seem to&N
&+Lpenetrate the soul and sends an eerie &+Bchill&+L within the body.  Fears long since&N
&+Lthought dead invade the mind and become the present.  The regrets of your life&N
&+Lbecomes all that you can think of.  You wonder how you could of been so wrong&N
&+Lin following the light.  D&+barkne&+Lss is the true power and to deny that is to&N

&+Ldefy the d&+barkne&+Lss burn in the &+Ct&+cw&+Ci&+cl&+Ci&+cg&+Ch&+ct &+Lof &+wunlight&+L.  Suffering of the fallen&N
&+Lfools who thought they could survive the fires of the black abyss.  Screams of&N
&+Ltorment, torture of the meek, death to any who seek.  Focus wishes it was no&N
&+Llonger as reality fades into a &+bnight&+Lmare.  Heads upon stakes, &+Rbl&+ro&+Ro&+rd &+Lapon thine&N
&+Lground, eyes rolled by fatal fate.  Hate of the light, &+Bthunder &+Lcrackles within&N
&+Lthe demonic air.  &+CSh&+Wi&+Cv&+We&+Crs &+Lslowly stream down your &+Wspine&+L, nothing at all seems&N
&+Lto be even near fine.  Time drifts into limbo, what is real no longer can be&N
&+Lrealized for sure.  Images from the past becomes the present, resent, descent,&N
&+Lall flowing into &+Rpain&+L.  &+CRain &+Lof &+Ws&+Ce&+Wrp&+Ce&+Wnt&+Ci&+Wn&+Ce &+Lwinter falls from out the &+wclouded&N
&+Lsky of the raven realms.  Flickering, fading, changing, pupils dilate, things&N
&+Lalmost drift back into sane.  Insane voices echo inside your hollow head, yet&N
&+Lyou can not make out what they are saying.  &+wWhispers &+Lfrom beyond eternal &+bnight&N
&+Lfill the body with untold fright.  Might makes right, no matter the height, to&N
&+Ldestroy those who dare to ever care.  Cast them not but a &+Bcold &+Llifeless stare,&N
&+Lmurder them in cold &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd&+L.  You realize to dream that is your death once more.&N

insignia darkuul~
&+L   This dark magenta colored &+minsignia &+Ldoes not seem to be one that is of the&N
&+Lfeeble light.  Most likely it spawns from that which is known as the &+wunlight&+L,&N
&+Lthe true might.  Only those with the sight can ever see, never to be right,&N
&+Lliving just to fight.  Serve the &+revil &+Ltill the day of no longer, worship the&N
&+Lmaster or die.  &+mDarkuul &+Lis the dark lord who shall deliver us from the hordes&N
&+Lof &+Chumans&+L.  The &+Ydwarves &+Lshall be tossed as they always have been, as in the now&N
&+Land what becomes the past.  Words of wisdom no longer hold meaning in the realm&N
&+Lof mortals.  Those that seem to be &+WImmortal &+Lmust kill all who dare to stand in&N
&+Ltheir way.  Mercy is for the meek who shall be given nothing and all shall be&N
&+Ltaken from them.  Power creates the rules, hiding in the shadows the goodies&N
&+Llurk in their pathetic groups.  Men of twenty yet not even to have one, all for&N
&+Lthemselves and nothing for the all.  Reality starts to fade into your eyes and&N
&+Lyou gaze at what seems to be the symbol of a d&+barkne&+Lss.&N

demonical creature~
&+L   Eyes that have gazed upon the nine hells, wings that have glided upon the&N

&+Ldespair.  Horns that are thrust upward in denial of the feeble trinity.  A&N
&+LKris style pitchfolk with waves of hatred burned into it.  This creature seems&N
&+Lto be almost alive.  A cold &+Bchill &+Lfrom beyond shivers down your mortal &+Wspine&+L.&N
&+LYour eyes start to burn with sorrow of those who have wronged you in your past.&N
&+LHatred overcomes you as you decide it is time to strike down your enemies once&N

&+Lflow within your mortal mind.  Fine no longer, mine once again, you wonder why&N
&+Levil must die.  Gazing into the &+Rs&+re&+Rrp&+re&+Rnt&+ri&+Rn&+re &+Rs&+rk&+Ry&+L, reality fades back again and&N

&+LDismal Chamber Within a &+WBone &+LFilled Cavern&n~
&+L   This chamber spans at least thirty feet in total height.  Drops fall from&N
&+Lout of the darkness that lurks above.  The moisture forms in tiny &+bpools &+Lthat&N
&+Lrest upon the surface of the ghastly ground.  &+WBones &+Land other debris are strewn&N
&+Labout the cavern in a chaotic disarray.  A strong stench of death and decay is&N
&+Lalmost too much for the lungs of mortals to handle.  The western wall has the&N
&+Lwords '&+rThose that go down&+L, &+rshall never come back up&+L' written in &+Rblood&+L.&N

&+LA &+WBone &+LFilled Chamber &+RAdorned &+LBy &+rShrunken &+LHeads&N~
&+W   Bones &+Llay scattered upon the wicked demonical ghastly ground.  The heads of&N
&+Lshrunken fools adorn the wicked worn walls.  Remnants from the past, serving as&N
&+Lwarnings to those that may dare dwell out of the &+Ct&+cw&+Ci&+cl&+Ci&+cg&+Ch&+ct&+L.  Images flicker into&N
&+Lforgotten fade, memories that still stab at the heart.  Some pain will last,&N
&+Luntil the dusk of final release.  Death and decay dominate within this abode&N
&+Lof abysmal final fate.  Symbols not of salvation adorn the east wall, etchings&N
&+bb&+Lurned into sadistic ston&+be &+Lby cold c&+br&+Limson.  A chamb&+be&+Lr of chaos, where order is&N

orc~

&+Lthe feeble light.  Da&+ro&+Ll&+ro&+Lth of darkness who rides the planes of nightmares, a&N
&+Lminion of Bl&+rash&+Lyrk&+rh&+L.  Dweller in the realms of ravens, he who follows the dark&N
&+Lforces of fate.  Master of hate, dealer of dismal ever lasting death.  Laughs&N

&+Lto feeble foes.  Wielder of many artifacts, killer of many goodies, now another&N
&+Lvictim of death.  Simply another trophy upon a wall of wicked delight.  &+RKilled&N

&+Lin the nocturnal night.  Hunter of those who are weak enough to pray.  Master&N

&+Lof death and dismay.  Now he is simply another trophy for the diabolical head&N

&+Ladorn the northern wall.  A strong stench fills the arid air here, causing the&N

&+LCollapsed Chamber Within a &+WBone &+LFilled Cavern&n~
&+L   This cavern spans about thirty feet in total height.  Drops of &+bliquid &+Lfall&N
&+Lfrom out of the raven blackness that lurks above.  The ground here is all but&N
&+Lgone, with only specs of land at most.  &+WBones &+Land stains of &+Rblood &+Lare strewn&N
&+Labout in a chaotic manner.  Sounds not of this world can be heard coming from&N
&+Lthe chamber beneath this place.  The stench of death and decay are almost too&N
&+Lmuch for feeble mortal lungs to endure.&N

&+LThe Blood &+rS&+Roa&+rke&+Rd &+LLair of &+rGraskal&N~
&+R   Bl&+ro&+Ro&+rd &+Lstains the ancient walls of this evil dismal abysmal abode.  Marks of&N
&+Lthose long since cast into eternal past.  Remnants serving as reminders to all&N
&+Lwho may dare to dwell within this dreary hell.  Screams slash the &+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+L, wounds&N
&+Lthat shall never ever heal.  Pain that drives mortals insane, images none shall&N

&+Lvicious ground.  Symbols of salvation, of uncreation, crumbling into &+wdust&+L.&N

&+W   Bones &+Ladorn the ground of this collapsing charred chamber.  Specs of light&N
