Rocky Ledge~
The ledge doesn't look as if it can support much weight, but gets
more broad to the east and north.  Off in the distance, a small
black mountain stands defiantly against the vast emptiness of
astral space.  There is limited gravity here, but the weight of an
average human is still only about twenty pounds.  Back to the west
the astral plane extends on forever.

Base of a Small Mountain~
   This mountain doesn't seem to be very tall by most standards,
and is composed of what looks like black granite, or some other
hard stone.  Large gouges and uneven cracks in the stone indicate
that this mountain must have been ripped away from the prime
material plane somehow.  The gravity here is a bit more intense,
but is still only about half of normal.  It does look possible to
ascend the mountain easily from several different pathways leading
upwards. A path leads up from here, and the trail around the
mountain runs east and west.

Trail Around the Base of the Mountain~
   The gravel trail is about ten feet wide, and runs west to south.
A much steeper trail leads up from here onto the mountain, which
looms ominously above.  The skeleton of a long-dead humanoid is
here,  pinned to the ground by a very large metal spear.  It seems
to have been robbed of anything valuable.  The rusted out armor
indicates that it was probably a warrior.

Dead-End on a Mountain Trail~
   The trail dead-ends here into a rocky wall.  The remains of some
fifteen dead humanoids lay strewn about, most of them warriors like
the one on the trail.  It looks as if this was a stand-off of some
kind, in which this pathetic band obviously lost.  What makes the
scene more gruesome is that is looks as if they were burned to
death, with skeletons charred and black, armor melted and deformed.
In the far corner one large shield lies half-melted into the stone,
but the symbol on its face is unmistakable.  The crest of Lord
Redferne..

Base of a Small Mountain~
   This mountain looks steeper from this angle, with a huge smooth
wall of rock rising up into the silver sky.  A small inscription
has been carved into the stone by a crude instrument.  It does not
look possible to ascend the mountain easily from here.  The trail
around the mountain leads north and south.

Rocky Mountain~
     The view from this height shows the trail leading all the way

generally north to east from here, and a steep rocky pathway leads
back down the mountain.  High above near the mountain's top, a dark
blemish can be seen.

   This very thin ledge doesn't look as if it was made to be
traveled by any but the most courageous and foolhardy.  Gravity
also seems to be a bit thicker at this height, making things even
more dangerous.  The ledge runs north too south, and a small trail
heads east from here to a steep rise. Decent down the mountain is
possible from here via a Very thin pathway.  High above, the crest
of the mountain can be seen, along with an odd dark blemish just

Cave Mouth on the Mountain Top~
   The view of the mountain below is stunning, and the gravity here
seems to have reduced itself to more of the astral norm. There is
a huge cave mouth here, about a hundred feet around, and cutting
strait into the mountain at a downwards angle.  It seems to have
been burned out, rather than a naturally created feature of the
rock.  To the north and south the mountain slopes down slightly,
and a steep rise runs downward from here.

exit from this area is back to the south, where the trail runs
around the mountain's base.  To the east, the ancient looking
mountain stands, with many small ledges and pathways leading up
