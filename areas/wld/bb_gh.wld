   The earth here has been ripped apart by a fiery rift.  Its edges
burning the very earth itself, causing it to melt and run into the

stepping within.  A sulphurous smell emanates from within, whilst what
can only be described as the screams of the damned echo faintly upwards
from the fiery depths below.

   The rock here has been melted into a smooth surface, long since
cold.  All above the rock a fiery shaft burns through solid rock,
yet the heat does not seem to affect the surrounding area.  The
intensity of the inferno seems to increase, feeding off some unknown
force.  Several small alcloves exit onto this cool area, their walls
also melted, possibly bubbles from the blaze above.  The cold black
floor seems to shimmer under any light, perhaps containing some life
force of a creature that can only be dreamt about.

A strange current of air sweeps up from below, allowing the room to

fire, small explosions erupt across the surface as if the two energies
