&+LA Large Charcoal Mass~
   This section of the town has been used as a bond fire area. Trees have been
cut down at a whim to be burned during a celebration of any sort. There are
often times no particular reason to celebrate anything during one of these
feasts, however, it is in the cow's rape to burn and pillage, and when they're
not doing either one they must fill their time up and release built up rage.
Bones from animals are strewn about the area, their meat is the most often
eaten during such times, broken wine bottles are also visible, all of them
empty and most of them broken. It's hard to tell a cow what to do during these
times, therefore it's rare to see anyone of them hold anything back.

Before a Large &nIron&+y Gate~
   The cobblestoned road below has been paved over the years by being steadily
walked upon. A slight breeze often picks up during odd hours of the day blowing
the lightly packed dirt off the side of the trail onto the road. During the
night people often mistake the dirt picked up by the breeze brushing against
their persons as a beast of some kind. It's difficult to differentiate
between the paranormal and the natural order of nature during such hours. Most
of the cows that reside within this town have the temperament of a woman during
pms, and such they don't like to be annoyed. A large building to the southwest
looks to be made of stone and must house a great many people for it is huge.
A tent just to the northwest has an open flap flapping in the wind, many booted
footprints lead into this building.

&+yTent of Fallen Armaments~
&+y   The number of weapons within this room are numerous. They lay scattered
&+yupon shelves and racks. Most of the weapons are in desperate need of mending,
&+yhowever, they can inflict mortal wounds none the less. Tents are notoriously
&+ystuffy, which is why the flap remains open during all times so fresh air might
&+yenter. This shop mainly serves the barracks, however, a few private venders
&+yare known to buy up many of the goods when their own shops run low on material
&+ysuch as iron or steel. They then melt down the steel, then they filter out
&+ythe impurities, and alas the steel is ready to be molded again into something
&+ymore deadly.

&+yBefore a Stoned Barracks~
   There is a stoned barracks to the south that must have taken an incredible
concerted effort by the cows to build. It must house the town's defenses while
they're not on duty. There are very few windows within the barracks, however,
there are many outdoor sparring arenas available to those who wish to exercise
their bloodlust in open combat. Truly this barracks contrasts with the large
tent to the northeast and the large war tower to the northwest. The dirt upon
the ground is gently picked up by the softly blowing wind and covers the
cobblestone road ever so slightly.

&+yBefore A Large Stone Building~
   A large tower to the west looks like a daunting obstacle to an invading
army. It would take many men to successfully take this tower for it is strongly
fortified. The small slits that cover the entire circumference of the base have
but one purpose, for those inside to fire their arrows at the targets exposed
to them, all the while totally safe from and projectile themselves. One might
think that this tower is totally impregnable, however, if an invading army
has gotten as far as here, there's no telling just how long the tower could
hold out. Regardless, the tower contrasts with a large tent to the east, which
looks to be a shop of some sort.

&+LBase of a War Tower~
&+L   This base of the tower has been used as an armory of sorts. Loosely fitting
&+Lsuits of armor are strewn about the place carelessly and swords inadequate for
&+Leven chopping wood lay in various locations around the room. Mortar, stone, and
&+Lbricks have been used to construe this large tower, nothing wooden was allowed
&+Lto even have consideration in the plans for who would want to protect a highly
&+Lflammible tower during a siege? Most of the sentries that keep up watch during
&+Ltheir shift often take naps down here, because for the most part there isn't
&+Lany reason why they shouldn't. Only the scout above has the responsibility of
&+Lsighting possible hostile threats to the town.

   An incredible view awaits those who partook in climbing the stairs below to
reach the top. From this vantage point one can watch rising and setting suns,
feel the light summer breeze, and smell the fresh air. The stone and mortar
that were used to construct this tower seem to be succumbing to the test of
time and no concerted effort has been made to make reparations to the tower.
A large iron rail encloses the alcove of the sentry for the sentry's sake and
for others alike when they are walking along the parapet. A wooden trapdoor in
the center of the floor leads back downstairs.

&+Lto to announce anything that might be announcing, things ranging from what the
&+Lweek's lunch will comprise to things involving possible upcoming battles. It is
&+Lhere where the warrior cows meet regularly to greet old acquaintances and to
&+Lmake new one's alike. Although cows are thought to have a ferocious and almost
&+Lsavage nature, they are most loyal to their own and love and protect each other
&+Llike no other race. Sounds echo within this chamber easily when it is empty,
&+Lhowever, during most of the hours of the day, it is mostly full.

&+LSleeping Quarters~
&+L   Hundreds of double bunked beds run in many rows in columns throughout this
&+Lcramped living space. Soldiers aren't used to privileges, so why sacrifice
&+Lmoney and energy and build a larger sleeping chamber? There are no windows
&+Lin this room, however, there is a disgusting smell lingering in the air, the
&+Lsmell of scat. A latrine entrance is in the far corner of the room, there's no
&+Ldoubt that the smell emanates from there. The cow's that sleep in this room
&+Lmust smell of scat all day, perhaps this is an effective psychological
&+Ltechnique used during battle. The hard cold stone floor is flesh chilling
&+Lduring the winter and it scorches the flesh during the summer, truly these
&+Lare hardened soldiers who sleep here.

&+LBarracks Messhall~
&+L   It is from in here where the barracks's meals are cooked. One must be a
&+Lvery adept chef to be admitted to cook for the soldiers of this town, for one
&+Lslight slip up could result in capital punishment. Food problems ranging from
&+Lfood poisoning to dirty salad have caused cooks to loose their heads. It is a
&+Lvery tricky position, but one that holds a high prestige in the standing
&+Lcommunity. The utensils that are used to cook the food are rather primitive,
&+Lyet if used effectively, they wouldn't cause any problems. Stoves, pots, and
&+Lpans comprises most of the cooking tools. A running stream not far from here
&+Lis a major resource for drinking water and washing water alike.

&+Lenough to build a latrine, for it requires understanding of plumbing and many
&+Lother laws of nature. Cow's aren't stupid however, they're one of the most
&+Lintelligent creatures on Duris, they just aren't known to accomplish such acts
&+Lthat a civilized culture is known for. However, it would make sense if the
&+Lcow's hadn't actually built this facility, perhaps it was apart of a town they
&+Lhad razed and they simply let this small section of it stand. Maybe this holds
&+Ltrue for the entire barracks.

&+WA Town Center&N~
   This is the point where small roads intersect and go their separate
ways. Either of the roads were not finely made, but rather loosely put
together. The cobblestones that were used to construe them are evenly
paved and provide an smooth surface adequate for transporting caravans
and other various machines of war. Some lightly packed dirt on either
side of the trail and in-between the cobblestones look to have been
walked and trampled upon for many ages, hinting at the age of this
encampment. One would think that after such a time a town would prosper
into a city, that is not the cow's way however. Although they are not
the most savage and brutal race on Duris, they are by no means gentle, nor
are they stupid. In fact, most minotaurs possess a very intelligent mind,
if not sinister in nature. It is perfectly natural for these people to
live within small towns and seek refuge only within their own tribe.

road are paved and provide an easy traversing. Wheels glide over this section
of the town quite easily one would think. The dirt off the side of the road
and in-between the cracks of the stones would often times become airborne by
the wind during the day. It would pick up ever so slightly and collide with
a traveler or a building of some sort. The wind when it does this makes a
sharply pitched noise, an eerie noise during the night. There are no poles,
no lanterns, nor any sort of evidence that this road is difficult to travel
during the night, unaccomplished travelers need not worry.

   A few chairs are missing their legs. Some minotaurs have belt the need to
bash another more annoying cow with them, more than one table is splintered
along its edges also, with a few broken in two. The tavern was constructed in
a square shape with the business counter and meat room on the western wing. On
the southern section, a gigantic, elevated, flat, tap floor was constructed.
Dried pools of blood are visible atop of it. Its purpose, to provide ample
entertainment so the customers don't get too rowdy. Many war prisoners come
here to be named guest of honor and then they have the luxury of being beaten
to death by the members of the audience.

   Walls swell with the stench of alcohol. Broken bottles lay in various
places along the floor, some have dried up blood upon their jagged ends.  This
is the only building in town that has been made in earnest, with a brick
foundation. The roof was built u sing wood, as well as the ceiling, however,
the walls were made with brick and mortar. It appears that the immediate area
is a lobby, however, it would seem that the many cow's wrestling around have
had much run during odd hours of the night and during the day.

&+LThese shelves are built in three layers on either side of the room, with a
&+Lvariety of flies and insects buzzing about them The few pieces of worthy
&+Leatting here would be Brukish himself. There are no windows in this meat shop,
&+Lthere is only the entrance way to the east, through a door. Despite the many
&+Ldrawbacks of eating here, the cow's really don't mind eating bad meat,
&+Lbecause they're usually drunk from drinking too much from the tavern to the
&+Least. This meat shop is very profitable, for it is the only meat shop in town.

A Cobblestone Intersection~
   It is here that two roads converge to form an intersection. Both roads were
made of a cobblestone that seems to have been paved over the years by constant
walking upon by the cow's within this town. Caravans and machines of war have
no trouble traversing this intersection, for it is truly grand. A small forest
sits to the east and must have some sort of grove within it, for why would it
still be standing? Birds can be heard chirping from it and animals are sure to
reside there. Large buildings loom in any direction along either road. Toward
the west it seems as though there are residential buildings, while to the north
it would appear that many commercial and various buildings reside, and finally
to the south there are many different types of buildings.

Grass overruns much of the ground off the road, and within the forest the
sounds of animal life are present, as well as raised cow voices shouting.

river, however, there is a small plateau before the forest. The small
cobblestone road on the road breaks up a bit to the north, for it is due for
some reparation. Grass and overgrown weeds begin to take it over, making
travelling a little tedious. Beyond the forest, in some sort of grove, smoke
arises steadily. There must be some sort of settlement.

the east while a forest of sorts looms over the few buildings toward the east.
Grass overruns much of the ground off the road, and within the forest the
sounds of animal life are present, as well as raised cow voices shouting.

Street of the Lost &+rWarrior~
   The cows that traverse this road avoid confronting one another, the ones
that do stop and talk compare battlescars with one another and talk of battles,
glory, fortune, and fame. Most of the cows have multiple battlescars on their
face and arms alike, displaying them as they would medals. The street has been
made of stone blocks suitable for travelling. A building or two lay off towards
the east while a forest of sorts looms over the few buildings toward the east.
Grass overruns much of the ground off the road, and within the forest the

&+LA Burial Ground~
   Made up of bamboo, the fence that protects this place rises over five feet
high. Beautiful oak trees are well over thirty feet tall also, which allows
shade from the sunlight. The grass here doesn't grow all that tall, although
Lit is a beautifully colored green. Little squirrels race along it to pick up
fallen nuts. Around the area, headstones mark the place as a graveyard. It is
La small graveyard, with only a few tombs. There are no signs of city life
and no signs of disturbance. The cow's must hold this place as sacred, because
there is little doubt that fallen warriors are buried here.

&+Lhas had no time to settle amongst the refuse and rubble, hinting at the
&+Lunstability of the cavern. Above, light can be seen marking an entrance of
&+Lsorts. The amount of moisture in the air makes breathing difficult at best.
&+LVines dangle down from the ceiling and grow along the dirt walls on either
&+Lside. Darkness envelopes the area, straining the eyes. The ground gives way
&+Lto a secret entrance that leads underground. A huge cylinder hole curves
&+Ldownwards allowing enough space for entering it and climbing down. Vines
&+Ldangle down from the cavern's ceiling above and the moisture they hold finds
&+Lits way towards the ground in a never ending dripping motion. Darkness
&+Lenvelopes the room, however, the light from above is adequate to suit most.

A Turning~
   The small cobblestones that have been laid some time ago to create this
road are paved and provide an easy traversing. Wheels glide over this section
of the town quite easily one would think. The dirt off the side of the road
and in-between the cracks of the stones would often times become airborne by
the wind during the day. It would pick up ever so slightly and collide with
a traveler or a building of some sort. The wind when it does this makes a
sharply pitched noise, an eerie noise during the night. There are no poles,
no lanterns, nor any sort of evidence that this road is difficult to travel
during the night, unaccomplished travelers need not worry.

&+Lsteps a day. The steps are made of the strongest wood around, ocimian oak.
&+LThis oak was used for building temporarily during the cataclysmic wars
&+Lbetween the ogres and minotaurs. These two barbaric races had neither
&+Lthe resources or the man power to build them themselves, so they higher
&+La lot of orcish and duergar engineers and laborers to do the work.

&+L   The staircase lies in the corner of the corridor, it looks to go up quite
&+La ways. this hallway is narrow and rugged, it is only seven feet in width and
&+Ldoesn't suit big parties coming and going all at once. Slime and refuse, from
&+Lthe outside layer of dirt, make the place a hazard. The corridor is likely
&+Lten feet underground, which accounts for the chill in the air. No fire place

&+Lever complains about it. The corridor leads northward, to a huge wooden door.

&+Lunderdark and the light dwellers. Most of them portray victory over the elves,
&+Lhumans, dwarves, and gnomes alike. the few that tell the story of battles with

&+Lcold floor chills the bone during the winter, for it is made of stone. Stone
&+Lis a conduit of energy, regardless whether it is heat or cold. This place of

   Sounds of city life are audible from above here: warriors shout and laugh
heartedly, sounds of forging of steel ring through the air, and animal life
from the forest to the east. The forest lays just to the east, and within
the central part of it an odd tree has some sort of wooden deck construed on
top of it. Many of the roofs are in very poor condition and remain very
unstable. Over the horizon, beyond the northern walls of this town, a forest
can be seen. The forest is obviously dense and stretches on for miles on
around. Beyond the forest towards the northeast lay some grassy plains, roads
being visible among them leading from this town.

   The wood that once made up the building has all but turned into carbon.
Ashes blow in the breeze. It has never been discovered which culprit within
the city was responsible for the fire, however, the authorities are not
looking into the matter for they fear that if they do, it would only result in
their own bodily harm. The road has turned a sickening black since the ash has
blown on top of it and with the booted feet of hundreds of orcs have imbedded
the ash into the road iteself.

   Huge buildings surround the wide cobblestone road. With a width of about
fifteen feet and with nothing but air standing in-between the houses and walls,
the road is easily navigable as opposed to the poverty stricken majority
slum holes. The buildings on either side of the road are unique to the other
buildings of the city for they were constructed in earnest, with careful
precision not seen in the other parts of the city. Signs hang from each of
their doorways, some more legible than others. The roof tops touch the sky,
while off to the north and south the road continues.

place. A huge rack lays dormant near the ring, with an assortment of weapons
upon it. It is here where future warriors are hardened in the ways of combat.

that it belongs to a rich mercenary. Minotaurs are the best mercenaries within

no windows within this building and their is only one door, which is bolted
closed. The road continues to the south and east. Towards the east a large dome

A Cobblestone Road~
   The small cobblestones that have been laid some time ago to create this
road are paved and provide an easy traversing. Wheels glide over this section
of the town quite easily one would think. The dirt off the side of the road
and in-between the cracks of the stones would often times become airborne by
the wind during the day. It would pick up ever so slightly and collide with
a traveler or a building of some sort. The wind when it does this makes a
sharply pitched noise, an eerie noise during the night. There are no poles,
no lanterns, nor any sort of evidence that this road is difficult to travel
during the night, unaccomplished travelers need not worry.

&+Lcorridor is about eight feet high, giving more than enough room for a minotaur
&+Lto traverse it. However, a huge wooden door stands to the north, looking
&+Lto forbid any unwanted intruder. Audible voices emanate from within, the
&+Lsounds of steel clashing rings through the air.

&+Lleaning up against the norther wall. Mock combat armor hangs next to that. The
&+Larea is filled with sounds of clashing. The clashing sound is coming from the
&+Least, while the weapon's shop lays to the west.

A Path of Dirt~
   Some little rocks are visible along this dirt road. Mud doesn't totally
eclipse them just yet, however, the once totally enveloping trail to the east
has transformed into something that of a road of rocks, paved rocks. These
rocks seem to be made of cobblestone and provide easy access for all of those
who wish to traverse it. Weathering seems to have no hold upon these rocks,
for they have truly survived the test of time. Brushes and large patches of
weeds lay on either side of the path, guarding the algae covered water. Dead
trees lay about the area, however, all are out of reach and lay in shallow
pools of water that makes up the swamp to the east.

&+Lthe table has four chairs around it and stands off in the corner, near the
&+Lwindow. Picture frames have remarkable paintings on them, most of them are
&+Lportraits of the city and blue prints of city structures. An oddly placed sign
&+Lhangs above the staircase. The sign reads "Enter at your own risk". The
&+Lstaircase spirals upwards to the second floor.

&+Llook like they've been put to good use. A gadget of unparalleled ingenuity
&+Lrests next to the table. It has many mechanical levers and switches. It is

&+yA Muddy Trail~
&+y   Sounds of the town to the west fill the air. Everything in the swampy forest
&+yto the east seems to stir stir ever so slightly when anyone enters their waste
&+yland. Many types of tracks lay below in the muck, some of these tracks were
&+ymade by minotaurs, however, many were made by reptiles. Mud inhibits travelling
&+ytand makes progress very difficult. On either side of the pathway of mud lay
&+ythe dead swamp aspect of the area. Water envelopes most of the swamp forest's
&+yground, with a large number of standing and fallen trees alike. Back to the
&+ywest, a cobblestone road opens up and leads toward the town.

&+g   Two large totems stand on either side of the path, both of them the beholder
&+gof heads. The heads lay impaled upon the totems, a warning to all those who
&+gwould attempt to traverse this swamp. They've been there a while one would
&+gsuppose, simply because nearly all of the flesh has rotten away exposing the
&+gskull underneath. Flies swarm the area, small ponds of water alongside many
&+gdead tress outline the area. Below, the ground is very soggy, the muck slows
&+gprogress to nearly a standstill. A small path opens up to the west, which
&+gleads toward civilization.

&+gA Muddy Trail through the Swamp~
&+g   A horrible stench fills the area, a stench resembling that of maneaur that
&+gall cows drop. The plumbing from the town has to run somewhere, so why not
&+ghere. From the smell of it, every minotaur in the city must have dropped many
&+gloads during his trip to the latrine. Most of the swamp is shallow, yet that
&+gdoesn't matter, progress is still very difficult. Atop of some dead trees,
&+gthe fallen ones, moss and a variety of plant life grow steadily. Only the
&+greptiles live within proximity of this smell, for what do they care.

&+yA Long Winding Trail of Mud~
&+y   Mud envelopes the path, making progress for any heavily burdened minotaur
&+ycarrying the spoils of war, slow. The muck sinks a foot deep and stretches
&+ythe entire trail, never to let up. Along the trail, on either side, the rocky
&+yaspect of the swamp comes to life. A large amount of boulders lay scattered
&+yabout the area, they look to have been pushed for they still have leave a
&+ycrater trail from point to point. Just where these boulders were pushed to
&+yis inapprehensible at the moment, for they are not in sight. A horrible smell
&+ysweeps the area, the smell of mud, which resembles maneaur.

&+yAn Old Trail~
&+y   Small rocks are swallowed whole by the mud and the various weeds that
&+yarbitrary grow here. Below, on the ground, there resembles something that once
&+ycould have been a road, but the vegetation alongside a lack of effort to
&+ymaintain it resulted in its erosion by the many elements that envelope the
&+yswamp. Dead trees outline the parameter, with hordes of vines hanging from
&+ythem, which prohibits vision further. The wind makes a wheezing sound as it
&+ypasses through the vines and empty tree branches. A slight smell fills the
&+yair, the smell of maneaur. It is very foul.

Along a &+bRiver~
   The forest thins out to reveal a river in its mist. Much of the ground is
wet for reasons undoubtedly caused by the water of the river. Weeds and
vegetation plague the river's edge and the bushes make great abodes for snakes
and other reptiles. Sounds of the river fill the air as well a the smell that
rapids normally bring, the smell of rain. Animals often come here to drink.
A hill slopes downward towards the river and it still rises to the east. The
white water of the river is caused by the ferociousness of the current
colliding with the rocks underneath that one rarely sees. A large rope and
wooden bridge is anchored by two boulders on this side and two boulders on the
other side. A forest opens up to the east.

&+yBefore a Wooden Bridge~
   Huge boulders rest off to the side of the trail, which is full of mud. Small
puddles of water form within the footsteps of a few massive trolls. Other
markings are among the mud, reptilian tracks are visible, their slithering
ways are hard to miss. The area is turning into a mud land, as opposed to
a swampy forest, however, the swamp is visible just to the west, along with
its dark and smelly ways. Alligators noisily splash in the swamp, they've no
doubt caught some prey and are twisting and turning in a death spiral to shake
the life out of its dinner. Crocodiles like their meat tender, which is why
bury their lunch in the bottom of the swamp, waiting for an hour until they
actually feast upon the flesh. The river to the east has a bridge above it.
The bridge is tied to four huge boulders that are used to anchor it, the bridge
being made of rope and planks and all.

&+yA Bend in a Trail~
   A few dead trees lay in the road, they have been broken off at their base
by marauding minotaurs. Their foot prints in the mud echo just how they move
and where. Many of the trees are still laying about with mud all over them.
Cow's like to work out and keep their muscles strong, they also like to release
a lot of built up rage. They do most of this here. Knocking over trees alleviates
their anger and lifting the trees are used at weights for their workouts. The
mud below shows signs of various prints aside from the booted foot. Broken
eggshells lay scattered about, obviously reptiles inhabit this region of the
muck. The trail spans to the northeast, along a running river.

&+bthat runs towards the southeast. Rocks are visible among the river, for they
&+bare the reason the water runs white. Strong currents provide a fast means of
&+btravel for those who would risk the chance of navigating the river. First jump
&+bout into the river, whether one would survive on their own is left up to the
&+bgods. Only those unafraid of dying should even attempt this.

Nearing a &+bRiver&n~
   Wild life can be heard nearby but they remain unseen however, for the
forestation is very thick. The trees grow an incredible height here and they
block out the sunlight that is the demise of so many nocturnal creatures. A
river is faintly visible towards the west. Many game trails are visible to the
east however, as well to the west. It is obvious that this particular section
of the forest is a hot spot amongst the animals for it provides about the
only drinking water readily available in the region. One thing the river
isn't to those who dwell in this region is safe to travel.

   The denseness of the forest forbids sunlight from even reaching the ground.
The eerieness of the darken wood seems to spell danger of sorts. the darkened
trees may be the product of ears of little to no sunlight, the trees are
however, living. The game trails on the ground are beginning to thin out a
little, they are still numerous thought. The darkened trees look as black as
coal. A few of t he trees have roots sticking out of the ground further
providing evidence of their ancientness. Owls whoot during the night, giving
an unwelcomed noise to those who reside in the town visible to the west.

Near a &+yLog Cabin~
   The weeds and vegetation has grown out of control and plague the footsteps
of the cabin. It is obvious that this place has somehow been deserted. The
cabin stands a little over fifteen feet tall and looks to have been constructed
well. A small chimney is visible and emits no smoke, furthering signs of
abandonment. Two small windows were built on either side of the doorway, they
are however too dirty to see through. The roof of the cabin looks to house
many of the bird life of the forest, and snakes can be heard rattling their
tails in defiance. The cabin was made of a good lumber and it's obvious from
its size that many tree's had to fall in order to build it.

In a &+yLog &nCabin~
&+y   A hard oak wood was used to make this cabin. The wood is strong enough
&+yto withstand the test of time, weathering, and an occasional monsoon.
&+yConsidering the size of the cabin, many trees must have fallen in order to
&+yprocure its existence. Little furniture exists in the room and the nature
&+yof the cabin is uncertain. It looks deserted for piles of dust cover every
&+ycorner of it. A chimney is off tin the northeastern corner of the cabin. The
&+ychimney is made of mortar, brick, and stone. It is functional despite the
&+yrefuse laying around it, although it is burnt out.

Along a &+yGame&+g Trail~
   Scattered animal prints lay on the ground marking this as a game trail of
sorts. The variety of the marks is uncanny, it is obvious that this is a well
traveled path by the animals. Sounds of animal life stir through the air. Many
of the trees are darkened from years of lack of sunlight. The trees are
however still alive. the denseness of the forest can be attributed to the
trees being so dark, since they are the only factor preventing sunlight from
reaching the earth here. The trail is very wide and it is unmarked by
conventional methods of travel such as caravans and booted footprints.

&+yA Long Winding Trail of Mud~
   Mud envelopes the path, making progress for any heavily burdened minotaur
carrying the spoils of war, slow. The muck sinks a foot deep and stretches
the entire trail, never to let up. Along the trail, on either side, the rocky
aspect of the swamp comes to life. A large amount of boulders lay scattered
about the area, they look to have been pushed for they still have leave a
crater trail from point to point. Just where these boulders were pushed to
is inapprehensible at the moment, for they are not in sight. A horrible smell
sweeps the area, the smell of mud, which resembles maneaur.

A Cobblestone Road~
   The cobblestones that make up the road below are paved and allow wagons to
freely travel without difficulty. Much of the grass on either side of the road
had grown very long, creating a type of corridor made of grass. Off toward the
north lays nothing but grass land that is put to good use by the town's
mules and farmers. A large wheat feed has a few mules and a few slaves working
the wheat. The wheat is to be served to the army when they are out of town
because wheat does not spoil and fills the tummy quite nicely. Towards the
northeast however, a forest is looms. A river within the forest runs to the
south where some sort of depot of water must reside, like open sea.

Before a&+g Forest~
   The cobblestones that make up the road are no longer visible through the
overgrown weeds and grass. The few that are visible are overturned and only
make travelling that much more difficult. It is obvious that the cows have
little concern about maintaining the roads. The sounds of forest life are
filling the air alongside the crack of a wipe from the far to the west. The
trees within the forest look very ancient and numerous. It is difficult to
look within the forest for the trees block out most of the sunlight. A few
of them are, however, uprooted and serve no other purpose than taking up space.

A Small &+yWooden Cottage~
   This cottage wouldn't exactly be called the greatest engineering marvel of
all time. It is in fact, a disaster. It looks like it's ready to collapse, what
is a miracle however is that it hasn't yet. It's only a matter of weeks before
this think collapses in upon itself. The other rooms of the cottage look
readily accessible if not for the huge minotaur blocking the way. This cow is
ready to bust someone's ass, it's best not to look him in the eye. The wood
used to create the cottage has undoubtedly come from the forest that it
borders on and it's obvious that a great deal of forest had to be cleared to
supply the necessary lumber.

A Small Plateau~
   This plateau stretches some distance before it reaches the forest to the
north east. The cobblestone road is in terrible need of restoration for the
weeds and grass have begun to overtake it, overturning stones in various spots.
There must be a minimal amount of activity this far out from town for the road
to be such a mess. A grove of some sort must reside within the forest, because
smoke arises in such a manner to suggest that it would be coming from a
chimney. The road breaks up and turns into a small trail just to the north.

&+yA Plowed Field~
   This plowed field has wheat growing in it. Minotaurs despise farming, which
is probably why they have slave labor readily available to them. Humans,
gnomes, halflings, and any other race unfortunate enough to be taken prisoner
shall work for their masters until the day they die, which might be very soon.
Before they are done with their work however, they must suffer the wrath of
their master for surviving the day. The wheat rises a five feet in the air.

&+gA Light Forest~
   A large outcropping of conipercus trees cover the area, creating a small
forest which provides shelter for several animals of the forest. The trees are
quite large however, most reaching over twenty feet tall. Their bark is an odd
color green and their branches twist themselves about like writhing serpents.
Brownish green leaves cover some of the trees, though even more are bare.
Despite the climate, these trees seem to fail to grow like the others of its
kind to the east. Perhaps some sort of poison or ghastly substance prevents
their bloom. Creatures are audible for they stir within the forest.

Beginnings of a &nCobblestone Road~
   Huge city structures are now visible. Monumental statues tower above the
buildings, roof tops can not contain giving the view. Many cow's find this
section of their settlement awe inspiring and fills them with much pride.
Merchants of many races gather here it would seem, their voices are audible
amidst the crowds trying to draw attention to themselves. The road could fit
a good number of would be merchandisers. However, there are no caravans on
the path. The road opens up to the north to a center of shopping.

A &+rMerchant's &nIntersection~
   A tremendous amount of area makes up the scenario. Huge caravans are lined
up side by side with many different merchants with their many different
valuables to trade. Everything from food to maps can be bought here. Swarms of
citizens gather to shop till they drop, pick pockets are also on the prowl.
They move in the shadows with amazing dexterity. A huge fountain lays dormant
in the center of all this, for no one cares to drink the muddy water which it
beholds. The area is quite messy with trash and equipment laying about scrapped
for junk. This are has become a depot for unwanted goods.

A Withered Cobblestone Road~
   The small cobblestones that have been laid some time ago to create this
road are paved and provide an easy traversing. Wheels glide over this section
of the town quite easily one would think. The dirt off the side of the road
and in-between the cracks of the stones would often times become airborne by
the wind during the day. It would pick up ever so slightly and collide with
a traveler or a building of some sort. The wind when it does this makes a
sharply pitched noise, an eerie noise during the night. There are no poles,
no lanterns, nor any sort of evidence that this road is difficult to travel
during the night, unaccomplished travelers need not worry. A tower looms to
the west as it rises over the trees, just high enough to be able to scope out
the surrounding area. There can be but one purpose for this tower, to peer
into the horizon for potential hostile parties.

buildings, roof tops can not contain giving the view. Many cow's find this
section of their settlement awe inspiring and fills them with much pride.
Merchants of many races gather here it would seem, their voices are audible
amidst the crowds trying to draw attention to themselves. The road could fit
a good number of would be merchandisers. However, there are no caravans on
the path. The road opens up to the south to a center of shopping. To the east
a trail takes a turn toward the forest to the north east.

&+gIn the Heart of a Swamp~
&+g   Thick masses of vines seem to create walls in several directions, making
&+gtravel in any of those ways possible. These bright green vines have a quick
&+ggrowing rate, allowing them to cover large sections of the swamp within days.
&+gThe whole surrounding area is covered with their thorny embrace, as they cling
&+gto the ground, trees, or any other obstacle that stands within their way. A few
&+gskeletal remains can be seen of those that were trapped here within those
&+gvines, though most swamp denizens either know how to navigate safely or avoid
&+gthe area all together. Thought it varies in different locations, the average
&+gheight of this vine forest seems to stretch well over eighty feet.

&+bWild Rapid~
&+b   This rapidly moving river is flowing south. One could be possibly killed
&+bif they attempted to traverse this white rapid. If the river doesn't get them
&+bthen surely the flesh eating fish surely Whatever the case, one should not
&+bstay here very long for it could prove fatal.

&+yHorses Stables~
   The horses here are well taken care of. They are groomed regularly and
never driven too hard. These horses are not war-horses, they are sometimes used
to pull caravans while on some occasions they are saddled and ridden by sole
riders. This barn that they are in isn't the most sturdy or well crafted, but
it keeps the rain off their shoulders and gives them a place to eat. The cows
have a great respect for the horse, for they are tough creatures that can crack
skulls with ease. Horses are indeed beasts of burden, which is why the cows
relate to them and care to tend to their horses.

&+yMuddy Trail in a Swamp~
&+y   This simple trail cuts a path across this mucky swamp, its muddy surface
&+yoverrun with overgrowth and muck. The swamp can be seen stretching in every
&+ydirection, with the occasional hill or stunted tree being the only thing that
&+ybreaks the misty drag landscape. Shallow pools of fetid moss covered water have
&+yformed along the trail, creating even more mud to be traversed. The distant
&+ysounds of life can be heard every so often, hoots from birds and lizards alike.
&+yDuring the night time, this swamp can be a terrible place to be left alone to
&+yone's self. It's most difficult to discern who's one's greatest enemy would be
&+yduring that time, the denizens of the swamp or their own mind.

A Muddy Clearing within the Swamp~
   A large section of thick mud has created a sort of empty clearing with only
a few hardy tuffs of swamp grass poking their way up from the ground below. No
trees grow within the clearing, though several decayed stumps are visible,
probably collected long ago by the former residents of this region. The stench
of decay and moisture hang in the air, creating a scent unpleasant to all but
those who dwell here, the reptiles and fiends of the swamp. The sun sometimes
fails to shine within this region of the swamp for many weeks on end, which is
why this swamp has not dried up just yet.

A Steep Grassy Mound~
   A massive mound juts up from the soft swamp land here, its grassy surface
warding off approaching muck from all sides. The grass here is quite hardy
and green, not the same brownish color grass from through most of these swamp
areas. It is rumored a powerful spirit of some sort lives within this hill, and
for this reason all the foul denizens of the swamp and the town abroad keep
their distance from this area. the hill itself is rather large, stretching
almost a hundred feet across and over ten feet high.

Shallow Pool of Muck~
A shallow pool has formed here, reaching about two feet deep in some
sections. A layer of grimy water above thick mud has created this dangerous
pool, making it difficult to traverse without becoming stuck. A few vines
snake their way across the pool's surface, stretching down from nearby swamp
trees. The smell in this area is quite pungent, a mixture of old moss and
earthy soil. It is difficult to discern just what manner of creature could
reside within this part of the swamp, however, whatever manner of creature it
may be, it must be a hardened and fiendish one.

Inside a &+gPatch of Tall Reeds&n~
&+g   The wet mud and pools of water have been overgrown here by thick reeds,
&+gwhich blanket the ground with their wide leaves and heavy stems. The endless
&+gdrone of buzzing insects fills the air, along with the stench of moist mud
&+gand decaying undergrowth. Deep pools of peat moss make travel dangerous their
&+gdepths threatening to engulf anyone foolish enough to stumble inside. A few
&+gstunted trees can be seen dotting the area, though for the most part the reds
&+gdominate everything in site.

On the &+yMuddy Banks&n of a &+bMossy Pool~
   The trail widens, coming to an end at the shores of a deep pool. The waters
of this pool are covered with thick moss, and its depths hidden beneath a
haze of dirt and grime. Thick brunches of reeds grow from sections of the
shore, creating excellent places for lurking beasts to hide. The muddy banks
lead straight into the water, sloping down steeply until it disappears
underneath the pool's surface. Across the pool, a huge black rock is visible.
The rock is quite large, stretching almost thirty feet high and twice as wide.
There appears to be some sort of cave leading into the black stone, though it
is hard to be sure at this distance.

On the &+bMossy Pool~
&+b   Thick layers of moss float along the surface of this pool, giving the water
&+ba greenish tint. Algae and even a few rotted branches from toppled swamp
&+btrees cover the muddy shores, sticking out at odd angles or filling spots
&+bwhere the reeds have refused to grow. The water itself is thick with dirt,
&+bmaking it impossible to determine exactly how deep the pool is. Off to the
&+beast a giant ebony boulder is visible, its giant mass creating a sort of
&+bspire which juts up from the swamp surrounding it. There appears to be a
&+bcavern entrance near the pool, though the rock vines make it difficult to be
&+bcertain, truly this is very interesting.

&+Lfetid pool of water. Reeds and a variety of mosses cover the sides of this
&+Lbank, though the path leading to the boulder to the east is made of
&+Land odd black rock, with a rough surface. Vines cling to the rock, winding
&+Ltheir way up its sides. Between two rather twisted swamp trees a cave
&+Lentrance is visible, leading deep into the rock's center.

&+LAn Unholy Church~
&+L   Pictures on the walls portray past battles of the cows versus both the
&+Lunderdark and the light dwellers. Most of them portray victory over the elves,
&+Lhumans, dwarves, and gnomes alike. the few that tell the story of battles with
&+Lthe dark dwellers show none of such victories. The pictures of the battles with
&+Lthe underdark show stalemates of sorts. Huge columns support the ceiling above
&+Land many of the columns have exquisite frescos placed around them. The icy
&+Lcold floor chills the bone during the winter, for it is made of stone. Stone
&+Lis a conduit of energy, regardless whether it is heat or cold. This place of
&+Lworship is often visited right before a battle, for the strength of their
&+Lfallen ancestors and for good luck.

&+LCenter of a Labrinth~
&+L   This large cave rises over forty feet high. Its ceiling is way out of
&+Lreach, however, its walls are not. The stone walls look to have been magically
&+Lmolded to form barriers that are all impenetrable. Nothing could conceivably
&+Lscale this walls of stone, for they themselves nearly reach the stalactite
&+Linfested ceiling. Water drips from these massive cones above. The earthly
&+Ldirt dirt is rather moisture and covered in many a bones. These bones are from
&+Lall sorts of humanoids and beasts alike, most are unidentifiable. Whatever evil
&+Ldwells within these walls must have some sort of curse laid upon them, for
&+Lwhom in their right mind's would live within this abaddon abode. Sounds echo
&+Lwithin the cavern walls quite nicely, even the slightest twitch is impossible
&+Lto go unnoticed. Sunlight could never possibly reach this underground world,
&+Ltherefore the moisture in the air is all but unbreathable. Perhaps this domain
&+Lbreeds the night dwellers of the world. In certain sections of the walls and
&+Lfloor alike lay broken armaments and various skeletons decorated in full battle
&+Lplatemail. Those poor souls who had the unfortunate ignorance to believe that
&+Lthey could conquer the evil that resides within these caverns met an untimely
&+Ldemise, despite all their strengths. These champions are of all races it seems,
&+Lfor the tall slender elven bones contrasts sharply with the short bulky dwarven
&+Lbones. Whatever evil awaits does so in complete certainty that it is safe.

Before a &+bRiver~
   Wild life can be heard nearby but they remain unseen however, for the
forestation is very thick. The trees grow an incredible height here and they
block out the sunlight that is the demise of so many nocturnal creatures. A
river is faintly visible towards the west. Many game trails are visible to the
east however, as well to the west. It is obvious that this particular section
of the forest is a hot spot amongst the animals for it provides about the
only drinking water readily available in the region. One thing the river
isn't to those who dwell in this region is safe to travel.

On a Wooden Bridge~
   The wooden bridge looks to have nearly succumbed to the elements. Years of
rain, snow, wind, and the sun look to have broken the elasticity and strength
of the bridge. A forest grove is visible just to the east, it's a very shallow
grove, however, it's impossible to see just what lays within it for a veil of
darkness surrounds it. To the south a small settlement is visible. Over the
horizon to the west a large tower looms, peaking over the trees just enough so
that it is possible to scout a large portion of the area to the east.

A &+gForest Grove~
   Sunlight will never reach this shallow grove for a curse has been laid upon
it, a curse originating from the evil tower for which resides here. No one can
say just what kind of magic is at work here or for which purpose, however, it
is clear that nothing good can become of the power at work here. The animals of
the forest avoid this alcove for this tower for their senses are tuned in with
the natural order of things and the evil tower is anything but natural. During
most of the night, wolves howl at the tower. Most minotaurs avoid this tower,
and to those who trespass only one thing could possibly be expected, death. It
is questionable whether or not the cow's were the ones who built this, for not
much is known about it. None of those who dwell within mingle with their kin.

&+Ltheir strength in magic, but on rare occasions one or two will shine through
&+Land provide a beacon for others to follow as a shining star might provide
&+Lsomeone while out at sea. Those same shining phenoms have no doubt used their
&+Lpowers to construct this tower, this enchanted place. To those unwelcome, to
&+Lthose who are not their kin, only pain awaits for intruders are not tolerated.

&+LSecond Level~
&+L   Something magical fills the air. By no means was this tower constructed
&+Lby any physical labor, no hands laid this foundation. It was construed using
&+Lthe powerful magic art that only the few possess. Minotaurs are not known for
&+Ltheir strength in magic, but on rare occasions one or two will shine through
&+Land provide a beacon for others to follow as a shining star might provide
&+Lsomeone while out at sea. Those same shining phenoms have no doubt used their
&+Lpowers to construct this tower, this enchanted place. To those unwelcome, to
&+Lthose who are not their kin, only pain awaits for intruders are not tolerated.
&+LA large open area lays to the east, with many glass display cases and a number
&+Lof items strewn about.

&+LShoppe of Lost &+MMagic~
&+L   Many glass containers behold different magical items. Potions and wands are
&+Lstored in these large class cases for safe keeping. There is no doubt that
&+Lrunes of warding and magical enchantments have been placed upon the glass to
&+Lforbid anyone from their master creator from touching them. A small fire burns
&+Lsoftly in the northeastern corner of the room. The fire crackles as it tries to
&+Lburn something that it could never possibly consume, for the fire is of magic.

&+cA Discreet Herbal Sanctuary&N~
&+c  Entering this small shop, shoppers are greeted by the scent of pungent
&+gherbs &+cand &+Yflowers&+c, which seem to fill every shelf and cupboard
&+cas well as hanging from rafters and hooks on the walls.  It appears that
&+cthe owner of this establishment has taken the time to gather up every
&+cknown type of plant for sale in his shop, and given his appearance, he's
&+cnot shy about partaking of them himself!

&+LThe Chamber of the &+RArchmage&n~
&+L   This room was created many milennia ago by practitioners of the lost art
&+Lof arcane magic. Several newly reconstructed tables lie along the wall, one
&+Lside of the room filled with magical tomes, and the other side inundated
&+Lwith alchemical elixers and potions. There is a large tapestry on the north
&+Lwall, outlining the minotaur race in its early days, when the arcane was
&+Lpurely under their control. It goes on to show their fall from grace, and
&+Lthe events in which the Gods themselves stripped away all of their magical
&+Lpotential. Finally, it goes on to visibly show an enimty between a clan of
&+Levil minotaurs, regaining the arcane gift through a dark pact with a God
&+Lof unholy stature, Zion.
