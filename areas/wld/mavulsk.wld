&n&+wBefore the&n&+L Stone Mansion~
   To the north lies the&n&+L Stone Mansion&n&+w where&n&+r Th&n&+Le Bar&n&+ron of Mav&n&+Lulsk&n
sits upon his throne.  A huge double door, made of stone blocks
the northern exit.  The building is constructed so its northern
parts are located deep inside the great mountain.  From here it
appears to be a two-floor building but one can't tell how many
floors there are inside the mountain.  Originally this was the areas
only building made by&n&+L Orc&n&+w's and&n&+r Duergar Dwarves&n&+w to defend their
mine close by.  After being abandoned for several years a tribe of
&n&+rMino&n&+Ltaurs&n&+w arrived and settled here.  The village has grown around
the mansion and is now more of a small town than a village. &n

&nInside the St&n&+Lo&n&+wne Ma&n&+Ln&n&+wsio&n&+wn&n~
   Inside the double stonedoor lies this hall with a floor is of solid
granite-stone.  The stone floor is the mountain that this hall has been
carved out from.  When the miner's first arrived here this was a cave but
they improved it as they dug further into the mountainside and made it
the entrance hall.  Now there are&n&+C mo&n&+Rsa&n&+cic&n&+w On the central Part of the floor
that continues through the exit north.  The walls are covered with carpets
with various motives and painted shields.  In both the eastern and western
wall there are wooden doors.

&+msounds associated with serious bargaining.  The market is very
&+mcrowded and it is hard to make way in the crowd through all the
&+mcustomers and merchants.  A crowd like this would be perfect for a
&+mpickpocket and one would best keep their purse and valuables hidden.
&+mTo the west lies the Central Road and to the east and north lies

   A&n&+y Tanner&n&+w works with the craftsmanship of preparing&n&+y skins. &n&+w The trade
with skins is important for the town, maybe not as important as the
farming is but close.  The smell from the liquids and chemicals used
in the process is horrible and that's the reason why their workshops
and homes are located in the outer region of the city. &n

Inside the&n&+L Gates&n&+w of&n&+r Mav&n&+Lulsk&n~
   Here inside the citygates the&n&+r Cent&n&+Lral&n&+w Street begins.  The road is
paved with granite stone and it is kept very tidy and clean by the town's
street sweepers.  Looking north one can see the great mountain behind the
city.  The traffic has increased every year since the town was founded
some 20 years ago.  Most important to the economy is the trade with metals,
farming and fur trade and related goods.  At this time of day the road is
full of merchants traveling to the market or a guild meeting.  The town
was founded by a&n&+r Mino&n&+Ltaur&n&+w tribe but now they only stand for two thirds
of the total inhabitants.  The other third is dominated by&n&+L Orcs&n&+w and
&n&+CHumans&n&+w but other races can be seen occasionally.  The Baron's policy
is freedom of religion and to discriminate no one. &n

Before the&n&+L Gates&n&+w of&n&+r Mav&n&+Lulsk&n~
  The gates through the&n&+y palisade&n&+w into the city are heavily guarded by
soldiers On the ground and guards in the&n&+r Guard&n&+yhouse&n&+w above the gates.
The gate is made of&n&+r Pine&n&+ywood&n&+w strenghten with steel and looks fairly
resistant to violence.  The choice to use a palisade instead of a stone
wall was natural since the town has been growing so fast that a stationary
stone wall only would protect a small Part of the city after a couple
of years.  Below the gates stands a couple of fierce Minotaur Guards
and&n&+L The Co&n&+wntr&n&+Loller&n&+w who sees to that no known criminals or Cave Troll
are let inside.  Every since the Minotaur town was founded some 20-years
ago they've had trouble with a clan of Cave Trolls.

   This small hallway has its walls covered with pinewood and the floor
with a thick red carpet.  A small door is placed On the eastern wall.  Loud

or even practice for battle, and together with the tasty smell there must
be a kitchen somewhere north.

&+rThat any creature can live here longer than a breath is quite amazing.  The

&+ris a huge magma gate, this is one of the seven gates to hell.  A throne made
