&+BLake of Steam~
  The lake of Steam, so named for the wisps of fog that perpetually cover the
surface, rising up to a few feet or more. The waters appear calm, never
revealing the source of the fog which hides it secrets. An occasional ship, off
in the distance is all that ever breaks the serenity. A channel lies to the
south, eventually leading to the great shining sea.

  This dirt pathway, although optimistically referred to as a 'highway', is
nothing more than a shortcut for daring merchants and bold travellars wishing
passage between the borders of Calimshan and the Shaar. A few ruts suggest
occasional use, but it is well known to be a dangerous route indeed.

  The current of the great channel is less swift here, for some reason or

by small boat or other such craft. The rest of the channel is far to dangerous

&+BThe Shining Sea Channel~
  This section of the channel is near the eastern bank, insight of a small dock.
To the south lies the great Shining Sea, while the Lake of Steam lies north. A
small island to the south, in the center of the channel, houses a tall
lighthouse. This channel is apparently an important route for trade.

&+yDocks on the &+BSea Channel~
  A small, but stout wooden dock juts a few feet out here, into a great channel.
North, lies the fog enshrouded Lake of Steam, and the Shining Sea dominates the
south. A small island in the center of the channel, slightly to the southwest
of here, houses a tall lighthouse.

&+yA Dusty Highway~
  This dirt pathway, although optimistically referred to as a 'highway', is
nothing more than a shortcut for daring merchants and bold travellars wishing
passage between the borders of Calimshan and the Shaar. A few ruts suggest
occasional use, but it is well known to be a dangerous route indeed.

&+LEdge of the Mountain~
  A few large rocks are all that is available for standing. North, a large
mountain chain begins, rising steeply. Slightly west, one may climb down to
where the southern coastal highway begins to enter the pass, but it would be
much easier to just step south, where the road is level with your position.
East, the rocks form a small, sheltered alcove.

mountains provide little in the way of help. A steep 45 degree angle is the
best that would be had.

&+BThe Shining Sea Channel~
  This section of the channel is along the western bank, south of a small dock.
To the south lies the great Shining Sea, while the Lake of Steam lies north. A
small island to the northeast, in the center of the channel, houses a tall
lighthouse. This channel is apparently an important route for trade.

&+gSmall Island~
  This small island is comprised mainly of volcanic rock. It sits almost
dead center of the channel, halfway between the Lake of Steam, and the Shining
Sea. In the center of the island, a lighthouse stands, its strong beam piercing
both the endless fogs of the lake, and the eternity of water that is the ocean
to the south.

&+gGrassy Hills at the Edge of the Mountain~
  The road has been climbing this hill for a time now, but gently enough to
not feel. It now slopes steeply to the south, as it begins to head for sea
level, before it reaches the Shining Sea. Looking west, you can see endless
reaches of rolling fields and hills, following along the southern coast of
Duris. East, the mountain begins its ascension, and quickly enough to
prevent climbing.

  It's not quite clear whether or not this was a waystation, or merely a place
for the roadcrew to park their heads at night. A few cobwebs in the corners are
all that remain of this small, square room. The door, however, appears stout
enough to provide an evenings safety.

lighthouse. The rocks begin to rise, as the waters enter the channel, yet do
not seem to hinder docking.

nothing more than a shortcut for daring merchants and bold travellars wishing

it is perfectly smooth in nature. A mere span wide and a span-and-a-half high,
one must tread carefully to navigate.

&+LOpening into the Side of the Mountain~
  The rocks rise steep here, preventing further passage along the top of the
mountain. A small, half hidden opening leads west, into the darkness of the
underground. North, through a flat area of grass, a trail cuts, appearing to
lead right towards the northern edge.

It appears one may climb down towards the plains without too much problem.

extend right up to the forest of Mir, which seems to gain its sustenance

  The ridge ends here, cut off by the force of the waterfall to the north.
The only safe route seems to be back south, along the western edge of the
mountain. Looking out, one can see reaches of grassy plains, leading to the
forest of Mir. Across this, a small river with steep banks cuts.

&+LA Crack in the Mountain~
  This crack inside the mountain leads both up and down. It is not large
enough for two to pass, but is comfortable enough for one. Handholds are few,
making this a dangerous route to be climbing. A slight hint of light is above.

&+LA Slight Ridge~
  The crack has opened up here, as the lower section juts out two feet past
the top, forming a slight ridge. It continues, twisting and turning a bit, to
the north and the south. West, the mountains side rises steeply, all the way
to the top. East, one has a nice view of the Lake of Steam, far below, its
surface covered in wisps of fog.

&+LAn Ancient Chamber of Unknown Use~
  The tunnel opens into a slight chamber, almost round, and with a ceiling that
curves as it reaches higher into a central pinnacle, almost 5 spans above. In
the center of the chamber, a large statue dominates. The walls are paneled in
the same Mirwood as the passage, but appear to be in much better shape. Almost
as if time has forgotten this place, and nature has been banned from entering.
The floor is smooth, and tiled in slabs of purest marble, the variety of which
has only been seen from the Spine of the World mountain range.

seem to agree on the finer points, nor has its origin ever been hinted at,
but all of the tales agree on one thing; it is an artifact of great power.

Although slightly damaged from the almost 100% humidity in here, the panels
appear quite beautiful, as if lovingly placed by master craftsman. The
ceiling is a bit high, almost two spans above, suggesting the former users
of this place were a tall breed.

  Off the main passageway to the north, lies this enlarged section. It has
been heavily worked, probably by the orcs slaves, to become a large room with
alcoves suitable for all types of storage. It is perhaps five spans by three,
with the ceiling a lofty four spans above.

&+LSharp Turn in the Passageway~
  The passage is large enough for two abreast, and by the looks of the prints
in the sandy floor, is used as such quite often. It continues both north and
east.

&+LDark Passage Inside the Mountain~
  This semi-worked passagway, continues north and west. The ground is of rock,
but smooth, the walls containing no dangerously sharp outcroppings. It is
small, but still has room enough for two abreast. Numerous scuff marks on the
ground suggest many leather boots have passed this way before.

&+yA Dusty Highway~
   The wagon tracks are distinct as they plow through the unearthed dirt path.
Long grass grows on either side of the road. Beautiful light-green hills and
valleys cover the landscape. Sometimes, a small billygoat or duck would cross
the pathway. The hills seem to go on forever to the north and south. To the
east and west, the highway continues. A &+Wsign&N is stuck in the road here.

   The hills here span the entire northern and western range. They are very
steep and dangerous. Small green hills compliment the tall ones, almost making
the hills look like steps to the sky for a giant. There are no breezes here
mainly because of the hills blocking any avenue for a gust of wind to travel.
The hills are barren of any trees-- but they are covered with shrubs and
grass. The only access to other hills are to the east and south.

&+WHigh Hills~
   The hills here span the entire western range. They are very steep and
dangerous. Small green hills compliment the tall ones, almost making the hills
look like steps to the sky for a giant. There are no breezes here mainly
because of the hills blocking any avenue for a gust of wind to travel. The
hills are barren of any trees-- but they are covered with shrubs and grass.
The only access to other hills are to the north, south, and east. The Holy Path
is south.

   This truly is an inspirational spot. The floor rises about 5 feet off of the
ground. One has to use stairs to get behind the cypress podium sitting behind
an altar. On the golden altar is a white cloth and on top of this cloth is a
red, circular cloth. A cross hangs from the altar, and a large cross hangs on
the wall behind the podium. The church has been made for this spot-- any words
spoken from here would echo throughout. There is a spiral staircase leading up
behind the podium. A door is to the east. Two clergy rooms are north and south.

   Many bells hang in this room, poised and ready to sound the chimes upon the
hour. Anyone in these towers at that time would surely damage their hearing.
Long ropes hang from the bells. Clock gears are intricately moving in several
directions. A black long-hand and short-hand move across the face of the church
clock. From this vantage point, one can see the inside of the clock, ticking
away. A large, white piece of metal hangs from the gears and swings back and
forth continuously, like a pendulum. The whole top portion of the belfry is
open. The view is of the northern hills. Far off to the north, the River Krent
leaves a silvery trail. There is a spiral staircase leading down from the
tower.

&+WSteps to Heaven~
   The bridge, at first, is completely flat. The gateway to the south is at
least 100 feet higher than the bridge. It seems impossible that it could reach
the door to the entryway. However, with each step made on the bridge, the stair
seems to magically raise one level upwards. Each step, when touched, rises in
succession to the other, till finally, the bridge reaches the entrance to the
palace. The bridge is laden in silver and sparkles brightly in the sunlight. It
is a wonderful sight to behold. At the entry to the bridge a &+Wsign&N hangs on
a post. To the south are the palace gates, which are made of pure silver,
glowing in a bright white.

   This balcony has no floor underneath. However, one may just magically float
here above the clouds as the gods do. The floor is remarkably solid. The walls
are solid stone but only come up to one's waist. Gold railings surround the
balcony. Vines wrap themself around the railings and hang over the edge of the

   The entire room glows a bright white. The light fills the room-- almost
blinding any occupants. Large, white, pillars line the entryway and are beveled
with jewels and gems. The ceiling is made of glass, allowing a view of the blue
sky and clouds above. A white-blue carpet leads the way into the palace.
Glorious statues of angels and cherubs listlessly hang above tall pillars,
looking down upon anyone walking along the path. To the east and west are small
balconies that do not have any floor!

   This hallway is lined with many statues of those who were once great kings
of Volheru. Each statue depicts a king doing a certain action. In this part of
the hallway, a king is shown sitting in his chair brooding over something
important-- probably a siege or war. On the other side of the hallway is a
statue of a king lifting his sword for battle, his shield clutched between
his arms. The statues are made of marble, but somehow, glitter with a bright
light. The hallway continues north and south.

stone coffin propped on a set of stairs glows brightly. The inscription on the
coffin reads "King Viznor". The coffin top has been pried open by someone.

To Whomever It May Concern:

   My name is Morlanthra. I was once a great magician in service to His
Highness, Mrotha, Ruler of Volheru. I have used up all of my powers just
to get this note to you in an effort to help me escape from these caverns. My
daughter, Esterra, a very powerful sorceress, has always hated me because she
blames me for her mother's death-- a death that occurred because I applied a
magical incision during the birth of Esterra trying to save both her and her
mother from further complications, but of which was a failure resulting in her
mother's demise. I have tried to explain this to Esterra, but to no avail. She
has cursed me, and has, with the help of her lover, Sir Morley, imprisoned me
in this enchanted cave. I have not seen the light of day for many years now
and count the days of my exit from this foul trap. You will be heavily
rewarded if you release me; this, I promise.

Oh...watch out for Esterra's right-hand sorceress and
apprentice, Nynevena. Do not underestimate her.

Morlanthra the Great.

   Keep a closer eye on Morlanthra. I have felt some sort of

   This must be the cavern where all the water empties into from the waterfall.
A heavy mist hangs over the cavern, making it very stuffy and hard to breathe.
The pond feels like slush under the feet, and several bones and skeletons are
sitting upright in the mire. In the center of the pond grows a large tree-- or
is it a dead tree? One cannot tell. Carved into the trunk is a door, with
an odd key hole in the shape of a tree.

                      Cornwelsh, who traveled these
                      swamps in search of the Kearonor
                      Beast. This brave knight was never
                      seen again.

&+yThe Swamp of Cornwelsh~
   The area is damp and moist. Dark-green and light-brown muck squishes
underfoot. Flies and gnats hover over the stench and mud that covers this
landscape. Vines and leaf-less trees seem to have persevered the cold and damp
fogs that hang overhead. Eyes, peering out of the dark, stare at any travelers
lurking about. There is a feeling that danger and death lies around the corner
of this god-forsaken swamp.

   The fog is at its thickest in this area. One is not able to see one's feet
in such a dense haze. The air is hard to breathe, and the moisture is
intolerable. Creatures do serpentines through the muck, apparently, unaware or
undaunted by the darkness that exists here. Trees are barely visible to the
north and east.

&+RHome of the Kearonor Beast~
   The mist clears somewhat, but not completely. No animals or creatures seem
to be moving here-- in fact, there are none to be found. A suit of armor that
was once worn on a knight is stuck in the black mud and slush. Human bones,
femurs, skulls, and spines are sticking out of the swamp, and have been
scattered about. The smell is awful. It reeks of dead, rotting flesh. There is
also the smell of sulphur and acid surrounding the mire. The only exit, which
should probably be taken quickly, is south.

   The wagon tracks are distinct as they plow through the unearthed dirt path.
Long grass grows on either side of the road. Beautiful light-green hills and

east and west, the highway continues. A &+Wsign&N is stuck in the road here.

&+WHigh Hills~
   The hills here span the entire southern, eastern and western range. They are
very steep and dangerous. Small green hills compliment the tall ones, almost
making the hills look like steps to the sky for a giant. There are no breezes
here mainly because of the hills blocking any avenue for a gust of wind to
travel. The hills are barren of any trees-- but they are covered with shrubs
and grass. The only access to other hills is to the north. To the southwest,
beyond the hills, is a church. The steeple stands high above the hills.

musty with cobwebs and food gone rotten. Several old linens and rags lie on the
ground. This room looks as though it was condemned many years ago.

&+WKnight Mountain~
   High cliffs make this a very dangerous climb; but there are several
footholds that make it possible. On the ridge of this mountain, a polearm has
been inserted into a hole in the granite wall of a precipice. On the polearm,
a red flag flaps in the wind. Some sheep and mountain goats are grazing on the
ledges. They must have been very agile to get up this high. At the bottom of
the mountain, several skeletons dressed in knights' uniforms lie on the ground.
Dried blood covers some of the footholds. No doubt, many a knight has tried
this climb, but to no avail. The only direction is up from here-- or to wisely
head back to the plains.

   The cliffs here are dangerously high; however, there are stairs carved into
the stone up to this point, and to the west. The view here is breathtaking,
showing vast plains and Castle Brunmoor to the southeast. Tumbling hills cover
the western regions of Volheru, and a forest covers the southwest. The wind
tunnels through like a cold reminder of Winter.

&+WOn the Cliffs~
   This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. The footholds feel shaky and loose. Several
loose rocks plunge downward with every step. A cold wind from the east hits the
mountain with alacrity. Careful stepping is highly recommended here. Any sudden
jolt or movement could lead one to join the skeletons below. Small roots and
plants grow out of the cracks of the mountain, enabling one to use his or her
hands to hold on them for security. One may travel up or down from here.
Preferably, down!

&+WPathway Between Mountains~
   The mountain has leveled off here (thank goodness!). Two high cliffs on the
east and west jut out of the solid rock underneath. A small pathway between
them used to lead north, yet now is barred by rocky rubble. The wind from the
east has now changed course, coming from the south into the gap between these
two mountains. These mountains are bare of any plant life. The top of some of
the mountains beyond the cliffs are snowcapped. Indeed, the air here does feel
chilly and it is hard to breathe.

   The beauty of the land is breathtaking. Green rolling hills abound. The
scent of flowers that have begun their bloom is carried on a light breeze. A
small dirt pathway, the Golden Merchant Trade Route, carves its way through
the hills here, into a dense fog north, beyond the hills. A &+Wsign&N post is
stuck in the ground here, slightly flapping to the undulating breeze.

&+WThief Camp~
   There is a camp of thieves and rogues here. Tents are mounted, and a fire is
burning with a pig roasting over it. Several bows and arrows are lying around.
A large wooden table is next to one of the tents. Several wooden plates and
knives lie scattered on the table. It looks as though outsiders were not meant
to disturb this area.

granite. There are small divots in the side-- small enough to fit one's feet

mountains further off in that direction are snowcapped and steep.

   The view is breathtaking. Green, lush, valleys cover the landscape below. To
the far east, a forest adds a dark-green luster to the view. Northwest, there
is a small town surrounded by a wooden wall. Far off to the east past the
forest is a castle in its splendor. Fog has settled over some of the turrets
which have red flags waving in the wind.  The air is chilly up here. Winds
tunnel through this gap in the mountain and treat it as a funnel. To the north,
south, and west, there is flat ground to travel on.

   There are several lit torches hanging on the wall. A round table is in the
center of the room with a statue sitting on it. The statue looks as though it
were built out of black onyx or flint. It depicts a knight on a beautiful black
stallion, his sword waving in the air. The stallion looks as though it is ready
for battle, it's hooves are poised that way. On the armor of the knight, there
is a symbol-- probably his family crest. The sword he carries is dark-black,
and it glows a dark-blue. There is a secret door to the east leading back out
to the mountains. Another exit is to the west.

&+GShrubbery~
   There are just bushes and shrubbery in this spot. This looks to be a good
area to use to ambush the innocent merchant travelling the Golden Merchant
Trade Route. Any wagons would be unwary of the danger that might lurk behind
these bushes, especially when the shrubbery and bushes provide the perfect
tactical waiting spot for any thief.

&+yA Dusty Highway&n~
   A small pathway leads north. The dense fog to the south seems strange. It
only covers one plot of land, about a square mile. The land has begun to
flatten more. Bushes and shrubbery line both sides of the pathway. The pathway
has been used quite a bit. Foot prints and wagon tracks are everywhere.

&+yBeginning of a Dusty Highway&n~
&+y   A small pathway leads to the north and south from here. While it is possible
&+yto notice that is turns east in quite a short distance to the north, the dense
&+yfog to the south blocks any further view. It only covers one plot of land,
&+yabout a square mile. The land has begun to flatten more. Bushes and shrubbery
&+yline both sides of the pathway. The pathway has been used quite a bit.
&+yFoot prints and wagon tracks are everywhere.

&+yA Large Harpy Nest&n~
   &+yPerched at the edge of a mountain cliff, this large nest is&n
&+ythe home to a large family of harpies.  The cozy nest is large&n
&+yenough to accomodate atleast six full grown harpies, and has room&n
&+yfor treasures which are half seen in the tucks of the straw. A plump&n
&+yseems to be protecting something under her wing against any intruders.&n
