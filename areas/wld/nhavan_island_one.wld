Narrow Strip of Land~
   The little strip of land bends to the east and the south here. Sparse weeds
are the only things growing on the volcanic rock. Waves lap gently at the sides
of the strip.

Tip of the Strip of Land~
   The cooled black rock of the ancient volcano supports no life. Little
puddles of water, however, do contain small shellfish washed ashore by the
action of the water. To the east, one of the larger islands comprising the
Moonshaes can be seen a mere hundred yards away.

It is carved from a native wood to resemble a squat Endu, but its face is in
a perpetual scowl and its hair is of stylized flame. Small offerings of fish,
incense, and brightly-colored flowers surround the idol.

   This aged, dilapidated ship long ago brought the Endu here from their

their witch doctor has promised times of plenty as long as they continue the
ship's upkeep.
