&+LA Large &+gSlimy &+LGate~
&+G   Large iron poles covered in rust and slime creak on their hinges as the
&+Gwind slowly blows them from side to side.  The gate rises well above ten feet,
&+Gand the adjoining stone wall is just as high.  Some mist sweeps the ground and
&+Gpours from the inside of the gates, it forbids anyone from ascertaining just
&+Gwhat they're stepping on.  The ground feels exactly like the stone walls look
&+Glike however, for the walls are covered in slime, vines, and an array of plant
&+Gvegetation.  There is no sun in the sky, there are no birds chirping, and there
&+Gare no living beings within sight.  The air is saturated with water, making
&+Gbreathing an arduous task.

&+gDiverging Aviations~
&+L   A stone wall to the north forbids travel anywhere but east and west.  The
&+Lwall might be possible to climb, however, it is nearly twelve feet high and
&+Lcovered in many a vine and alot of slimy vegetation.  Some green mist covers
&+Lthe ground.  Small boulders and stone rocks are visible from many a collaspe
&+Lin the wall, they are the only thing viewable upon the ground.  The clouds
&+Lblock out all of the sunlight from above, however, this darkness seems magical
&+Lfor the nightsky stretches over the distance, pass the horizon in every
&+Ldirection.  Reptilian and amphibian life fill the air with their croaks and
&+Lcreeks.

&+gA Turn in a Corridor~
&+L   The mist is very thick and appears to be flowing in from the north.  The
&+Lclouds block out the sunlight during the daytime, however, it's in question
&+Lwhether or not the sun eve shines within these walls.  Perhaps the darkness
&+Lis really magical in nature, or perhaps it's something like a curse that
&+Lengulfs everything within these walls.  All curses have been cast by a mortal
&+Lbeing, so maybe evicerating this wizard could dispell the curse.  Croaks and
&+Lother noises from the creatures that dwell here fill the night air.

&+gA Winding Aviation~
&+L   This long corridor stetches a vast distance it appears.  Such a vast
&+Ldistance that it would take many months to effectively sojourn it.  Perhaps
&+Lthis is a magical illusion.  Maybe the magical darkness that covers the
&+Lland attests to this.  The walls, however, seem to be taking the test of time,
&+Land losing miserably because in many spots on either side of the path the walls
&+Lare succumbing to the elements.  The moisture in the air could be the cause
&+Lof such weathering.  Green mist covers the ground and swirls around footsteps.

&+L   A small pond in the center of the circular corridor.  Slime and algae cover
&+Lmost of it, vines and plant life also cover a huge chunk of it.  Many reptiles
&+Land amphibious creature wander in and out of it.  The mist seems to originate
&+Lfrom this eerie pond, and it is not a magical mist.  The mist swirls from the
&+Lcenter of the pond outward, as if it had formed in its depths and is now
&+Lreleasing itself upon this domain.  The darkness too that covers this land must
&+Ltoo be magical.  An pair of abaddon trees to the north greet any passerbyer
&+Lwho decides to follow along the corridor northward.  However, the pond seems
&+Lto be beckoning one and all to it.

&+LA &nDungeon &+LChamber~
   Everything from pits and pendelums to firepits partake in torture in this
chamber.   It's well suited for inflicting pain upon others.  One particular
torture device has four ropes attached to a steam driven retracter, it's
obvious intent is simple, to rips one's limbs off.  Other more direct methods
of torture are also present.  However, the chamber itself was construed using
a cold stone.  There are many different levels within this chamber, however,
iron doors to the north and a large brooding entrance to the south are the only
means of exiting.

with many different designs embedded in it.  Some of the designs are truely

handle with a similarly large keyhole flank the left side of the gate.  Most
of sections of the walls seem to be unaffected by the weathering of time,
truely this door must have an enchantment upon it.  Breaking through this door
could prove hazardous to one's health.

   The grass grows as tall as a persons waist.  The game trail is obvious to
a fairly skilled woodsman.  The trails are however, quite unrecognizable.  It's
obvious that animal have come through this region recently, but just what they
are is a mystery.  Off over the horizon a small mountain is visible.  The
mountain acts like a fork in a road for it separates two distinct areas of the
woodlands.  Strange noises fill the air, noises resembling that of cheetas and
cats.  A forest opens up to the north and a large cavern shaped structure to

&+gthe underbrush not many other plants reside here.  Dead leaves from past
&+gautumns cover the ground.  The cloud cover isn't too vast, and a sunburst is
&+geminant.

&+LA Dense F&+gor&+Gest~
&+g   It would be impossible to move any large scale weapons like ballistas or any
&+gcaravans.  Horses alone would have a hard time sojourning this heavily dense
&+gforest.  Huge trees rocket toward the sky, their roots having been firmly
&+gplanted for centuries.  Nearly all of the trees are like this, and aside from
&+gthe underbrush not many other plants reside here.  Dead leaves from past

&+LA Large &+GAclo&+gve~
&+G   This part of the forest gives way for the wolfen majority.  Their powerful
&+Gbodies have managed to build a large nest.  This abode of theirs has served as
&+Ga nesting and feeding ground for many eyars.  Most of the vegetation, tree,
&+Gand assorted plant life have been mauled over to give way to some living space.
&+GLittle baby cubs hide in their nest awaiting for their nuturing parents.  Odd
&+Gnoises populate the air, perhaps they are war cries.

&+WA Clearing~
&+g   This forest begins to wither and gives way to a grassland.  The roots of the
&+gtrees stick out from under the ground.  It's been centuries since they firt
&+glaid their roots and perhaps they merely want to stretch their limber.  Oddly,
&+gnot many game are visible, however, their trails are obvious to detect.
&+gCertain disformations of the grass and dirt trails are numerous.  Off in the
&+gdistance, over the horize, a large keep is visible.  However, to get to this
&+gcastle one must cross hazardous terrain.

&nBefore a &+yBridge~
   The bridge is made of planks and rope.  The planks are tied on to the rope,
and are stretched length wise to give something to walk on.  The rope is used
to provide a crude hand rail and it gives lift to the planks.  A huge ravine
below the bridge is full of plant life.  A fresh water lake gives life to the
creatures in this region, its source is the mountain to the west.  Getting
across the bridge could prove hazardous, for if the wind picks up at any
given moment while trying to cross, it could make you fall.

&+WOn a Rope &+yBridge~
&+W   The bridge sways gently in the wind.  Luckily, the wind is nothing more than
&+Wa slight breeze.  The planks seem sturdy and adequate to handle a large amount
&+Wof weight.  With the ropes at shoulder height, it makes for something good to
&+Whold on to.  The ravine below is nearly two hundred feet deep, a fall from here
&+Wwould be fatal.  Off in the distance a castle is visible, and on either end of
&+Wthe bridge, a flatland.

&+YMountain Edge Near a Forest~
&+y   The mountain adjoins with the adjacent forest.  Rocks and hills replace
&+yhard stones and ledges.  Grass and forest life replace the baron mountain
&+yrange.  The forestation is light, however, and many animals and birds can be
&+yheard rumaging through the forest.  The cloud cover partitions the sky and
&+ya cloud burst streaks from the heavens.  The hill runs on an upward slope to
&+ythe west towards the baron mountainside.

&+YA Steep Cliff~
&+y   The steep cliff rises to a plateau above.  The climb is a treacherous one,
&+yhowever, it is the only means of reaching the keep above.  The strange keep
&+yis visible from this vantage point, its gargantuan size could never be missed.
&+yThe sharply edged rocks and the overall loose footing is probably why there are
&+yhumanoid bones laying at the base of the climb.  Obviously, those are the
&+yremains of failed attempts of scaling it.

&+YA Treacherous Cliff~
&+Y   A huge keep is visible from here.  What's amazing is that the keep was
&+Ycarved from the mountainside.  It is totally one with the mountain.  Not only
&+Ydoes this give the keep a formidable defense, but it literally awes anyone who
&+Ycatches a glimspe at it, striking fear and doubt into their heart.  The plateau
&+Yhas been cleared of any of the former trees that once took up most of this
&+Yregion.  Those same trees belonged to the forest to the east.  Small pebbles
&+Ymake for loose and easy footing.  Whatever has created this place must sure
&+Ypossess some strong magic.

&+YBefore a Huge Keep~
&+Y   A large stone keep looms to the north.  It's massive gates seem to have no
&+Yhindges, however, gates must be able to open and close so there they must be
&+Yelusive to the eye.  Huge parapets have no guards posted on them for some
&+Ystrange reason.  There are no signs of life within the city, no music, no
&+Ysmoke, and no livestock.  It's as if the keep is abandoned, or purposely kept
&+Ybaron and isolated from the world.

&+LA Massive &+YCircular Chamber~
&+L   This large domed chamber is something of a mystery.  There are no visible
&+Lexits besides the massive gate to the south.  It's a small wonder why anyone
&+Lwould want to design a castle in this manner.  Runes along the walls and
&+Lceilings speak the language of magic, however, a magic so incomprehensive it's
&+Limpossible to dicipher.  Truely, this keep is a relic of the past, a place
&+Lwhere potent magic still existed.

&+LBefore a &+WGreat Castle~
&+W   A large castle made of a white porcelain stone is to the west.  This great
&+Wstructure must have taken decades to build.  It's great iron portcullis
&+Wforbids foes from gaining direct access.  Along the hindges of the castle,
&+Wgrass and trees grow unopposed.  In some sections of this forest, some branches
&+Wfrom the trees actually touch the parapets.  Maintenance is required from
&+Wtime to time to ensure the the integrity of the castle is not compromised.

&+GThe Castle's &+gRoyal&+G Garden&n~
&+g   This area is within the royal garden of the Castle.  The garden is
&+gsurrounded on every side by either a huge stone wall or a castle structore.
&+gTo the north there is a l arge tower and to the west a large library.  The
&+ggarden is a combination of lush lawn shrubs and trees of all shapes and
&+gsizes.  this is certainly a place where someone could always find a nice quiet
&+gplace to just sit and ponder life.

&+WA Tower Base~
&+W   This tower is on the north side of the castle.  It gives an excellent view
&+Wof the region to the north and allows for any threat to be detected days before
&+Warrival.  The river to the east of the castle can be seen to the horizon
&+Wenabling any threat by water to also be detected.  To the soutwest lies the
&+Wlarge library which is visible from this tower also.  The tower itself is
&+Wconstructed of large brick stones and has a weathered, thatch trapdoor above.
&+WAll of the side walls have slits in them which enable look outs in a relatively
&+Wsafe way.

&+WA Magical Library~
&+W   This large library is the beholder of millions of secrets.  Endless shelves
&+Wof books stretch through most of the room.  They're lined up horizontally and
&+Wrun from east to west.  It seems as though there are no ends to any of the
&+Wbookshelves.  A large woven carpet in the center of the room has an intricate
&+Wdesign strewn in it, a design of a large carrion bird.  The bookshelves rise
&+Wa daunting twenty feet in the air, and there are no ladders within sigit.  One
&+Wmust use magical means to summon the books, else they must scale the shelves
&+Wthemselves.

&+Wupon it lays in the far northern corner next to a fireplace.  The walls are
&+Wmade of a fine marble, very smooth and warm to the touch.  Many runes are
&+Wvisible upon the walls, ceiling, and floor alike.  These runes must have
&+Wsomething to do with preservation and warding to some extent.  Many bodies
&+Wcan fit into this layer, despite its small demeanor.

&+LA &+gSlimy&+L Path~
&+G   This small trail is covered in much refuse and slime.  It would appear that
&+Gthis road hasn't seen the rays of day in many years because dew has formed
&+Gupon the plants and accumulated over the years to form small ponds.  Off the
&+Gtrail resides a swampland.  Above, where the nightsky should be, there is
&+Gnothing but darkness.  No moonlight, no clouds, just pitch black.  Maybe a
&+Gcurse has been laid upon this place, awaiting to be broken.  Up ahead to the
&+Gnorth, a gate can be seen.  It's a large iron poled gate with some green mist
&+Gfloating out from the inside.
