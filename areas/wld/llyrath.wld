&+yOn a Dirt Road&n~
   This trail is small, but well-traveled for its size. Small stones line
the path and the area seems pleasant and quiet. A large forest can be seen
along the southern horizon, expanding east and west. To the north a large
road lies.

   Here, the dirt road narrows into a large path, dwindling slowly to
the south, leading into a large forest. The plantlife is sparse, with
mostly just different types of grasses covering the rocky ground.

&+GOutside Llyrath Forest&n~
   The magestic trees of Llyrath forest tower above, shadowing all of
the ground beneath with their limbs and leaves. Most of the trees are
of a deciduous nature. To the south one can see a light pathway leading
deeper into the forest. To the north is the beginning of a path leading
away from the forest, onto a rocky plain.

you get to a body of water that lies to the southwest. A natural path
leads to the shores of the lagoon which are a deep blue, suggesting that
it is very deep indeed. To the north a small worn trail can be seen making

   Outside of the trees one can see the beginning of a small hilly
area to the south, running along the southern edge of the forest. A
small waterfall splashes down from a cliffside into the lagoon. The
lagoon itself is in the shape of a semi-circle with a rocky shore.
To the northwest an outlet can be seen, travelling its way through
the dense forest. Dense trees surround the lagoon, standing about
30 feet from the shore. The only opening in the trees by land can
be seen in the northeastern section of the clearing.

&+COn an &+BOutlet &+Cfrom a &+BLagoon&n~
   The small river that runs from the lagoon, to the south, is fairly
deep, and moves at a slow rate, gently rolling by on its rocky bed.
Shoreline surrounds each side of the outlet before it enters the dense
forest, at which time it is surround by thick clusters of trees to the
north. A large hill is to the south, with a rocky cliffside on the
southside, over which a small waterfall falls, having traveled over
the hilly range that the single hill is just a part of.

   The waters fo the lagoon are shallow here, enough to wade and swim in
without much danger of drowning or sinking. The rocky shore is very close
by, also offering safety within an easy grasp. Further into the lagoon
though the water suddenly becomes very deep, as can be seen by the much
darker water. One would be wise not to travel far away from the shore
without knowing how to swim, or having something to keep them afloat.

   Dark water below with the spray of the waterfall gently falling over
the surface, this place is serene and beautiful to gaze upon. The stone
of the cliffside over which the water falls is of a brown colored rock,
almost like a hardened clay. The area the water falls over has been
worn smooth by erosion, and the lagoon made deep by the force of it
all. The shore surround the water in a semi-circle against the side
of the cliff, rocky, yet not too rugged. Thirty feet from the shore
are the dense trees of Llyrath forest. Two breaks in the trees can be
seen, one to the northeast, and one to the northwest. The outlet
of this lagoon flows out of the northwestern opening.

&+yInside a Small Shack&n~
   Made form the wood of the forest with semi-expert skill, this shack
is able to shelter any from the weather moderately. A small table and
chair are in the center of the single roomed shack, and a bed is in the
corner, covered with animal furs. The door to the shack is to the east.

&+gIn a &+LSecluded &+gGrove&n~
   This small secluded grove is circular in shape and has well tended to
grounds. The trees branches all interweave, blocking off any exit except
to the east. In the center of the grove is a small pool, crystal clear
and in the shape of a circle as well.

&+gIn a Small &+yGully&n~
   This sinkhole was probably made by some underground force. An opening
in one side of the sinkhole leads into a natural formed cave which leads
down into the underground. The rivers path inevitably leads there, going
underground.

&+LInside a Small Cave&n~
   &+yThis naturally formed cave is small, but large enough to fit a group
&+yof people. A small river flows through here from the south and into the
&+ywall of the cave to the north. The rock is brown and rugged, and to the
&+ysides of the river are soft clay floors. The river dominates the entrance
&+yto the cave, making it one way. An onyx pillar is in the center of the
&+yroom, from the middle of the river to the ceiling of this cave.
