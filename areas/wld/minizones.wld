&+LAt a Mammoth Rock~
&+g   The trail halts quite abruptly at a mammoth boulder
&+ghere, standing twenty feet high and fifteen feet around in
&+gdiameter. The rock is formed into a sharp point, and looks
&+gas though it was once carved into that shape, though time
&+gand age have smoothed its features. The mammoth stone seems
&+gvery out of place here, and was probably carved thousands
&+gof years ago, long before this forest came about. The trail
&+gbends east around the rock, while continuing to the north.

&+gthough not much detail can be made out from this distance.

&+gThis area seems to be devoid of creatures, and the faint
&+gremains of the trail meander off to the north, where you can
&+gbarely make out what seems to be a large castle.

&+ginto the form of a rectangle, with sharp edges cut to

&+gcarved near the bottom of one side. It looks very eerie in

&+w   This cozy wayhouse is darn right country in decorations,
&+wwith a grand piano, long bar, and a dozen or so round
&+wtables for relaxing at. The bar as well as the liquor
&+wcabinet behind it are made from solid oak, and the long
&+wcabinet has a large piece of stained glass set into its
&+wcenter. The glass has printed at its center, in large
&+wswirling letters, "Jenna's Wayhouse". The smells of lamp
&+woil and women's perfume fill the air, mixing in with the
&+wsmoke coming from the fireplace on the east wall. The room
&+wcontinues south, where it looks like meals are served, and

&+wbuilding with a doorway to the east that is about ten feet
&+whigh and looks very much like an outhouse. To augment the
&+wpoint, a horrible smell fills the air in the area, that of
&+wfeces and urine. Not very surprisingly, it looks as though

&+wleading out east into the yard. From the well kept nature

&+windicate that this place must get a lot of use. East of
&+where, the corral runs around the back of the wayhouse,
&+wallowing for a large enough area to ride the horses in.

&+RInside the Horse Barn~
&+w   This part of the horse barn holds about twenty different
&+wstalls, each of which large enough to hold a warhorse sized
&+wmount. The floor of the barn and stalls here is covered
&+wwith about an inch of hay, with dirt underneath. The air
&+wis filled with the pungent smells of horse manure and hay,
&+wthough not too much so as to make it uncomfortable. The
&+wbarn continues to the north and opens into a corral to the

&+Lto be a fairly well as travellers go weary of traveling and come to
&+Lthis small trail through a forestry alcove to rest.  Small garnets,
&+Lbroken wagon wheels, and old camp grounds lie all around this area,
&+Lcreating a cluttered feeling.  The trail leads off to the south by
&+La small brook that would have gone unnoticed by anyone unless they
&+Lstopped here. A canopy of tree leaves covers the small shining brook,
&+Lproviding a nice set of shade.  A huge boulder lies to the east.

&+gringing through the air.  The smell of recently bloomed flowers supplies
&+gthe air with a pleasant smell.  Some people have left the trail at this
&+gpoint to go set up camp in the forest, but there are no worn trails in
&+gthat direction.  The main camping around and brook lies to the south.

&+WA Small Room at the Front of the Tavern&n~
&+c   This room was originally intended as a place where patrons would have to&n
&+ccheck their weapons before allowed inside, but that idea proved impractical&n
&+cfor the management.  It was decided that a better idea would be to station a&n
&+cbouncer here who would stop anyone from entering who appeared as if they&n
&+cwere going to cause trouble.  This has cut down on some of the troubles, but&n
&+cthe tavern is not compeltely free of violence.&n

&+cno pretensions about being fine dining, it does serve several hearty meals.    &n
&+cThe nearby miners often troop in to eat here and thus a steady flow of business&n
&+cexists for the tavern.  Several large skulls are hanging from the walls and a&n
&+clarge target has been mounted on a wall.&n

   &+gOnce grand &+madamantine&+g gates hang from decaying hinges as forlorn reminders
&+gof a once grand city, teeming with life. The &+Wm&+Lar&+Wbl&+Le&+g walls of this city
&+gare almost completely overgrown with shrubbery from the surrounding &+Gwilderness&+g,
&+gwhile the gates themselves remain clear of any intrusion by the forces
&+gof nature. An almost tangible sensation of life seems to emanate
&+gfrom within the gates... which would feel quite invigorating if it were
&+gnot combined with &+Lstink&+g of unnatural &+Ldeath&+g. The tattered gates before you
&+gseem to scream like a voice long since silenced from an untimely demise
&+gthat it still cannot accept, and never will.

Through the &+mAdamantine&N Gates~
   &+YCr&+yumbli&+Yng&N remains of this once great city surround you wherever you look.
Guard towers hang in &+rruin&N above you, walls appear to be on the verge of
caving in, and formerly &+Wpolished stone&N beneath your feet has cracked to
pieces or turned to &+Ldust&N. Many of the pathetic remnants around you are
&+Lblackened&N by what you guess would be an enormous &+Rco&+rnfl&+yagr&+rat&+Rion&N. &+rFire&N that
could &+Linc&+riner&+Late&N such hardy &+wstone&N would have to be more powerful than
any known &+Mmagic&N of this realm. To the south is an intersection of paths.

   You can actually smell the revolting &+Yodor&N of &+Lcharred&N &+yflesh&N mingling with
that of &+rf&+yir&+re&N scarred rock as you enter the main courtyard of &+BTzultaire&N.
Jagged pieces of &+wstone&N jut outward from the &+yearth&N above enormous &+Lblack
&+Lrips&N in the soil. To the southwest stands a building that amazingly has
been spared much of the force that &+rannihalated&N this place. The most striking
feature that catches you eye is the enormous pile of &+Yru&+ybb&+yle&N to the
southeast, which obviously bore the brunt of the assault that &+Ldevastated&N
this place. A once mighty &+mtower&N lies broken in two pieces and &+Lburned&N to
a crisp. The upper half of the &+mtower&N lies to the far east like a cylindrical
&+Wskeleton&N that never had a proper burial, utterly flayed by &+rfl&+yam&+re&N and &+Lburnt&N
to its &+rcore&N. &+LTorched&N paths of ruined &+wco&+ybb&+wle&+yst&+won&+ye&N lie in all directions.

&+g   &+GTrees, bushes, and shrubs&+g prevent you from seeing far beyond the pathway
&+galthough the pathway itself has been kept quite &+wclear&+g of &+Govergrowth&+g. Your
&+geyes relax a little as they take in the pleasant &+bc&+co&+gl&+yo&+mr&+g variations here as
&+gthey attempt to forget the &+Lstructural carnage&+g inside the city. The path
&+gcontinues to the south, sloping downward even more than before. To the north
&+gthe city walls can be seen.

&+gmuch. The magnificent &+Gtrees&+g form a canopy high overhead, and the &+Gbushes&N
&+gat your feet sprout fragrant &+bfl&+cow&+bers&+g. The path continues south, further

&+cinvade. The clearing is almost perfectly round, and could easily accomodate
&+ctwenty people. A ring of &+Wstones&+c lies in the center of the clearing forming
&+ca &+rf&+yir&+re&+c pit. A &+rf&+yir&+re&+c blazes in the pit, the &+rflames&+c licking the &+ycarcass&+c of

&+cTo the south lies a large &+yhut&+c of impressive construction.

&+WAn Enormous Slab of &+wStone~

&+wtake a northern turn towards the &+Lblack&+w and &+Wwhite&+w &+rblasted remains&+w of
&+wthe huge &+mtower&+w.  The tower's base lies in a twisted U-shaped formation,

&+wentrance can easily be seen to the west.  Just like the &+mtower&+w section
&+wto the west, this portion is bent into a U-shape from a horrible,

&+wto the northeast.  The roadway itself is dotted with holes sized from

&+L   Natural &+Wlight&+L has not penetrated this far into the &+mtower&+L in quite
&+Lsome time.  Despite the numerous obvious holes in the &+mtower's&+L exterior,
&+Lthe interior of this tomb only becomes darker and darker the further in
&+Lyou go.  The first bright ANYTHING you've seen in here so far lies near
&+Lthe footpath you are picking through in this chamber.  The remains of what
&+Lmust have been a beautiful &+wcha&+cndel&+wier&+L rest in peace between two large
&+Lboulders.  The &+wmetal&+L framework survived the &+rhot &+Rdoom&+L that befell here,

&+Lstrewn about in the form of &+cshiny&+L, &+Wsp&+Carkl&+wing&+L crystals, as fine as &+ysand&+L.
&+LThe reflections of your &+Wlight&+L sources on the crystals create a pleasant

&+L&+Willuminate&+L and enhance several dark figures which quickly duck out of
&+Lsight with a loud clattering noise.

&+Lagain to produce some very interesting &+Bc&+mo&+bl&+mo&+Brs&+L, ranging from pitch
&+Lblack to &+Wbone white&+L.  What you find puzzling is that the room gets
&+Ldarker and darker as the ceiling surface converges on where the cracked
&+Lbend in the &+mtower&+L should be, instead of allowing outside &+wlight&+L in.

&+Lnumerous jagged surfaces on the walls next to you.  Could it be your

&+Lstairs are not connected to each other, they bear no framework, they
&+Lsimply exist.  The rectangular pieces of &+Revil&+L lead upward and northward
&+Linto an equally dark section of the roof, which is much darker than the

&+yRoad Along the Northern Wall~
&+w   The separated piece of the fated &+mtower&+w forms a reluctant pathway
&+walong the northern wall.  Flakes and chunks of &+Wrock&+w from both the
&+wdecaying &+mtower's &+Wspire&+w and the &+Rfire&+w-&+Lassaulted&+w wall make walking slow
&+wand tedious, not to mention &+rdangerous&+w.

&+wIntersection Before the &+mTower~
&+w   You stand among two pieces of the befallen &+mtower&+w, making it feel
&+wlike you're looking at a massive &+yshipwreck&+w.  What looks like the top
&+wof the &+mtower&+w has shattered and fallen to the southeast, a pathway
&+wheading to the south leads between the &+Ldestroyed sections&+w.  To the
&+wsouthwest lies the majority of the &+mtower&+w, or what's left of it.  The
&+wground is a bit more &+Wsolid&+w here and not quite as powdery.  A rather
&+wunsafe opening lies to the south, while an equally unsafe looking road
&+wleads east.  To the west lies an &+Linc&+riner&+Lated&+w, gray road.

&+mBetween The Tower~
&+w   You stand between two looming and equally unpleasant pieces of the
&+wmighty &+mtower&+w.  The eastern piece is the fallen upper reaches of the
&+mtower&+w, to the west is the main reaches of the &+mtower&+w.  Both pieces
&+whave yielded a lot of &+cdroppings&+w over the course of time in the form of
&+yyellowed &+Wboulders&+w and lesser, almost &+Lvolcanic waste&+w.  Every now and
&+wthen you can clearly hear another section of the once grand construct
&+whit the ground with a hollow thud.  Common sense tells you that this is
&+wnot a safe place to be.  An isolated intersection lies back to the north,
&+wto the south a ruined &+Gpark&+w sprawls out.

&+cEnd of a Hallway~
   &+LThis hallway leads through this underground outpost's remains.  Small,
&+Lblack lumps of charred flax are nested in torch sconces, omnipresent
&+Lthroughout all hallways in this outpost.  The filthy, tattered remains
&+Lof a once-red carpet lies partially covering the floor like the garments
&+Lof a whore.  This ravaged, desecrated ruin now bares home to the unforgiving
&+Ldead risen.

&+GA Destroyed Chamber&N~
   &+GPerhaps once having served as a break room for the soldiers
&+Gwho defended this outpost, this chamber now sits in total dissaray,
&+Ghaving faced the destruction and looting of many years of abuse in
&+Gabandonment.  Scraps of rotting wood lie across the floor along
&+Gwith smashed cookware, humanoid bones, and scraps of linens and other
&+Gdebris.

&+LA &+rRuined &+LBarracks&N~
   &+LThis ancient barracks houses four bunk beds in two rows of two.  These
&+Lside-by-side beds in this barracks house a few of the soldiers that would
&+Lhave once occupied this human outpost.  This barracks currently, however
&+Lstands completely destroyed with filth and debris covering the area.
&+LThe mattresses left in tact on these beds are stained and plagued by
&+Lthe foul corruption that haunts this mountain.

&+rA Ransacked Officer's Quarters&N~
   &+LThis chamber, although similar in dimension to the barracks of this
&+Loutpost, normally would have housed only one man.  This is the captain's
&+Lchamber, officer of this outpost and first lieutenant to the Tharnadian
&+Lwar council.  This was the purpose of this room, but since has been
&+Lcompletely ransacked.  The desk lies smashed in a pile of wooden chunks
&+Land splinters.  The bed looks to have been hacked completely in half, po-
&+Lssibly during a struggle.

&+BA Sparring Hall&N~
  &+BThis long hall was designed with proper girth for at least eight
&+Bone-on-one sparring duels can take place.  Three pillars rest in
&+Bthe center of this chamber, equidistant from one another.  The
&+Bonce-polished floor of this carved-out domain lies stained with
&+Bblood and caked with filth.  Empty torch sconces line the walls
&+Babove, while the lower walls are covered with old, rusty weapon
&+Bracks.

&+WThe &+MQuartermaster's &+WShop&N~
   &+WThis ancient shop sits here deep within this ruined human outpost.
&+WOriginally, this shop served as a rewards equipment office for the
&+WTharnadian war council to award the most noblest of their soldiers to
&+Wbuy only certain magical and reverred items seized in the great wars
&+Win exchange for Tharnadian marks of honor.  This shop, understandably,
&+Whas been ruined just like the rest of this outpost.

   &+LThis small office, overlooking the sparring hall, sits as the
&+Loperations center for the battlemaster of the outpost, general to
&+Lthe Tharnadian army.  Although now ruined and vacated, this chamber
&+Lserved as a pivitol planning area for the most elite soldiers to
&+Lreceive their orders and command their troops.

&+gAtop the Dungeon Stairs~
   &+gThis green, marble staircase has obviously been given more
&+gattention then any of the other structural work of this outpost.
&+gPossibly exemplifying the lavishment the men of Olde took in
&+gtheir dungeon-keeping, this once-lavish staircase opens down
&+gto the dungeon gates at their bottom.

&+gBent, Mis-shapen Dungeon Gates&N~
   &+gThe dungeon gates of this lower prison of the outpost have been
&+gbent out of shape, while one side barely hangs on by one hinge.
&+gIt is obvious that something either caused a lot of damage to get
&+gout of this jail cell, or perhaps into it.  The jail and dungeon
&+gbeyond these dilapidated gates are cloaked in darkness.

&+Lmetal sleeping shelf and a shit hole.  This disgusting, old dungeon
&+Lacts as a jail to prisoners of the Tharnadian Alliance of Olde and

&+Levil pleasure in their work.  This filthy dungeon opens up to
&+La few rows of cells before leading to the torture chamber.

   &+rThis ancient torture chamber is nearly identical size to the rest
&+rof the entire dungeon, including all the cells.  Two large racks sit
&+ron the wall with several odd chains and shackles hanging from the
&+rceiling and from all positions.  The ancient desks and tables in
&+rthis chamber are carved out of the Blackrock stone that makes up
&+rthese mountains, hinting at a perfectionist approach to such a
&+rominous chamber.

&NA Secret &+LCrawl&Nspace&N~
&+L  A secret, dark, and quite rank crawlspace leads deep under an
&+Lunderground cell of this once fortified outpost prison.  Most-likely
&+Lone of the inmates with an extended sentence bided their time well
&+Lby tunneling out.  However the crawlspace is very tight and narrow,
&+Lsuggesting that this small stash storage place may have been the
&+Lhiding place for treasures, and the end of a futile attempt at escape.
