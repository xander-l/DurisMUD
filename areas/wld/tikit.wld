End Of The Path~
The path seems to end here, and before you lies a vast city, overgrown and half
hidden by the emmense forest. Fear starts to grip you, and you wonder if you
should turn back now, or press onward.
To the north, you see a large monument of some sort, portruding from the
darkness.

&+WThe Archway&N~
The monument you saw from the south turns out to be a large stone archway,
which seems to mark the entrance to this once magnificent city. Standing on
each side of the archway is a huge stone figure of some sort, depicting some
kind of ape-like creature you have never before laid eyes on. A huge iron gate
protects the city from intruders.

This large iron gate is rusted from time, though still holds its purpose well
enough.

&+GCity Entrance~
As you enter the ancient, ruined city, the thick cover of trees above you
subsides a litte, making the sky partially visable. All around you see many
buildings falling apart, but seemingly held together by the vines that cover
them. Although the city may have been abandoned long ago, it appears to have
been re-inhabited by some ape-like creatures that are wandering around. A
feeling of dread seems to permeate from the air, and a slight shiver runs
down your spine. To your east, west, and north, overgrown roads stem out
into the city.

You are walking along what appears to be one of the busiest roads in the city.
Thorny bushes cover the buildings which line the street. Trees which look as
old as time itself stem forever upwards, disappearing into the sky. This
stretch of road seems to go on forever to the east and west. The sound of a
flowing river can be heard east.

A Well-Traveled Street~
You are walking down an ancient street that seems well traveled. Vines and
brush form an unpenatrable wall to the south. On the north side of the street,
you see the side of an old stone building. The street continues east and west.

&+wA Large Dwelling&N~
&+RBlood&N splatters the walls here, turning the normal &+Lgrey&N stone walls&+r deep red&N.
Cages filled with frightened cats fill this room, stacked 4 or 5 cages high,
all along the walls. Painful cries and meuws can be heard coming from the west,
and some blood squirts in from that direction as a flash of &+Clightning&N lights
up the room. The street lies to the south.

Cages filled with frightened cats fill this room, stacked 4 or 5 cages high,

maggots almost done with their meal, others freshly killed. A few cat skulls
scatter the ground, detached from the rest of their bodies. &+bB&+Br&+ba&+Bi&+bn&+Bs&N ooze down
the walls, and pieces of fur and flesh stick to the ceiling. More carnage can
be seen east.

Heaps of weapons lay in piles on the floor here. This must be the room where
all of the displayed weapons are kept when the weapon shop is closed. The room
is small and cramped, the walls are barren and cracked, and the only exit out
is back into the &+Rforging&+r room&N to the north.

&+BAlong the &+GTikitzopl&+B River~
This is the &+GTikitzopl&+b River&N, a fairly docile and narrow river that is the major
water supply for many animals living in the surrounding area. Ruins of old
buildings can be seen around as the river flows through the once great city of
Tikitzopl. The waters wind their way through a deep gorge, with steep walls on
both sides, which cuts its way through the city. The walls of the gorge are
wet and smooth, preventing any climbing, and rarely allowing access up to the
city. Thick vines and brush make passage south impossible.

they could collapse if too much weight was put on them. The street west heads
back into the main part of the city, and to the east, the street leads towards
some citizens' homes.

This is the southeast corner of a fairly large plaza, where many of the
citizens of this city gather after a hard darys work. The ground is cleared of
all vegetation, leaving just a well padded dirt ground beneath your feet.
Wooden benches can be seen around different parts of the plaza, and a large
wooden statue of a gorilla-like animal dominates the center of the plaza. Small
carts of various arts and crafts line the plaza, as do other stands selling

&+YThe Plaza&n~
This is the southeast corner of a fairly large plaza, where many of the
citizens of this city gather after a hard darys work. The ground is cleared of
all vegetation, leaving just a well padded dirt ground beneath your feet.
Wooden benches can be seen around different parts of the plaza, and a large
wooden statue of a gorilla-like animal dominates the center of the plaza. Small
carts of various arts and crafts line the plaza, as do other stands selling
fruits and vegetables. The &+GTikitzopl &+briver&N flows around this part of the plaza,
adding even more to the serenity.
The plaza continues south and west, and you can always jump down the steep
cliff, into the &+briver&N to the north. A heavily-traveled street is to the
east.

To the south, what used to be the entrance to this library, the wall has

You are walking along what appears to be one of the busiest roads in the city.
Thorny bushes cover the buildings which line the street. Trees which look as
old as time itself stem forever upwards, disappearing into the sky. This
stretch of road seems to go on forever to the east and west. The sound of a
flowing river can be heard west. Entrances to buildings are on both sides of
the street.

The entrance to this structure is littered with broken and damaged pieces of
equipment, making it hard to walk through. Most of what lies in this room is
worn-out, or bludgeoned armor of many different sorts. The roof of this
building seems about to give at any time. More of the &+brepair shop&N is to the

any debris that might get in the way, and the room actually looks well
maintained. A workbench at the back of the room has a few weapons and tools
lying on it.

This ancient forest seems to be undisturbed, and probably unseen by any man.
A feeling of peace comes over you as you realize how safe this forest feels.
A bit of sky can be seen through the dense cover of trees, creating a sort of
twilight around you. Small animals skitter around the ground, apparently not
even phased by your presense. Birds can be heard singing their songs, and
the sounds of many other animals fills the air.

This ancient forest seems to be undisturbed, and probably unseen by any man.
A feeling of peace comes over you as you realize how safe this forest feels.
A bit of sky can be seen through the dense cover of trees, creating a sort of
twilight around you. Small animals skitter around the ground, apparently not
even phased by your presense. Birds can be heard singing their songs, and
the sounds of many other animals fills the air.

&+RA Sacrificial Pit&n~
This area has been cleared out of the forest, and turned into a spiritual
gathering area. A huge pit lies in the center of the room, extending down well
past the line of sight. Stone altars lie on 2 sides of the pit, showing this
pit is probably meant for sacrifices. To the south, the entrance to a temple
can be seen.

A Temple Entrance~
A stone, triangle shaped building seems to emerge from the ground, forming the
entrance to a large underground temple. The entrance is blocked by 2 large
stone doors with a huge, magical lock. An emblem on the door warns of imminent
death to any that dare enter. Its probably a good idea not to go in there.

&+LTemple Entrance&N~
   Giant marble steps lead downward into the entrance of this once sacred
temple. Having been barricaded off for so long, the steps are no longer clean
and sparkling as they once were, but are now covered in dust and debris from
the years of neglect this entranceway has seen. Another large door can be
downward, while fresh open air lies to the east.
