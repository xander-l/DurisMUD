&+yRolling &+gPlains~
  &+g Traveling through the plains you come to a small forested area filled with&n
&+gtrees that have grown tall as they grew ancient.   As you draw nearer to this&n
&+gforest, you start to hear the sounds of wild life that was not as predominate&n
&+gthrough the plains.  The path ahead of you starts to become more engrossed in&n
&+gtrees, and up ahead you notice the trees seem to thicken into a dense forest.&n
&+gFrom here you can also see some rolling hills in the distance. There seems to&n
&+gbe a wildlife path that cuts through the woods in front of you.  Though it is&n
&+gover-grown from lack of heavy use, wildlife still uses enough to see.  As you&n
&+gcontinue your trek forward, you note that the path seems to have been a stone&n
&+gwalkway at one time that has broken down and crumbled with the sands of time.&n

     &+gTraveling further around the pond to the northern side, the waters of the&n
&+gpond &+wsparkle &+gand &+Wshimmer&+g in the light.   The abundant wildlife nearby seems to&n
&+gbe teeming with many creatures, some of which one would never believe existed.&n
&+gMany brightly colored furred animals swing from tree to tree, while others run&n
&+galong side the waters as if there was no threat of attack. The wind here blows&n
&+gslightly out of the north, bringing with it a cool, gentle mist that leaves an&n
&+ginvigorating feeling to all it touches.&n

&+gwaters appear to be teeming with &+yfish&+g and other &+caquatic &+gwildlife that thrives&n

    &+gThe &+bstream&+g flows in from the northwest in a steady and fast pace.  At times&n
&+gthe sound of water crashing into rocks is louder here.  A gentle wind brings in&n
&+ga light &+Bm&+Wis&+Bt&+g that soaks the area.  The rocks have a light &+Gm&+go&+Gs&+gs&+Gy&+g coating, making&n
&+git hard at times to get a good, firm footing while traveling along the edges of&n
&+gthe &+bstream&+g.  The &+bwater&+gborne life does not seem to be as apparent here as it was&n
&+gfurther down the &+bstream&+g.   The waters are a bit darker then they were, yet they&n
&+gare still pretty clear, and the bottom of the stream can be easily seen.  Birds&n

&+bhigher then most of the &+gtrees&+b lining the stream. The &+Bmi&+Ws&+Bt &+bis thick, making the&n

&+bthough a blanket of water was settling slowly to the ground.  Despite theheavy&n
&+bfeel to the air, it feels very nice in the heat of the sun.   All the cares of&n
&+bthe world wash away as the mist gently sprays your face.  The path ahead seems&n
&+bto lead the to waterfall then disappear behind the rush of water.  The path is&n
&+bworn and has eroded over time.  It is starting to show its age here where most&n
&+bof the stonework had been very intricate but has worn away.&n

&+Ybeen built here, possibly countless ages ago yet it still stands unchanged from&n
&+Ythe day it was made, except for the discoloration of the sand forming the walls&n
&+Yaround it.   The keep itself seems familiar, but who knows.  It could be one of&n
