&+cCity Gates of Bugentolen~
&+g A forest path leads up to these tall wooden gates that have been supported
&+gwith different sheets of broken armor. There are city walls that extend
&+garound the city, which doesn't seem to be that large. A little ways off to
&+gthe east, a bridge can be seen. There are several slits in the city walls
&+gfor archers to mount ballistas and protect their village. The path leading
&+gup to this village is rocky, but muddy and the gates also so a large amount
&+gof filth.

&+Lare many guts that have not been cleaned up and have been left to rot among
&+Lthe dirt and fur of animals. There is a small sign on his butcher table
&+Lshowing different prices for different meats and delicious items. Screams
&+Lof horror can usually be heard from this room as captured animals get pre-
&+Lpared for lunch and dinner. On the left walls lies a huge chopping board
&+Lwhere the butcher can often be seen hacking away at some animals head and

&+mEntrance to a Dark Temple~
&+L Here lies the entrance to a huge building aproximatly one hundred feet
&+Lin height. This building is composed of imeasurable materials, however
&+Lsome are more noticeable. Gutted skulls, caved in rib cages, and bones of
&+Lcountless animals and humans make up the foundation of this structure.
&+LHowever, on top of all the dead animal parts lies huge logs of timber and
&+Lferns to keep the rain off of them. The door itself is ten feet high with
&+La huge skull directly above it, with two rubies as its eyes, and an emerald
&+Lin the place of the mouth.

&+Lare made from huge tree trunks, along with the floor. There is a green
&+Lmesh carpte that covers the floor. A small fountain is off in the left

&+Lbugbear shamans, who have endoured many long hours of training, prepare
&+Lfor training. The hallway is lit with skull topped torches where the fire
&+Lburns out the eyes. There are many statues of horried beasts next to each

anywhere where someone could escape. Houls of pain can be heard from
inside as tortures try to get information from the prisoners. The building
is basically a concrete fortress with abosultly no windows, only small
slits at the edge of the base of the building, to circulate air, and drain
blood. The prison itself sits ontop a small hill and huge iron gates
surround this fortress like prison.

&+mThe Feeding Area~
&+L Despite its attractive outside appearance, this house is actually a
&+Lfeeding place for creatures of the town. Many bugbears can be seen coming
&+Lhere for all meals of the day, since the town provides it. The upstairs
&+Lhas been totally destroyed, with only a little bit of rubble remaing on
&+Lthe ground, leaving more space for food storage. There is also a small
&+Lcorner of the big house where bugbears can relieve themselves. The walls
&+Lare covered in food splatters, as is the ceiling, and floor.

&+Land playing, however every so often, one falls and hurts itself. There is
