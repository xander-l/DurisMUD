&+WRothe Enclosure~
   &+yThe smell of dung and rotting fungi assails the air making it damp
&+yand fetid. The rothe feed and clothe most of the goblins of Truktakyagyo,
&+yand they would probably die off or be forced to move without them.&n

&+LGoblin Barracks~
   &+bBenches, stained cots and weapons racks are all over this room. The
&+bguards and warriors of the settlement stay here when they aren't guarding
&+bor patrolling Truktakyagyo. The walls are stone and cracked in a few spots.
&+bA large table dominates the center of the room, probably used for meetings
&+bor planning.&n

&+LA Dark Cave&n~
&+L    The floor of this cave has been cleared of larger rocks, and rotting
&+Lcrates full of fungi and moldy furs are carelessly strewn near the wall.
&+LWarg &+ydung&+L gives the room a distinct aroma. Clearly a large deal of traffic
&+Lmoves through this area, but the travellers aren't especially concerned
&+Lwith cleanliness. Typical &+Ggoblins&n.
