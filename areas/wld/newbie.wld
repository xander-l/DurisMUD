&+GA Lush Field&+g Ringed by a &+GProtective &+gHedge&N~
&+G   A field open&+gs up before you, bordered upon t&+Ghree sides by a high &+ghedge
&+Gprevents passag&+ge to the north or west.  The hed&+Gge circles about the
&+Gfield, directin&+gg traffic down an alleyway of fl&+Gattened stones placed&+g into
&+Gthe ground.  To&+g the south, a brief hole in the &+Ghedge allows access t&+go a
&+Gsmall hut.  The&+g hedge appears to grow into the &+Groof of the hut and a&+glong
&+Gthe walls ensur&+ging that no traveler gets around&+G the outside of the b&+guilding.
&+GSeveral tall tr&+gees stand just outside the hedge&+G, filtering light thr&+gough
&+Gtheir leafy bou&+gghs.  The field is populated by &+Gseveral different gra&+gss types
&+Gthat comingle a&+gnd create a lush, flowing green &+Glandscape.  Small shr&+gubs and
&+Gbushes dot the &+gfield as well, providing ample h&+Giding space for small&+ger
&+Gcritters.  Abov&+ge the alley to the east, the top&+Gs of some other simpl&+ge huts
&+Gcan be seen.&N

&+WA Pathway of &+LCobbled Stones&N~
&+W   Flattened cobbles create a pathway bordered by lush green grasses here.
&+WThe path runs away from this area to the north and south, passing near

&+Winto the air to the east, creating a natural wall.  Barely visible above the

&+cbeneath the bottom-most stones.&n

Inside a &+CRed&+Wee&+Cmed &+mNecromancer's &+LCrypt&n~
  &+LYou are inside a dark, dusty crypt that served as the training area&n
&+Lfor the &+mNecromancers. &+LA row of &+ycoffins&n &+Llie to one side for those who&n
&+Lneed a resting spot. In the center of the room a black candle &+Yburns&+L,&n
&+Land young students sit resting, chanting to themselves. Dark magic&n
&+Lfills the air here. Standing in the dark room, a faintly glowing figure
&+Lseems to stand immune to the dark magics. Attempting to quell the ancient
&+Levil, the theurgist's pressence seems to eminate a warm and comfortable
&+Laura to those within range.&n

&+yInside the Elven Destroyer Named '&+WLil&+Cynsw&+Wift&+y'&n~
  &+ySoaring oaken beams from trees that must have been imaginably tall&n
&+yform the bones and ribs of this great destroyer. The areas both on&n
&+ydeck and inside the vessel are open and elegant, with exactly those&n
&+ythings as are required to run an efficient operation and no more. The&n
&+yonly exception to this strict minimalisation are graceful hand-painted&n
&+ybanners of silk that run from ceiling to floor, along the inner sides&n
&+yof the hull and from masts and lines in the sails. An exit to the&n
&+ynorth of the ship leads down a wide and solid wooden gankplank back to&n
&+ythe stable grounds of the docks.&n

  This is would a typical storage locker would look like. You would have
a chest inside to put equipment into and have the ability to sort them.
To leave the locker you would '&+Yopen door north&n' and leave into the bank
of the hometown. Each person is assigned their own locker which is totally
secure from other players. While in your locker if you would like to
sort items one example would be '&+Ysort equip hitpoints&n'. This would make
a new chest for you full of equipment with hitpoints flags. When you leave,
the equipment defaults back to the main storage chest. For more help you can
type '&+Yequip sort&n' in your locker and get ALL the options available.
You can also grant up to 10 others use of your locker. Read '&+Yhelp locker&n'
and '&+Yhelp storage&n'.
