&+ySteep Trail on a Cliffside&n~
   Just wide enough for three grown human men to walk side-by-side, this
trail is treacherous and almost at a forty-five degree angle, steeply
running along the side of a high cliff. Below the cold ground can be seen,
dotted by evergreen trees and large rocks. A thin wisp winds its way along
the ground, the road which led to this cliffside trail, looking like just
a thin line from up here. The air is colder and thinner, making the travel
tough.

stone surface. To the south, a cliffside continues, but the plateau stops,
dropping down to the base of the mountain. This small area has been made,
just like the stone towers and gates. Dwarven runes depicting the history
of the stronghold cover the gates, made perfectly with hammer and chisel.&n

&+cmountain insignia of Kimordril. Huge gates lie to the west and east,
&+cmade of stone and set in with great skill, making them open and close
&+ceasily, but able to withstand an attack from an army of giants when

&+cPrimary Barracks&n~
   This building is the main barracks for the western area of Kimordril.
Large and roomy, it could easily fit a small army of dwarves. This is only
the first floor, there being two stories to this barracks. The upper floor
is much larger, because it bridges over the pathway leading up to the west
gates. Lockers line the walls, full of light replacement gear for any dwarf
who goes without or cannot retrieve his own in case of an emergency.&n

&+GFungi Storage Room&n~
   &+gHuge crates stacks high fill this room, almost blocking off the
&+gstairway leading up to this floor. Pictures of fungi have been
&+gstamped and drawn on the crates, suggestion that this is a storage
&+groom, or room used to keep an emergency supply of food handy in.
&+gMost of the crates are nailed tightly shut.

are covered in ancient dwarven runes, most likely unreadable by most
dwarves in the stronghold. To the south a small intersection can be seen.

   A smaller altar is here, for separate use in private ceremonies for
the dwarven goddess of Berronar. Some items made out of silver have been
set permanently into the surface of the altar, be means unknown. Small
torches on each wall light the room. Two small bowls are raised up on
pedestals on each side of the room. An opening to the south leads to
the entrance of the inner sanctum.
