   The semi-clean street continues to the east and west here.
The tall buildings on either side of the road seem to loom over
the street like vultures over a dying man in the desert.  The air
seems stifled, and it feels almost as if there is some sound in
the air just barely above the frequency human ears can detect.  It
is not audible, but the non-sound forms a pressure on the eardrums
that is distinctly uncomfortable.

&+LThe Dark Tunnel&n~
   The tunnel stretches off into shadows to the east and west.  The air is
not entirely musty nor stale, but is not quite clean or fresh.  The ground
underfoot is sand, and the walls are of sandstone.  There is a fairly strong
smell or feeling of menace in the air; it seems to be coming from the west.

   The tunnel here evidently extends only to the west.  To the north there
is a flat wooden panel affixed on a hinge that would open fairly easily.
The sand underfoot muffles footsteps quite well; there is a distinct sense
of danger in the air.  It is hard to tell from which direction it comes from.
The eastern wall is flat sandstone, and to the west the tunnel disappears
into darkness.

   The air on this side of the sandstone wall is noticeably drier and much
mustier than the rest of the tunnel.  There is a strange scent of decay all
around, as if a very large rat had crawled in here and died.  There are
odd inscriptions and hieroglyphs carved into the walls here.

   The tunnel makes an abrupt twist to the south here.  There are many old

   There is a small archway built into the tunnel here -- partially to
support the ceiling, partially decoration.  There is a large sphinx sculpted
into the keystone of the arch, and more glyphs and death's heads inscribed
on the pillars of the arch.  It is obvious that this marks the entrance to
a tomb or other ritual burial site of some sort.
