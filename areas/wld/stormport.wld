&+yA Trail Between the Rocks&n~
&+y   Branching out east and west of this trail are huge, jagged, rocks
&+yjutting upwards, making the thought of scaling it to get into the city
&+yby bypassing the &+bgates&+y seem dangerous and difficult.  The trail itself
&+yappears to be used often, and wagon tracks as well as the usual prints
&+yof foot traffic can be seen in the earth. Up ahead and around the
&+ycorner are the southern &+bgates&+y of &+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort.&n

Before the South &+bGates&n of &+WSto&+Lrm&+b Port&n~
&+y   Just outside the &+bgates&+y and through the trail between the rocky
&+yterrain south, the sounds and smells of &+WSto&+Lrm&n &+bPort&+y are intense.
&+LOrc &+Wmerchants&+y can be heard shouting out their wares and just around
&+ythe corner the vigilant &+bgate&+c guards&+y jostle their weapons, clanking
&+yiron on iron.  The smell of the &+bsea&+y has become overpowering, a
&+ysalty mist floats in the air, not severe, but enough to cause
&+ydiscomfort.&n

The South &+bGates&n of &+WSto&+Lrm&n &+bPort&n~
&n   Although there are no walls surrounding the the &+Lorc&n harbour city
of &+WSto&+Lrm&n &+bPort&n, the terrain itself makes it almost a fortress. Large
rocks jutt out from the &+yearth&n almost mountainous in nature but no
where near as large. Despite this they still prove to deter invaders
from entering anywhere other than the three primary entrances to the
city.  The first and foremost being here, the south &+bgates&n of the
city, guarded by half a dozen &+celite &+Lorc&n guards.&n

On the Verge of &+WSquall&+L Road&n~
&n   Years ago, &+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort&n was built as just a &+bnaval&n &+Bharbour&n for the &+Lorc&n
armies.  Having spread their influence well across most of the country
they looked further for new lands to conquer or new allies to unite with.
The future of the &+Lorc&n kingdom was laying across the &+bseas&n.  This city
was but a military staging point at first, however, as the &+Lorc&n presence
grew so did the city. Today, it rivals even the distant &+chuman&n cities
it might as well as dense population.

&+WSquall &+LRoad&n West Intersection~
&n   In the early days, &+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort&n consisted solely of the &+Bharbour&n,
several small supply shops, and &+bnaval&n barracks connected by two
&+Lroads&n.  &+WSquall&n &+LRoad&n was one of those two.  North of here is a
small alley that connects up with another major street in the city,
&+LTem&+Wpest&+y Avenue&n.  The busy &+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort&+c bank&n sits to the west, and south
leads to the southern &+bgates&n.  The traffic here is amazing as &+Lorcs&n
bustle about, heading for the &+Bharbour&n, elsewhere in the city, or
outside town.

&n   This small road connects &+WSquall &+LRoad&n and &+LTem&+Wpest&+y Avenue&n, for those
wishing a more direct route to or from the southern &+bgates&n.  The &+ydirt&n
packed road is covered with litter as &+Lorcs&n living in the large buildings
on either side tend to just throw their trash out the windows. The
sounds of the &+Bharbour&n seem distant here, yet can still be heard. A
small shop sits east.&n

accomplish just as much as any of the self-proclaimed civilized races.

The &+bGate&n &+cGuard&n Barracks~
&n   This fair-sized building once served as barracks for the &+Wsailors&n
and &+bnaval&n officers when the &+Bharbour&n was used purely for the military.
Now it acts as a rest station for the &+bgate &+cguards&n and dock &+cguards&n,
so they can take short breaks during their shifts at the entrances
to the city.  The &+Lorc &+cguards&n don't believe much in relaxing on
the job, so this building is normally empty.&n  Ocassionally a young
&+Lorc &+rsoldier&n wanders in to take a nap on the bunks when he thinks no
one is watching.&n

&+C   Gale &+LRoad&n connects with &+LTem&+Wpest&n &+yAvenue&n here, one block away
from the &+Bharbour&n.  As the city grew, this intersection became

public, &+Wmerchants&n began to flock off the incoming ships and setting
up shop along &+LTem&+Wpest&+y Avenue&n, possibly making it the most second
most used intersection in the city.

quick route from the &+Bharbour&n to outside the city.  The &+cguards&n here
continue to remain vigilant of any unwelcome visitors, foremost being

&+ythrough the path quite dangerous.  If one would happen to slip or

larger than a regular blacksmithy, and certainly ultilizing better
trained metal workers, the foundry churns out bolts for the &+ywater&n
&+ywheel&n, lugnuts for &+yship&n masts, &+csolid metal&n brackets for securing
planks on the docks, and much, much more.  The &+cfoundry&n worker here
is a large &+Lorc&n, covered head to toe in &+Lsoot&n, grinning madly as he

to ship battles.  Although burial at &+bsea&n was the most practical option,
many of the dying were transported back to the city where an unused
portion of the city was transformed into a large graveyard almost
overnight. &+LTem&+Wpest&+y Avenue&n is still as a direct route from the &+Bharbour&n
to the graveyard. To the north lies the North &+WSto&+Lrm&n connector.

city are actually quite rare. In fact, due to the rock formations in
the surrounding area creating a haven from all sorts of bad weather,
the &+Bharbour&n was built on this spot because it was &+Wsto&+Lrm&n free.  Without
the &+Bharbour&n, the city would have never have flourished, thus leading
to quite an irony of sorts and the thoughts of whatever &+Lorc&n actually
named this town must have had a twisted sense of humour.

&+yit is probably not as large as many would hope it to be.  It consists

&+YGalleons&n &+yline the docks, completely overcrowding them and giving the

The &+LRoad&n to &+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort&n~
&+y   This pathway has been cut through the rocky terrain of the area
&+yand turned into a fairly well used road to the harbour city of
&+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort&+y.   The trail continues through the treacherous terrain
&+ythat protects the harbour from elements and towards the gates of
&+ythe city.  A group of mercenaries stand here, looking to the western
&+ygates and muttering something rather rude about &+Lorcs &+yin general.&n

North &+WSto&+Lrm &+cStreet&n~
&n   North &+WSto&+Lrm&+c Street&n was one of the last few roads to be constructed
in the city. After the popularity of the &+Bharbour&n, the &+yrocky&n terrain
had to be excavated to make room for the population explosion in the
northern sector.  All along the street &+Lorc &+Wmerchants&n and &+rsoldiers&n
can be seen wandering around. The sounds of the city has reached
a crescendo, with the shouts of the commoners, the steady rhythm of
the &+ywater wheel&n, far off drum beating, and the yipping of a &+ydog&n
someone has just kicked.

West End of North &+WSto&+Lrm&+c Street&n~
&n   North &+WSto&+Lrm&+c Street&n was one of the last few roads to be constructed
in the city. After the popularity of the &+Bharbour&n, the &+yrocky&n terrain
had to be excavated to make room for the population explosion in the
northern sector.  The street ends here, connecting to &+LTem&+Wpest&+y Avenue&n
south.  North lies the city &+csupply&n shop, where many of the &+Wsailors&n
purchase goods needed for their long voyages at &+bsea.&n

&n   &+LTem&+Wpest &+yAvenue&n and North &+WSto&+Lrm &+cStreet&n connect here with a small
alley inbetween a large set of homes to the east and nearly impassable
&+yrocky&n terrain to the west, though there does appear to be a faint trail,
seldom used, through the rocks.  The air here is filled with &+Lsmoke&n
from hundreds of burning fireplaces and the &+bsea&n mist drifting in from
the &+Bharbour&n.  It begins to hurt the lungs.&n

&+WSailor's &+cSupplies&n~
&n   This small shop, run by a short, devious, looking &+Lorc&n, supplies the
numerous &+Wsailors&n of the city with the much needed rations and equipment
that is crucial for long months at &+bsea&n.  The shopkeeper will sell and
buy anything from &+ybackpacks&n to &+cbroadswords&n for the right price, usually
marked up a sizable ammount from the craftsmen's huts.  The &+Wsailors&n
who spend their hard earned money here gripe, but in the end, pay
the full fee.

&+LThe Graveyard of &+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort&n~
&n   The graveyard of &+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort&n has grown considerably over the past few
years.  Even the &+Lpirate&n wars did not reach the body count of the dangers
of industrialization.  Since the city has reached its modern pinnacle,
more &+Lorcs&n have been &+ccrushed, &+Cstomped,&n &+mtrampled, &+Meaten, &+bdrowned, &+Bsquished,&n
&+rchoked, &nand &+Rexploded&n than ever in history.  This graveyard was more
important for urban deaths than the majority of war casualties.

&+WThe Nursery&n~
&n   Tucked away in the west end of the city, this &+Wnursery&n, run by the
&+WSto&+Lrm &+bPort&+W Matron&n, acts a daycare center for young &+Lorcs&n.  Since
most &+Lorc&n mothers are too busy during the day to care for their
children they send them here so they will be looked after properly.
It is unfortunate most of the children here now are either orphans
or abandoned, left in care of the &+WMatron&n till they are old enough
to fend for themselves.&n

&+yis a fairly common sight.  The ocean breeze blows through, cool and
&+yrefreshing and the smell of salt is strong, strengthening the lust of
&+ythe &+bsea&+y for numerous sailors.  &+YGalleons&+y and &+Yfrigates&+y can be seen
&+yboth entering and leaving the port almost systematically.

&n   The &+Caqueduct&n continues heading north and south, just wide enough to
allow a couple &+Lorcs&n to walk along it at the same time if they are willing
to get their feet wet.  Every couple paces a smaller half-pipe leads
down and to the west, ultimately to an &+Lorcish&n home or business, to
provide fresh &+Bwater&n.  Understandably, &+rDuergar&n foreman are the most
common sights along the top of the &+Caqueduct&n proving that the &+Lorcs&n did
not construct this fairly modern structure without help.

&n   The &+Caqueduct&n stone construction here has been impedded with
a large &+ywooden&n wheel that slowly keeps the &+Bwater&n flowing from the
&+breservoir&n and into the town.  Several half-pipes break away here,
more than any other place on the aqueduct as the &+Bwater&n wheel pumps
the fresh &+Bwater&n throughout the city.

of pure &+Bwater&n, a &+breservoir&n at the southern end of the town was created
by digging deep into the &+yearth&n away from the sea.  Once the&n &+breservoir&n
was established and stable, the &+Caqueduct&n was built to carry the &+Bwater&n
over the eastern side of the city, with small stone branches leading
out to western end to provide fresh &+Bwater&n to the numerous homes and

&+LBelow the Graveyard&n~
&+L   Underneath the graveyard lies the hidden rogues halls of &+WSto&+Lrm
&+bPort&+L.  It is extremely dark in here when the trapdoor above is closed.
&+LThe smell in the air is similiar to &+Gsulpher&+L, perhaps a new form of
&+Gpoison&+L being devised by the high assassins who lurk in these halls.
&+LThe stone tunnel leading south is relatively clean and free of
&+Lmost litter and debris.&n

&+LThe packed &+yearth&+L making up the walls, held back by nothing more than
&+La couple planks of &+ywood&+L.  The smell in the air is that strange musty,

&+Lexist down here. Other than &+gtrolls, &+rduergars, &+bogres,&+L or &+mdrow&+L, the

&+Lshall not steal from orc unless orc blantantly flashes valuables.
&+LDue to this clause most of the local cityfolk never have any money
&+Lor important posessions in plain sight, however, the thieves do
&+Lpick the &+Wsailors&+L clean at anytime possible, as these crewmen of

&+LThe Graveyard of &+WSto&+Lrm&+b Port&n~
&n   The &+rpoppies&n have almost overrun the earth here, the soil so thick
with &+Lorcish&n remains.  It would be almost a pretty picture if it were
not for the &+Wtombstones&n jutting from the ground as symbols of death and
the zombies lurking about, groaning hideously.  Occasionally, an &+Lorc&n
can be seen coming into the graveyard to pay respects to a lost friends,
a extremely un-&+Lorc&n-like think to do, however it is far more common to
see &+Lorcs&n come to this place to &+Wspit&n upon the graves of lost enemies.

&+LThe Graveyard of &+WSto&+Lrm&+b Port&n~
&n   Row after row of &+Wtombstones&n cover the surface of this graveyard,
speckled with &+rcrimson red poppies&n.  Obviously &+Lorc&+m necromancers&n seem
to enjoy this area immensely and take great pleasure in desecrating
the graves of the dead so that may raise a small number of zombies
and &+Wskeletons&n and leave them wandering the graveyard.  The sight
of these monstronisties is both an annoyance and a hinderance for
those &+Lorcs&n wishing to pay respects to deceased relatives or friends.

&+LWaiting Room of the Inn&n~
&n   The waiting room of the inn is a breeding ground for brawls.  Most
likely caused by the brawny &+Wsailors&n constantly flowing in and out
of the city, always rowdy and looking for a good time, including
beating on a few of the locals, however, the &+gtrolls&n and &+bogres&n who
frequent this inn have a tendancy to turn around and push the &+Wsailors&n
around, forcing the locals out of the room and back into the streets,
lest they fall prey to an &+bogre's&n fist or &+gtroll's&n forehead. A flimsey
staircase leads up to the inn itself.

&+Lthe most grueling of all the fighter classes, thus the reason their

Brawls between the &+Wsailors&n and city folk are a common thing in the

rage on for quite some time.  The innkeeper here is a burly &+Lorc&n,
most likely as burly as an &+Lorc&n could possibly get, and usually is
the one who breaks up the fights in frustation and sends the drunk
or unconcious to their beds.  &n

&+yThe Mercenary Halls&n~
&+L   These hallways mantain the necessary equipment to train an orc
&+ymercenary&+L.  They offer good practice in hiding and backstabbing, as
&+Lthe &+Ylanterns&+L are turned down for minimum light.   Several weeks of
&+Lintensive training here perfect the more specialized &+ymercenary&+L skills
&+Lthen the trainee will move to the &+Bwarrior&+L building and battle in
&+Lthe &+ysparring grounds&+L till he is ready.

&+Lwith a world of pain.  When the &+ymercenaries&+L are finished there

&+Lfinally, after becoming full fledged &+ymercenaries&+L, will travel

&+yBefore a Small Monestary&n~
&+y   The trail ends here with a sizeable area of flat ground spreading
&+yout to the north.  A small building has been built west, perhaps for
&+Lorcish &+Wpriests&+y wishing solitude in their prayers.  Small, unintim-
&+yidating, animals scurry about the plateau, squeaking just &+yloud
&+yenough to drown out the sounds of the city below.  Landslides seem
&+yto be common in this area, as several large piles of rocks has
&+yamassed at the more level sections of ground and trails in the
&+ylandscape have been cleared of all &+gvegetation&+y and left barren.
