&+mThe &+MOrgan &+mPit&n~
   &+mBubbling pearls of stench rise from deep within this pit,&n
&+mcarrying on them depravity and fresh pockets of decaying for&n
&+mthese insideous, awful beasts to devour, their eyes caked in&n
&+mlust, greed and malice. Unowned organs float in this mass, a&n
&+mbeacon of &+Wlight&+m.. or in this case.. &+Lda&+brkne&+Lss&+m..&n
