&+yAlong An Exposed Root of Yggdrasil&n~
&+y  Here lies the exposed root of the great tree Yggdrasil that runs
&+ythrough the planes, and even touches upon Jotunhiem.  Perpendicular
&+yto the "Giants Run Mountains," this exposed root has made provided
&+ya little cranny in the UD to which someone has taken a liking towards.
&+yProbably dug magically, the exposed root runs into a small cave-like
&+ystructure guarded by four eerily-eyed frost giants.  This root emits
&+ya soft magical glow, that is even more magnificent in the underdark,
&+ythan viewed on the surface.  The most disturbing thing about this
&+yarea is that it seems to be blanketted in shadow.

&+rA Huge Cave of Durithalite&n~
&+L  This huge cave seems to have been magically dug out by some
&+Lduergar mining company, most recognizably by the company's signature
&+Lmark carved in the stone. One of the mystical propertie of durithalite
&+Lis that it prevents magical remote entry into the area. The builders of
&+Lthis place obviously followed the drow design of Arachdrathos, which is
&+Lalso carved out of durithalite.  This cave is large with a few smaller
&+Ltunnels and caves leading off in various directions.  To the south
&+Least lies an exposed root of Yggdrasil.  The roots of that magnificent
&+Ltree help support this cave, making it one of the safest places to
&+Lbe in the entire underdark.  Along the floor of the cave lies the
&+Lremains of many killed good races, ranging from the slightly magical
&+Lcorpses of the magical grey elves to the extremely mutilated dwarf
&+Land barbarian corpses.  In each corner of the cave burns a mystical
&+Ldark torch that keeps this cave in perpetual twilight. A lagrge circular
&+Lstair case leads up, while a small cave is adjacant to the west.

&+mThe Forbidden Alcove of &+MIlixctthu&n~
&+m  This extension of the durithalite cave has been turned into the
&+mguild shop.  A ferocious illithid named Ilixctthu seems to have either
&+mbeen enslaved or else just a free suporter of the guild's evil cause.
&+mIn any case, the illithid makes this room look like an ancient warehouse
&+mby storing and buying all the treasures returned on raids.  The cave
&+mitself seems to be covered in a thin magenta ooze, probably excreeted
&+mby Ilixctthu.  The ooze has a faint hum and glows magically to anyone
&+mthat can detect it.  A small dedication plaque has been drilled into
&+mthe durithalite wall when this room was dug out.

&+rThe Blood &+WSkull &+rTavern&n~
&+L   One of the biggest questions on the minds of the creatures of
&+Lthe underdark is where these bloodlusted warriors end up sleeping and
&+Leating if they're always on the hunt for the good races of the world.
&+LFrom the looks of this tavern, this seem to be the place of resting
&+Lfor the great guild.  Each race has his own particularly sized bed,
&+Lfor example, the great ogres sleep on just a pile of furs, while the
&+Ldrow have elaborately carved dark wooden beds. One of the most noteable
&+Lthings that might catch one's eye upon enterring the room is one such
&+Lparticular pile of ogre furs that lies in the corner.  Between all of
&+Lthe savage races that come to this inn, skulls and bloody armor seem
&+Lto almost carpet the entire floor. There is a spiral staircase that
&+Lleads down into the main durithalite cavern. The main inn and lodging
&+Larea of the tavern lies to the north, while the bar and social board
&+Lare here at the front of the tavern.

&+rThe Barracks of The Blood &+WSkull &+rTavern&n~
&+L  This room is nothing more than bunk after bunk of drow-made bunks.
&+LThe room is kept soundly quiet, and completely dark.  There is nothing
&+Lout of the ordinary here, only armor hanging up on hooks as the
&+Lgreat warriors and casters sleep.  A few of them can be seen sitting
&+Lin their bunks memorizing spells, or getting ready to go raid. A few
&+Lguests of the clan have even been invited here to hold some of the
&+Lextra equipment that is scored off the good races.
