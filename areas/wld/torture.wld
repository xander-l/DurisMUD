&+W Greeting Chamber~
   &+mThis room gives all the new prisoners a warm welcome to the Ghore
&+mtorture complex; hard steel and a bad headache.  Veteran prisoners
&+mknow better than to stick around to be beaten and shackled.  A deep
&+mshaft in the center of the room serves as an exit to the hard labor area
&+mfor those who can't behave.  The main walk runs south.&n
