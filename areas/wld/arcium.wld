&+Ggreen.  There are many broken limps floating on the water.  The swamp has the
&+Gsmell of decaying prey.  The sound of crickets from the nearby surrounding is
&+Gtruly obnoxious.  It's hard to make out what is under the surface of the

&+y   This is the trail that leads away from the dark graveyard.  The trail is
&+ynarrow and has heavy forests on each side.  This trail doesn't seem to have
&+ybeen used as much as the rest of them, because it still has grass growing
&+yover it. There are many animals in the nearby forest.  The trail is easy to
&+yfollow because the forest has a definite lining.&n
