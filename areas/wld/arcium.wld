&+gthe bushes around this area.  The sounds of moaning in the distance can be

&+L   This is a scary looking graveyard.  There is a thick &+Cfog&+L across the whole
&+Lgraveyard.  The tombstones are corroded from the weather and are covered in
&+Lthick spider webs.  Some of the graves have been dug up by thieves looking for
&+Lvaluables.  There is heavy brush around the tombs.  In some places of the
&+Lgraveyard the tombs are so close together, that the people in the graves
&+Lmust have been stacked on each other.  Also the graveyard is rumored to have

&+g   This huge tree looks over a dark and dreary forest.  In part, because the
&+gtrees massive leaves are so dense they block out most sunlight.  Among the
&+ghuge tree limbs are wooden planks that connect the nearby trees.  The trunk
&+ghas a diameter of seven feet and is incased with bulky bark.  This is home
&+gto different species of birds and other critters.&n

&+LA Tower of Undead &+CMinions&n~
&+L   The tower is very nicely constructed.  The walls are made of light gray
&+Lstone that has been smoothed down.  This tower was once populated by a well
&+Lrespected society of nobles and their slaves.  Now the tower has been taken
&+Lover by a deadly disease that has now diminished the population and itself.
&+LThe tower is decorated with big rugs on the walls.  Each of the rugs has large
&+Lsymbols on it that has its own significance.  The whole inside of the tower
&+Lis engulfed in spider webs.&n

&+yThe walls are cold and slightly damp.  The walls are made of old cracked stone
&+yblocks.  The air in the dungeon smells bad and is very musty.  The dungeon was
&+ymade for the torture of the slaves.  There is an old entrance to the dungeon
&+ythat looks as if it was blocked off with boulders on purpose.&n
