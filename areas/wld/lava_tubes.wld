   This is a large mass of ice, moving ever so slowly down toward the
west, forcing its way between two mountains. The footing here is
relatively stable, but the ice and the angle of the slope make an
ascent up the glacier too risky.
   Rising straight up on the north is a tremendous spire of rock, whose
summit is enclosed in the clouds.

   This is a large mass of ice, moving ever so slowly down between two
mountains. The glacier continues to the west, where it angles off to
the south. The footing here is relatively stable, but the ice and the
angle of the slope make an ascent up the glacier too risky.
   A path leads up from the glacier on the north and there is a narrow
ledge on the southern mountain which could be scrambled up to - it

   The glacier makes a bend here, following its path of least resistance,
from the east down toward the south. The surface here is getting quite

   The glacier comes to an abrupt end here. Its leading edge appears
very unsafe, and several pieces could fall off at any time. Beyond the
edge is a forested valley and a lake. Sheer cliff walls surround this
area on the west and the east. A path is visible well up the wall on
the west, reachable via a rope ladder. The footing here seems unreliable
and the slightest move could be ill-advised.

   The ledge here is not large. Indeed, there is hardly any room to move

the rock of the mountain. This portal is made entirely of a metal

hinges, or any apparent mechanical devices. Aside from the door, it
is possible to climb down to the surface of the glacier below.

   From appearances, it looks like this was once a rather important
natural phenomenon. The area at the base of the waterfall has been
beaten down by a great force, and would make a pretty good start on
a bottomless pit. There are also many large rocks which have been
worn smooth by the onrushing water. Now, on the other hand, the
waterfall has been reduced to a small stream which barely makes it
over the top and hardly reaches the rocks below. With the water
mostly gone, a cave has been revealed which can be scrambled into

in several unique ways. There are holes around the perimeter of the
rock of about the right size to insert poles for torches, flags, or
perhaps something more elaborate. A hollowed out section could be
used as some kind of basin. Down the middle of the rock are four

  The land buckles here, forming a long strip of high land which
falls off steeply on both sides. The land to the south is a bit
more navigable, there being a well marked trail there. To the
north, however, there is a drop-off which can be scrambled down,
but a way back would be most uncertain. At the bottom is a
massive glacier, flowing west and bounded by the ridge and more
mountains to the north.

out by someone, or something, intelligent. The walls are a bit moist
and the air is cold. Whether these conditions are inviting or
threatening is up to the individual and none other.

   Four smooth, slick walls rising up a fair distance form this
room, which appears to have had use as storage at one point - maybe
for humans, other creatures, or just piles of crates. There is a
hole in the west wall which is evidently not part of the original
design, and slippery steps have been built in one wall, which lead
up.

   This is a large, open space, apparently used for ceremonies of
some sort. Purple tapestries are hung in alcoves in the walls of
the cavern and chains are draped between stalactites handing from
the ceiling. A glorified altar is on a raised platform east of
here and stairs through an archway to the north lead up to a viewing
gallery. Once upon a time, there was a grating covering up a pit in
the center of the room, but it has been ripped off its hinges and
is missing. There are steps carved in the wall of the pit which
allow a safe descent downward.

   This somewhat neglected structure must be "Xexos's Supply Emporium," for
so a little sign on its door proclaims.  There is not much to look at, from
the exterior, except for a few small, sickly-looking flowers here and
there.  The shanty seems on the verge of collapsing at any moment, yet
must be at least a decade or two old.
   A small path leads into the forest to the south.

   Various bric-a-brac clutters the interior of this shanty, resting on
three-legged tables, broken chairs, or the dirt floor itself.  Clearly, this
Xexos places value on function over form.  Perhaps it would be better not
to judge on appearances.

   Apparently Xexos's activities have been less than benign.  Racks of
vials and other strange apparatus decorate the room.  Roots dangle from
the ceiling, drizzling dirt.  A stone slab dominates the center of the
room, with various straps and gizmos attached.  A wooden ladder in one
corner leads upwards.

One is some sort of mechanical device, with silvery gears.  Another is a

The slab is made of some dark grey, very solid-looking stone.  It appears
unmovable.

&+LBy The Underground &+bPool&N~
   Steam rises from the small pool of water in this hollowed out
room. The water looks remarkably clear and healthy, which may be
a result of the impurities being boiled out. A passage leads out
to the west.

   It is very hot in here, a fact which could be explained by the hot
springs and bubbling pools of lava in here. A stone passage leads away
to the east. The cavern extends west, where the floor gives way and
an occasional flame appears.

   Below this spot is a descending chasm into the depths of the earth
where lava gurgles up constantly, and fires spark themselves into a
brief, yet dramatically fierce, existence. There is a strong smell of
sulfur here. There are safe places to walk to the west and east, in
addition to a ledge in the north wall of the cavern.

   Lava gurgles up in wave after wave, the retching of the earth. It
then slides down the rough and creased walls, not quite hardening as
it reaches into the warmth of the pool, bubbling and burning up the
precious oxygen. Flames flicker up and around randomly, with wild
abandon, careless of life.

   This little place seems to be built for someone who normally
prefers to fly rather than stand, as there is hardly any place
to rest any feet, or other appendages.

   The walls of the cavern here are rough, and the ceiling is low,
so that most people would have to bend over some while standing.
There doesn't seem to be any way out except over the lava pool to
the east.
