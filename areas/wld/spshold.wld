&+BThe Open Ocean&n~
&+B   The ocean spreads out in all directions here, leading off to all
&+Bplaces throughout the world.  Most normally, ships coming and going from

&+LThe &+rStronghold&+y Pier&n~
&+y   This pier has been designed especially for the orc juggernaught that
&+ysails between here and the city of &+WSto&+Lrm&+b Port&+y.  The rows of tightly
&+ywrapped logs anchored by old iron&+L anvils&+y are fitted perfectly enough
&+yto allow the juggernaught amble room to dock.  Over the years this pier
&+yand indeed the the outpost &+rstronghold&+y as well has grown considerbly
&+yresulting in the more commercial and civilian uses of this dock.&n

&+wThe &+rStronghold&+w Central &+yPathway&n~
&+y   The &+rstronghold&+y outpost begins here for those just disembarking
&+yfrom the ocean going vessels.  Just off to the northeast a towering
&+Cwatch&+ctower&+y rises high above the rest of the camp.  Heading back to
&+ythe west, the monsterous juggernaught floats in the shallows waters
&+yof the bay.  The regular orc guards wander about the area, keeping
&+ypeace in any way possible.&n

&+y   The pathway forks northwest and northeast here as the small
&+ywalkway that circles around the watchtower begins.  The &+Cwatch&+ctower&n
&+yis a vital part of the outpost as it acts as a primary lookout
&+yoverseeing the entire expanse of ocean and plains in all directions.
&+yAlso, the Board of Orcish Structures will never label an outpost
&+ya &+rstronghold&+y without having at least one structure over two
&+ystories.&n

&+yJust to the south lies a large open field that has been clearned for

&+yGates&+w of the &+LOutpost &+rStronghold&n~
&+y   The gates of this orcish outpost are nothing more than a series
&+yof sharp sticks pointing up from the earth.  The row of these spears
&+ycontinues in a half circle for the entire proximity of the camp. It
&+yis rather an unflattering defensive construction but it serves its
&+ypurpose quite well.  Charging into the camp by the enemy could result
&+yin rows upon rows of impaled mounts and soldiers while the orcs
&+ybehind the wall of spears we need not barely lift a weapon. Of course
&+ya perfect defensive victory only works so well in theory and all
&+ythe orcs know if the outpost is attacked they will all be fighting
&+yhard to defend it.&n

&+yA Boarding Ramp&n~
&+y   This is the boarding plank that leads to the deck of the jugger-
&+ynaught, currently in dock for both resupplying and exchange of crew.
&+yAfter a long time at sea, this mammoth ship will usually stay in harbour
&+yfor around a week or two, before setting sail again.  The dock of
&+ythe outpost is just to the north.&n

&+yOnboard the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean &+cDri&+Cft&+cer&n~
&+y   The deck of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean &+cDri&+Cft&+cer&+y is a long, narrow, stretch of
&+yplanks, several inches thick with each level held together with
&+yhalf a dozen &+Lnails&+y.  It's built much sturdier than an average ocean
&+ygoing vessel as the wieght of both the left and right &+Wsails&+y and
&+ythe huge, leather balloon that is used to keep the ship airborne.
&+yA small ladder leads to the &+whelm&+y below the main deck here where
&+ythe captain steers the ship.&n

&+yOnboard the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean &+cDri&+Cft&+cer&n~
&+y   The deck of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean&+c Dri&+Cft&+cer&+y continues here, built with
&+ythe same sturdy craftsmanship as the rest of the ship.  This
&+yvessel, owned by the &+LSoldiers of &+YFortune&+y, can normally travel
&+yaround the world in just a matter of days, depending on the stops
&+yit makes.  Several of the major cities do not allow the &+cDri&+Cft&+cer&n
&+yto dock due to the ship's all races allowed policy.  Still, the
&+cDri&+Cft&+cer&+y is sometimes the only way to reach otherwise next to
&+yimpossible reach places around the world.&n

&+cStern&+y of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean&+c Dri&+Cft&+cer&n~
&+y   This is the stern-rear-of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean &+cDri&+Cft&+cer&+y.  Strong,
&+ythick &+Lcables&+y that run along either sides of the ship raise up
&+yand encircle the massive, inflated balloon, here.  Tugging on the
&+Lcables&+y is enough proof of the near indestructability of the
&+yvessel as niether the guard rails nor the balloon the &+Lcables&+y are
&+yconnected to budge in the slightest.  While in motion, a look
&+ydown over the rails can cause vertigo quite easily.&n

&+wHelm&+y of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean&+c Dri&+Cft&+cer&n~
&+y   This is the &+whelm&+y of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean &+cDri&+Cft&+cer&+y.  It is basically a
&+yfair sized under carriage of the main deck completely overrun with
&+Lcables&+y, pullies, winches, and other gnomish gadgets used to steer
&+ythe ship.  With a turn of the wheel to the left or right a cable
&+ywould pull the left and right rudder sails causing the direction
&+ychange.  This is truely one of wonders of the world.  The captain
&+ychanges often, but is always a trained member of the &+LSoldiers of
&+YFortune&+y.  The front of the under carriage is left open for
&+ycomplete visibility while steering.&n

&+yRight&+c Rudder&+y of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean&+c Dri&+Cft&+cer&n~
&+y   Both the left and right &+Wsail&+y rooms are fairly identical.  The
&+Wsails&+y on either side are used to change the direction of the ship
&+ywhile the central, main &+Wsail&+y, beneath the helm, is used to give
&+ythe vessel momentum.  Since the &+Wsails&+y on either side of the ship
&+yact much like oars on a rowboat, these sails and considered the
&+yrudders of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean &+cDri&+Cft&+cer&+y and are operated by the captain
&+yat the helm through a series of cables and pullies.  As the
&+yowners of this vessel, the &+LSoldiers of &+YFortune&+y, are determined
&+yto stay neutral in the racewar and allow both sides to use
&+ythe ship, the &+Wlawful&+y and the &+Lchaotic&+y must be separated. This,
&+ythe right side, is where the races of &+Levil&+y remain.

&+cBow&+y of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean&+c Dri&+Cft&+cer&n~
&+y   Though the deck of the &+WEm&+Ypy&+wrean &+cDri&+Cft&+cer&+y ends here, the &+Lcables&n
&+ythat run along the length of the ship on guardrails stretch outward
&+yeven further to envelop the leather balloon and secure it tightly.
&+yThe balloon is nearly three times as long as hull of the ship,
&+yand is heated by several huge torches that are located near the
&+whelm&+y of the ship but unaccessable by all but authorized personnel.
&+yFrom this vantage point, one can see the general direction the
&+yship is moving in at the impressive speed.&n

&+rInside the Furance&n~
&+r   Why would anyone normal enter a coal furance? It is very cramped,
&+rextremely hot, and there seems to be some sort of rather angry, nasty
&+rcreature here in with you.   Though the strange, flaming creature isn't
&+rdoing anything aggressive, it is taking up a lot of space in this closed
&+rquarters area.&n

&+yand still a sizeable portion of the walls missing, it doesn't seem
&+yto be of much use at the moment.&n

&+LOnboard an Orcish &+yJuggernaught&n~
&+y   The main walk way on the juggernaught has been mounted with several
&+yballista stations, each capable of doing severe damage to vessels
&+yapproaching the starboard or port sides of the massive warship.
&+yHowever, due too the extreme work involved in reloading these weapons
&+ywith the &+csteel-tipped&+y bolts, refire time is quite slow.  The loading
&+yand unloading area of the juggernaught&+y is here, where passengers and
&+yinfantry can disembark or enter to the north.  Previously, the lower
&+yhull of the ship was designated for the military only and no civilians
&+ywere allowed onboard.&n

&+ythere, whether it be awake and steering the ship or sleeping.&n

&+yThe Bridge&n~
&+y   The bridge is almost completely self-contained.  As well as all
&+ythe steering of juggernaught and navigations plotted here, it also
&+yserves as quarters for the &+Lcaptain&+y and the &+Wfirst mate&+y.   Crewmen
&+yconstantly run back and forth from the slave gallows and the bridge,
&+ydispatching orders from the &+Lcaptain&+y such as the current rowing
&+yspeed or direction.  The wheel for steering is quite large, as tall
&+yas the &+Lcaptain&+y himself, who is even quite large for an &+Lorc.&n

&+LStern of the Orcish &+yJuggernaught&n~
&+y   The stern of the ship is also quite broad like the bow, again most
&+ylikely used for ramming other vessels.  On the deck here is huge, swival,
&+ycatapult&+y for flinging burning pitch at enemy ships within range.  The
&+ypitch, consisting mostly of tar and iron fragments can set a &+rflame&+y other
&+yships almost instantly and kill many crewmen with the shrapnel.  The
&+Lanchor&+y of the juggernaught also hangs of the starboard side here, a
&+yhuge bulk of iron, heavy enough to bring this monolithic vessel to
&+ya halt.&n

&+LBow of the Orcish &+yJuggernaught&n~
&+y   The bow of this monsterous vessel is quite broad, perhaps to be used
&+yfor crippling other ships through ramming.  Perhaps even to open up
&+yupon beach landings and let the infantry out during invasions.  It
&+yis sealed up now, however, and no infantry are station below deck,
&+yonly slaves and crewmen.  From this point of the ship all of the
&+yforward ocean is visible, offering a better lookout than even that
&+yon the bridge.&n

&+yInside the Hull of the &+yJuggernaught&n~
&+y   Below deck on the juggernaught&+y is just as impressive as above. It
&+ydoes lack the openness of latter, however, the sheer ammount of timber
&+yand iron used to build the outer and inner hull of this vessel is just
&+yas impressive as watching the &+bocean&+y roll by.  The momentum of the
&+yship comes from down here when the sails are down through the use
&+yof slave rowers.  A evil looking &+Lorc&+y watches his captives here,
&+ypossibly pondering which one to whip first, then which one to whip
&+ysecond.&n

&+yThe Slave Gallows&n~
&+y   Below deck is where the majority of the ships movement is created,
&+ythrough the help of numerous slaves.  Two rooms long, holes open up
&+yin the sides of the titanic ocean going vessel, just large enough for
&+ytoars to pass through.  These oars are used by the slaves in a steady
&+yrhythm to keep the ship moving in the desired direction.  The rhythm
&+yis kept up by an exceptionally evil &+Lorc&+y who beats a drum repeatly,
&+yand, in times of slaves acting out of line, whips his captives into
&+ysubmission.
