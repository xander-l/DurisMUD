&+wceiling up and the walls are covered in &+ywooden panels.   &+wThere are 12 panels
&+win all, each panel depicts a &+gwood elf &+wheroically fighting hoards of &+Lorcs.  &+wAn
&+wunnatural &+Ldarkness &+wfills the air that seems to intensify as the tunnel

&+Lorcish leader &+wand his guards.  Though the &+ydoor &+wis only made of &+ywood, &+wit seems
&+wto have a great strength to it.  It almost seems alive and pushes back against

&+mBefore the Royal Crypt~
&+w   This tunnel slopes downward leading from the main hall to the &+Lcrypt &+wof the
&+mking.  &+BWater &+wtrickles slowly down the tunnel where it disappears into the
&+Ldarkness &+wthat gathers before the &+Lcrypt.  &+yWood panels &+wline the walls, each
&+wdepicts a different triumph in the &+mkings &+wlife, from the kill of his first
&+Ggoblin &+wto the kill of his final &+Lorc.  &+wA &+ylarge coffin &+wrests just in front of the
&+Lcrypt.

&+mThe Royal Crypt~
&+w   The walls, floor, and ceiling of this room are composed of 5 slabs of &+Wwhite
&+Wmarble &+wand an &+yornately carved wooden door.  &+wIt is barely large enough to hold
&+wthe &+yhardwood coffin &+wthat rests here.  Strangely, no smell of death or decay
&+wfills the room.  Only the fragrant scent of &+yfreshly cut wood &+wand the odors of
&+wsomething &+gliving.

&+LDown the Drain~
&+L   This narrow tunnel has been carved in the &+ysoft rock &+Lto allow &+Bwater &+Lto drain
&+Lfrom the room above.  It's walls are slick with &+Bwater &+Lmaking movement here
&+Ltreaturous at best.  There is an unnatural darkness to this room that seems to
&+Lintensify as the tunnel continues upward.
