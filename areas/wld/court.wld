&+yA Cliff near the &+BWat&n&+berf&+Ball&n~

This narrow cliff is just west of the great &+Bwat&n&+berf&n&+Ball&n&+y made from the ancient ice within the glaciers nearby. There is no canopy from the trees here, just a perfect &+caz&+Bur&n&+ce&n&+y sky without a cloud in sight. The sound of the water is quite soothing and relaxing, and is the only sound that echoes along the top of this mountain.&n

&+c   This is a turbulent area of the waterfall's final pond, and overshelming currents churn up the water in the area. The force of the waterfall down into the pool below has made this pool quite deep.&n
