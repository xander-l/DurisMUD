&+La &+rf&+Rr&+re&+Rn&+rz&+Ry&+L. Sheets of &+Cice &+Lcascade down the sides of the monsterous cavern
&+Land create several large shelves where a faint &+Wir&+Cri&+Wde&+Wsc&+Cen&+Wt &+Lshimmer can
&+Lbe seen at times. A thick, unnature &+cfog &+Lrolls through the cavern, then
&+Lquickly followed by an abrasive &+Wsnow &+Lstorm that nearly knocks you off
&+Lyour feet. Around the room, giant stalgmites and stalagtites of pure
&+Cice &+Lrise and fall with a deadly chill. Upon the huge walls, various
&+Lsmaller tunnels seem to have been carved into the &+Cice&+L, and look like
&+Lthey could be smaller &+wlairs &+Lfor some of the dragons native to this
&+Ltype of extreme &+bcold&+L. Admist the brutal &+Wsnow &+Lstorm, the forms of
&+Lthe ancient &+Wwhite &+Ldragons seem to take shape as they lounge around
&+Lin their &+Cfrozen &+Lwasteland of a lair. On the southern side of the

&+LAn &+gOve&+yrgr&+gown &+LCavern of &+mA&+Ln&+mc&+Li&+me&+Ln&+mt &+GF&+go&+Gr&+ge&+Gs&+gt&n~
&+L   Before you lies a giant cavern set within the massive tunnels
&+Lthat make up the Caverns of the A&+rz&+Lh&+ru&+Lr&+ra&+Ll Mountains. Layed out upon
&+Lthe floor of this massive cavern is an ancient &+Gf&+go&+Gr&+ge&+Gs&+gt &+Lthat looks
&+Lto be thousands of years old. Huge trees rise up to nearly three
&+Lhundred feet into the air. Thick foliage coveres huge sections of
&+Lthe floor while heavy &+ggreen &+Lvines seem to have wrapped around many
&+Ltree's and woven into the thick upper mantle of the trees. Spaced
&+Laround the cavern is a thick &+cstream &+Lof &+bwater &+Lthat &+cpools &+Lfrom the
&+bwate&+Brf&+ca&+Cl&+Wl &+Lthat cascades down from the western wall of the A&+rz&+Lh&+ru&+Lr&+ra&+Ll
&+LCa&+wve&+Lrn wall. The stream winds its way through the &+gdense &+ywoods &+Land
&+Lpast a large field of what looks to be giant &+mmushrooms &+Lbefore it
&+Lturns and drops into a thin passage in the eastern ca&+wve&+Lrn wall.
&+LThick patches of ground seemed to have been recently layed flat,
&+Las if the form of a huge create was resting nearby recently.
&+L   Deep within the &+ma&+Ln&+mc&+Li&+me&+Ln&+mt &+Gf&+go&+Gr&+ge&+Gs&+gt&+Gs&+L, it looks as if several large
&+Ldragons have carved out deep lairs within several of the &+cenc&+Chan&+cted
&+Ltrees. Faint shadows seem to move about as you look towards these
&+Llairs and see massive &+rarchways &+Lcarved within the trunks. &+cEnc&+Chan&+cted
&+Gv&+yi&+Gn&+ye&+Gs &+Land &+gfoliage &+Lseems to have grown around the lairs and guard
&+Lthem while the dragons rest.&n
