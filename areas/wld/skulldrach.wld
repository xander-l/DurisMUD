&+LEntrance to a Dark Shadow Grove~
   &+gTo the north lies the grove of shadows.  Giant grey trees are all that can
&+gbe seen through the thick shadows.  A great sense of both power and menace
&+gpermeates the surrounding area.  A small path leads north into the shadows
&+gand back down the staircase to the landing.

&+gahead. Strange sounds of moaning and growling come from all directions.
&+gAll exits lead into shadows, easily confusing any hapless traveler of

&+LA Small Clearing in the Shadow Grove~
   &+gThis is a small cleaing in the shadow grove.  There is charred grass
&+gunderfoot, and there are signs of a fire here and there.  It seems almost as
&+gif plant life shuns this spot.  The shadowy mist hovers all around, obscuring
&+gyour view into the grove.  A small path leads north over a bridge to a
&+gtowering structure.  All other exits are shrouded in shadowy mist.

&+gA Forest Trail~
   &+yThis is a well beaten down path within a thickly forested region,
&+ythe trees too close together off the path to fit between. Here, the
&+ypath is sloping downward from the north to the south. There is also
&+ya lesser used trail headed east.  To the west, the trail meets a wide

&+GA Clearing~
   &+gYou find yourself in a clearing surrounded by tightly packed evergreens and
&+gdense bushes. The meadow grass here is thick, lush and dotted with many types
&+gof wild flowers. Larks and thrushes call to and fro from within their cleverly
&+ghidden nests. The atmosphere is one of peace, and you wish you had more time
&+gto sit and ponder on life's philosophies.
   &+gTo the west, it seems the trees may be wide enough to squeeze your way
&+gthrough. To the north and east, juniper bushes speckled with red berries bar
&+gpassage. To the south, the trees are much too dense to penetrate.

&+YA Small Landing~
   &+yThis is a small, beach-type landing for small crafts.  There stands before
&+yyou a large island with very steep walls.  There is a staircase carved into
&+ythe side of the island which leads up to the top of the island.  Looking up
&+yto the top of the staircase, there is what seems to be an opening into some
&+ybushes of some sort.
