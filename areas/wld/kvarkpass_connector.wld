&+yA Narrow Mountain Pass&n~
    This mountain pass carves its way into Kvark's Divide, a massive
set of mountains that keeps the undead and evil lands apart.  This
trail, though narrow, looks heavily used.  There is enough room for
several people to walk side by side, but rock face is very steep and
slippery.  If anyone wants to cross these mountains, this is the trail
they must follow.  The base of the trail is muddy, slowly eroding away
at the occaisonal flow of rain water and the frequent trickles of blood
from slain creatures.

&+bBefore a Pool&n~
    The muddy trail comes to an abrupt end at a mountain
pool.  This pool is surrounded by steep smooth rock. The
mountain trail can be seen to the south.  Immediately to
the north is an odd fish-like symbol that has been carved
into the rock face.  The pool itself is not crystal-clear,
but deep-blue, almost black.  The shoreline is quickly lost
from sight, and the depth of the pool is indeterminable, but
one could swim down.

&+B no other exits.  The entire area is dark, extremely dark.  There
&+Bare a few fish swiming, and many others that are dead floating
&+Bdownstream.  The bed of this waterway is like a gravel in a pitch-black

    The mountain trail ends here as it opens up
to a wide flat area on the mountain named the BloodFields.
This battle field is named for its constant battles between
the undead and the evil races of Duris.  The area is just
littered with corpses.  Skeletons rest at the edge of the
rocks near the end of the trail, an omen to all who enter
this area.

&+mA Guard Post&n~
   This cavern is a about thirty feet in diameter and has
one soul purpose: a guard house for a drow scout.  The drow
scout guards access to a tunnel that leads up and is locked
with a trapdoor.  The trapdoor is solid dolomite and is
virtually indestructable.  The guard house is very simple:
a small ledge where the drow sleeps, usually with the
protection of some sort of invisiblity spell, a few barrels
of food and water collected from the river, and some fishing
spears to catch sharks from the river.

some weird earthen material, perhaps magical in nature.
The walls of the tunnel are rigid, the work of duergars
that were in a hurry.  Some of the more jagged areas of
the tunnel are bloodstained, as if injured people slid
down this tunnel, fleeing from a horrible battle.

&+rBefore a Statue of Kvark&n~
    This statue has been carved into the mountain side
quite some time ago.  Originally a dark marble, it is now
caked in blood from the battles that occur in this area.
Piles of bones are scattered about the area, probably the
remains of skeletons that have been slain.  The statue of
Kvark is magnificent and visible to anyone on the battle
field.  At the best of the statue is a plaque that reads
"King of MetaGrunka."  A small handle can be seen near the
statue's base.

    This misty cave is illuminated with torches mounted
on the walls.  However, the mist prevents people from
seeing where a cave wall ends or where a turn is made,
making it very easy to get lost in this area.  Large
foot steps echo through the cave like a whipser in the
night. The floor is cool and smooth to the touch, a
well-known indication that this area is well traveled.
This cave has been turned into a home, and there is a

    The mountain trail ends here as it opens up
to a wide flat area on the mountain named the BloodFields.
This battle field is named for its constant battles between
the undead and the evil races of Duris.  The area is just
littered with corpses.  Skeletons rest at the edge of the
rocks near the end of the trail, an omen to all who enter
this area.

   This gloomy mountain trail has a large rock canopy
covering most of the trail.  This canopy leaves this trail
in shadow for most of the day, save for one hour in the very
late afternoon.  The rocks in this area are very jagged, and
while a humanoid could not scale them, animals might.  Foot
prints can be seen quite clearly in the loose-gravel floor
of the trail, and animal claws have left scratches in many
parts of the rock face.

while a humanoid could not scale them, animals might.  Foot

of the trail, and animal claws have left scratches in many

&+LA Pitch-Black Cave&n~
   This burnt-out cave was magically created long ago
as the last refuge before the battle field.  There are
numerous corpses rotting around the room and the stench
is unbareable to the living.  The room is large enough
to house a well sized raiding group, and some resting
areas have been carved out into the cave's wall.  A
pool of blood has collected in the back of the cave.

is solid granite with few hand holds if one lost their

    The trail comes to an abrupt end here where
the supporting cliff side has collapsed.  A long
time ago, a rope bridge was once erected her for
people to cross.  However, the bridge did not
stand the test of time and only the posts in
the ground and broken ropes remain.  Far below
shattered boards and a couple of decayed skeletons
can be seen.

    A small alcove in the cavern stretches west of
the bank of the river.  The area is filled with purple
and pink mushrooms.  Insect life is abundant here,
feeding off the water and the mushrooms.  A few areas
of mushrooms have been pushed down, as if someone
was sitting here recently.  The west wall of the
cavern has an abundant amount of mushrooms growing on
it, yet none growing on the floor of the cavern.  It
is as if this was a well traveled area.

the looks of the area, this is a duergar settlement
that was originally started by a group of duergar miners
who had helped finish off the tunnels around the
underground river.  Two large duergar gate guards are
posted here to keep unwelcomes out.

is little more than a roughly dug out tunnel.  It is
very apparent that the duergar miners are still in

However, due to the proximity to the BloodField and
the undead races of the world, the deurgars are often
dropping their work and running to battle as shown
by the many mining tools lying at the road side.

    This domicile is the home to a duergar miner.
The room is little more than a dug out side of the tunnel
with some purple worm hide strewn together to act as
the door.  A small bed of furs is in the corner as a
resting place.  There are a few ceramic bowls used for
retrieving food and water.

&+mOpening to a Shaft&n~
    The tunnel ends here to a large opening of
a vertical shaft.  The shaft leads downwards
towards the underdark.  A stench rises from the
shaft, and noises can be heard on occasion.  The
entire area is blanketed in a pitch-black darkness.

&+rEntryway to the Outpost of &+WClan Shatter Stone&n~
    The entryway to the outpost is seemingly plain
indeed.  The entryway is little more than a large
vertical shaft with a platform that stretches across
to the entryway guard house. Attached to the center
of the platform is a ladder that goes both up and
down.  Additionally, stairs have been carved into the
walls of the shaft, creating a spiral stair case.

entryway.  A fair number of guards are coming
and going from this point at any given time.  A
large round table is situated in the center of
the room, mostly for the guards to rest their
mugs of ale.  There are a few chairs in the area,
and the guard post has a fine view of the entryway.

the second echelon, or lieutenants of the clan.
The main spiral staircase and ladder continue up,
and the main entryway level is down below.  The
only other exit is to the west, where a faint fire
is usually burning.

of the clan.  This is where the lieutenant will brief his
soldiers in case of an invasion of undead.  The doors to
the bararcks are to the north, while the liuentant has
his residence to the west.  The outpost's tactication has
a study area to the south.  There is a fire pit in the center
of the room.

   The barracks is a very minimal set of stacked
bunk beds, many without any furs for comfort, all
jammed into one lengthy tunnel-like room.  The good
part about the barracks is that there is a small
underground waterfall that has been exposed to
be used by the troops.  A fair amount of soldiers
can be found in the barracks at any given time.

by the settlement's defenses.  In the center of the room
is a large desk and chair.  There is a small bed in the
far corner of the room behind a proped-up skeleton of
a death knight.  There are a few shelves around the
room, stacked with various armor and weapons that the
lieutenant likes to use.

&+LThe Tactician's Room&n~
    This room serves both the purpose of an office
and the home of the duergar tactician for the outpost.
It is rumored that the tactician is responsible for
finding the shaft in the underdark that lead up to
this area.  Many battle charts, maps, and other
drawings are strung up all about the room.  The
common mechanism for these pictures is by using a
charcoal paste on a stretched hide.  In fact, there
is both a hide stretching rack in this room and back
in the war room.

    This is the throme room of Glonvx, the duergar
commander.  Glovnx was a former lieutenant in Clan
Shatter Stone, as noted by his old uniform hung on
the wall.  As a Commander, Glonvx has lead this Clan
to victory in its new outpost and in doing earned
himself a throne room.  The throne room looks like it
is made of complete smooth stone.  The actual throne
itself appears to be obsidian.

    The basement of the outpost is a heavily guarded
entrance into a maze of caverns.  Guards speak of rumors
about the passage back to the Underdark, however not many
of the duergars can lead the way.  A large boulder is
errected at the entrance to block pasage into the tunnels
to the west.  There is a small storage area and guard post
to the north.

have tried to expand this passageway.  It looks like
these efforts have not been completed since the passage
is still single file.

of mist float through the cavern, giving the illusion of
clouds above a very high cavern ceiling.

&+mA Large Cavern of &+YRothe Fields&n~
    This cavern contains fields of various mushrooms
and fungi that the rothe have come to love.  The duergar
of the nearby outpost can be seen harvesting these rothes
for food.  The only other nearby source of food are the
small sharks and fish in the underground river.  There
are various mushroom trees that have survived the rothes
ravage and are growing quite tall in the cavern.  Pockets
of mist float through the cavern, giving the illusion of
clouds above a very high cavern ceiling.

A thick green slime covers most of the cavern, producing a horrible smell
that resembles rotting plants.  The cavern continues back to the south.
