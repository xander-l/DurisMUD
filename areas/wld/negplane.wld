&+LA Flat Expanse~
&+L   This portion of the forest has absolutely no trees -- it is a flat
&+Lexpanse that has been cleared of all undead creatures...
&+LSomething is obviously different here.

&+yA Dusty Plot of Land~
&+y   Although still very, very cold this bit of land is unlike any other on
&+ythe Negative Material Plane.  This earth consists of packed, bone-chilling
&+ydust -- dust finer than even the finest sand.  Perhaps there is a way out
&+yof the Plane of Entropy nearby...

&+LThe Vast Forest of the Negative Material Plane~
&+L   This vast expanse of forest resembles a forest of the prime material plane
&+Lin many aspects, but the vegitation grows at odd angles, and everything
&+Lseems to be somehow shriveled, and yet, at the same time thriving.
&+LThe forests of the prime material plane are a balance between the positive
&+Land the negative but this place reeks of dark power -- the very power of
&+Lunmaking, which somehow has its own organization that allows a meaningful
&+Lstate of life that is actually death... some have called it undeath...
&+LThese forests only have the darker, more chaotic elements of what one might
&+Lcall life.  And the trees arent the only thing "alive" here...

&+LThe Vast Forest of the Negative Material Plane~
&+L   This vast expanse of forest resembles a forest of the prime material plane
&+Lin many aspects, but the vegitation grows at odd angles, and everything
&+Lseems to be somehow shriveled, and yet, at the same time thriving.
&+LThe forests of the prime material plane are a balance between the positive
&+Land the negative but this place reeks of dark power -- the very power of
&+Lunmaking, which somehow has its own organization that allows a meaningful
&+Lstate of life that is actually death... some have called it undeath...
&+LThese forests only have the darker, more chaotic elements of what one might
&+Lcall life.  And the trees arent the only thing "alive" here...

&+LOver a Massive, Misty Chasm~
&+L   Below is a chasm that leads deep into the ground, so deep that the end
&+Lis not in sight.  Perhaps this is the gateway to the center of power of
&+Lthis plane.

&+LThe Shadowy Cave Widens~
&+L   The shadowy cave seems to open up into a big open cavern room here.
&+LThe shadows seem to move about and act strangely.  It would seem as if
&+LThere was something .. alive... here.. Or perhaps its just an alien
&+Lenvironment interacting in strange ways with a mortal mind...

&+L   This appears to be the center of this odd pocket in the cave.  A hideous
&+Lbile filled pool, that reaks of poison and decay, is in the middle, and
&+La hair-raising, ominous trickle can be heard from above into the pool.
&+LOccasionaly the trickle speeds up, and splashes fluid all over...

&+LStart of a Sparkling Black Cave~
&+L   This cave seems somewhat out of place.  The air is purer than most of
&+Lthe air of this plane, and the walls give off a faint glow, that seems
&+Lrather out of place here.  A slight smell of ozone permeates the air,
&+Lleading one to suspect that perhaps the energy-sensitive air of the
&+LNegative Material Plane is being subjected to extraplanar magical stresses.

&+LIt could be five feet, it could be five miles.  There is no way to tell

&+LAt the Base of the Chasm~
&+L   Although the chasm seems to end here, the passage slants down to the
&+Least, opening up into a giant cave.  It would seem that this is not the
&+Lcenter of the plane, even though its obvious this is near.
&+LDark energies crackle about here, and occasionaly a bit of pure air
&+Lappears spontaneously.  It would seem that there is a slight planar overlap
&+Lhere.

&+LStart of the Cave of the Dragons of Negative Energy~
&+L   Dragons, one of the most powerful beasts of Duris when living, are also
&+Lquite powerful when undead and thriving off the energies of this plane.
&+LOnly one type of mortal Dragon, the Shadow Dragon, can thrive on The
&+LNegative Material Plane, in addition to Dracoliches and Skeletal Dragons.

&+LThe floor continues to drop, and the passage goes closer and closer to
&+Lthe center of the plane.  The roars of skeletal dragons can be heard all
