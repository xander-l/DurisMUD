&+YA Well Traveled Path&N~
&+y   Six sets of flagpoles have been meticulously spaced and embedded
&+yalong each side of the cobblestone path leading up to a massive gate.
&+yEach pole supports either a large banner emblazoned with Newhaven's
&+ycrest or a white scale and balance.  The roadway has been formed from
&+ytiny dark brown stones and has been mortared tightly together.  The
&+yarea is very picturesque.  The lush green landscape of the area
&+yis offset by the vibrant colors of the many wild flowers that have
&+ysprouted about the flagpoles.  The roadway is completely free of any
&+ydebris.
