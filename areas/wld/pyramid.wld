Above the &+LNever&+bWind&n Valley~
   Emerging from a windy mountain trail to the south, this mountain summit
provides a magnificent view of a wide valley spread out to the north. The
large valley is surround on all four sides by a &+Lgrayish&n rock. A large
stone pyramid, apparently constructed from the same rock lies on the far side
of the valley, towards the northern wall. Set out in some sort of formation,
small homes rest in a line to the south of the pyramid. A beautiful &+gevergreen&n
forest fills the southern area of the valley, fitting nicely between the east
and west walls. To the north, the trail briskly twists down the side of the
southern wall. A narrow dirt path extends southwards, heading back into the
mountains.

The Two Walls Meet~
   The western wall ends here, jutting against the western valley wall. The
valley wall has been smoothed and joined to the end of the stone wall
protecting the pyramid. There is almost no seam visible between the the two
walls. Travel to the west and the north is impeded by the large mass of stone,
but the forest continues to the east and to the south.

Against a Large Stone Wall~
   The forest here ends abruptly, as if some invisible force has told the trees
not to grow. A stone wall has been constructed to the north, with the same
care and preciscion as the other structures in this area. The wall is quite
high, and as smooth as glass, fouling even the best thief's scaling attempts.
The forest extends to the south, growing quite dense just after the invisible
line that marks the forest's edge. The wall continues to both the east and the
west, where it approaches the side of the western wall of the valley.

Before a Rusted &+LWrought Iron &NGate~
   A large &+Lwrought iron &Ngate rests just to the north of this area. Attatched to
a stone wall, the gate appears to be the weak link of the defense system.
Years of wind and rain have taken their toll on the gate, which now hangs
precariously from its mountings on the wall by one &+yrusted&n hinge. Beyond the
gate lies the great pyramid and a small cluster of homes surrounding it. The
dense &+gevergreen&n forest is to the south, and the stone wall can be seen

The high city wall ends abruptly here, against the side of the eastern wall of
the valley. Piles of rocks and rubble surround this area, as engineers tried
to form the two walls to meet each other. It appears that the two walls could
not be joined perfectly, as a small hole is evident where the two walls meet.
The walls prevent all travel to the east and to the north, but the city wall
extends to the west. Travel is also possible to the south, where the forest

Deep Inside the &+gPine&n Forest~
   An eerie twilight surrounds this area of the forest. The tall pine trees
block out almost all of the sky with their needle-covered branches. A dense,
&+ggreenish&n-&+ybrown&n moss blankets the earth below. A large tree sits nearby,
with thick, evenly-spaced branches. Maybe someone with enough skill could
climb it. The thick forest appears to lighten a bit to the west, but the other
exits just press on into the foliage.

than in other areas of the valley. The branches at the top of the trees create
a large canopy that covers the sky. This makes for an eerie, twilight state
of the day, and prevents the smaller plants from getting enough light to
grow. The forest seems to get lighter to the east. To the north, the wall
surrounding the town is visible. The dense forest continues to the west and

brush in the forest. The roots of many large pines stick up from the ground
here, fighting for every drop of moisture. The roots cover the path and make

maintained. Rows of books are stacked neatly on wooden shelves against the
wall. A small desk near a perfectly made bed contains stack of sorted &+Wpapers&n.
A large pot sits on &+rfire&n pit in one corner, slowly cooking a meal. Two
lanterns supply all of the light in the room, and rest on the desk in opposite
corners.

Before a Home in a Dense Forest~
   Through a small clearing in this otherwise dense forest lies a small home to
the west. Constucted from the wood of the forest's pines, the home is nestled
snugly between a few of the larger trees. Other than the door to the west,
the forest seems to continue in every direction.

Deep Inside the &+gPine&n Forest~
   An eerie twilight surrounds this area of the forest. The tall pine trees
block out almost all of the sky with their needle-covered branches. A dense,
&+ggreenish&n-&+ybrown&n moss blankets the earth below. A large tree sits nearby,
with thick, evenly-spaced branches. Maybe someone with enough skill could
climb it. The thick forest appears to lighten a bit to the west, but the other
exits just press on into the foliage.

Inside a Large &+gPine&n Forest~
   The forest here becomes rather thick only a few yards away from the trail.
Large &+gpines&n extend upward, blocking off almost all view of the sky.
Different types of bushes and moss cover most of the valley floor, living
on what moisture they can find. The forest appears to grow even more dense to
the west, while a lighter version can be seen to the north and south. The
familiar trail through the forest is visible to the east.

At the Base of a Large Ramp~
   The large ramp comes to an end here, measuring only a few inches thick as
it descends to meet the soft earth of the valley floor. Large &+ywooden&N posts
have been driven far into the earth here. Coils of old and decayed rope
surround the posts, which appear to have been forgotten long ago. The ramp
climbs up the southern wall to the south, and to the north, a small pathway
winds through the forest. The forest lies to both the east and the west.

of larger rocks that have fallen from higher levels up the cliff. Exits to the

the end of any further travel. To the north rests a small wooden cabin, made
from the surrounding &+gpine&n trees. Travel along the western wall is permitted
to the south. To the east lies more of the forest on the valley floor.

   The trees in the forest here have somehow managed to grow closer together
than in other areas of the valley. The branches at the top of the trees create
a large canopy that covers the sky. This makes for an eerie, twilight state
of the day, and prevents the smaller plants from getting enough light to
grow. To the south and the west, the forest seems to lighten up a bit. The
growth does not appear to lighten at all to the east or north.

The eyelets are set evenly every few yards apart on the sides of the ramp.

   The forest here is rather dark and foreboding, due to the dense tree cover
above. Most of the smaller plants don't have enough sunlight to grow here, so
the ground is covered with a thick &+Yyellow&n moss. The branches of one of
the larger &+gpines&n grows close enough to the ground to climb up. Other exits
are to the north and west, which lead father into the forest. To the east and

east. The wall continues to both the north and the south. To the east lies the

have been very tall, for the ceiling hangs far down into the room. The smooth
stone walls surrounding this room are also positioned rather close together, as
if to squeeze adventurers on into the next room. The exits from this area are
to the west and south.

A Wide Path Past the Front Gates~
   The wide path through the forest continues to carry onward after the rusted
gates to the small city. Homes are lined up perfectly on either side of the
road. The homes have no decorations or windows on the outside, making it
difficult to tell the buildings apart from oneanother. The path continues
to the north, past a half dozen or so more homes. The rusted gates lie close
by to the south, and the first examples of the symmetrical homes sit to the
east and west of this location.

Inside a Small Gypsy Home~
   This small gypsy home contains only one large room. The current owners have
partitioned the area into different sections in or to make the place feel
larger. Different &+Msilks&n and &+yfurs&n adorn the walls, evidence of this family's
long trade history. One large group of &+yfurs&n lay in a heap near the corner,
serving as a bed. A small makeshift desk, cut from &+gpine&n is positioned near the
door. The only exit from this home is to the west.

Inside a Small Gypsy Home~
   The architecture of this home appears to be centuries older than the current
practices of homebuilding. Thick stones have been neatly cut and stacked to
form the walls of this small building. Small logs and bark serve as a roof
above the cottage floor. Although the previous residents are nowhere to be
found, it appears that a wandering band of gypsies have inhabited the small
home. Various amenities hang from the wall, and the one room home has been
partitioned into different areas. In the northeast corner, a crudely built
&+rfire&n pit serves as a kitchen and eating area. The western part of the home
serves as a sleeping area, and the eastern part appears to be a place for the
children to play. The only exit lies to the east, back out the small doorway
to the road.

west look meticulously crafted, with each block carved to exact dimensions.
Some type of doorway is visible to the north, in front of the pyramid. Before
the door to the north lie more homes to explore. The path continues on to the
south as well, nearing the gates to this small city.

Inside a Small Gypsy Home~
   This small cottage appears to be too old to have been created by the current
owners. This home has been built from large blocks of &+Lstone&n from the
surrounding valley walls. The gypsys who live here have turned the otherwise
dull block of stone in quite a lavish place. Rare &+Msilks&n and &+rtapestries&n cover
the floor and the walls, hiding most of the cold &+Lstone&n from view. A small pit
of &+rfire&n provides a place to cook food and a source of heat. The exit from this

home does not share the same neatness or structure that the other ones do.
Piles of papers lie in a heap near the corner of the home, and various trinkets
are strewn about all over the floor. A small desk sits near the door to the
home. This desk appears to be the only clean area in this place. Various
scrolls and sheets of vellum are stacked neatly off to one side of the desk,
and a fresh quill and a piece of parchment wait nearby for someone to use them.
The only exit out of this home lies across a stack of papers to the east.

large pyramid to the north. The buildings have been set in symmetrical
fashion, one to a side, at the same distance apart from one another. The
surrounding jungle has been cleared from this area, and nothing seems to grow
on the soft earth surrounding the homes. To both the east and the west lie
examples of the symmetrical homes. Northward, the trail continues on towards
the pyramid. To the south, the trail heads into the forest.

has been nicely decorated with different objects and trinkets that this family
has collected on their various journeys. Large &+Wpolar bear&+y furs&n rest on a small
cot in the corner, providing warmth when the nights get cold. A rack of &+Lstone&n
tipped hunting spears has been placed by the door, and a small circle of rocks
marks out a cooking area for whatever the spears might hit. A small dirt path

On a Path Approaching the Pyramid~
   The path through this group of homes is sectioned off from the rest of the
surrounding dirt by a small line of rocks that make of the east and west side
of the path. It is strange that the rocks are all still neatly in place,
considering that anyone careless enough to step on even one of them would
sink them deep into the earth below. Small homes line either side of the path
here. The homes appear to be made of some type of stone, although it looks
different than the stone that surrounds the valley around you. To the north
lies a large set of doors near the pyramid. To the south lie more homes along
the path.

A desk in the corner and its surrounding shelves do not share the clutter of
objects that were so prevalent in the other homes. The objects that can be
found here appear to be of greater value than the regular junk in other
buildings. Several types of &+Wm&+Bu&+Ws&+Bi&+Wc&+Ba&+Wl&n instruments lie on a workbench just inside

the same type that makes up the surrounding valley. The blocks that make up
this pyramid are extremely large, and &+Wpolished&N smooth on the outer surface.
The seams where two pieces of stone meet have been carefully filled with some
type of material, making them almost invisible. The entrance to the pyramid is
nothing more than a small hole carved in the face of the rock. Before this
entrance stands a marvelously constructed pair of double doors. An intricate
design of a man fighting a large group of beasts adorns the crest of the
doors. Large &+ybrass&n handles have been set into the doors, allowing them to be
opened with ease.

   The trail here is reduced greatly in width, to accomodate a sharp bend
around a polished outcropping of rocks. The drop to the north is extremely
steep, with the valley floor resting almost directly below the path. Any
combat in this area would be difficuly, due to both the cramped conditions
and a lack of proper footing. The trail continues onward to the east, hugging

thousands of years of use. The valley floor is once again visible to the
north. The stone pyramid in the distance seems to have grown larger, as the
distance to it grows shorter. The trail seems to widen a bit to the east,

face. The was obviously not a creation of nature, and appears to have been
constructed from the same rock that surrounds this valley. From this vantage

A Dark and Winding Tunnel~
   Many different clay jugs and pots rest on the floor here, in no particular
order. Small strips of &+Wcloth&n are wound up around a block of &+ywood&n nearby. While
the &+Wcloth&n is in its final state of decay, some type of liquid still resides
in the jars. The passageway continues to the north and the west.

Somewhere on the Third Floor~
   The room stretches out in all directions from this location. There does not
seem to be an end to any corridor. Even the stone pillars are free of marks or
other directions. Both the ceiling and the floor are carved from &+Lblack stone&n,
and are seamlessly attatched to eachother.

A Dark and Winding Tunnel~
   Puddles of &+rdried blood&n cover the floor of this tunnel. It is difficult
to tell how old the blood is, but it isn't fresh, and it hasn't all decayed
either. The victim who left this blood is nowhere to be found. The passageway
contines on to the north and the south.

A Dark and Winding Tunnel~
   The tunnel here is littered with large pieces of what appear to be human
bones. Old, crudely made spears accompany the remains, symbolizing a period in
time thousands of years before this one. The tunnel continues to the east and

wooden torches lies in the corner here, equipment left by either the creators
or another group of weary adventurers. The darkness continues to the south,

&+Lstone&n block into place amongst the other blocks in the pyramid. Another group
of workers can also be seen dragging the next &+Lstone&n down the hill to be put
into place. There are two exits from this room, to the east and to the south.

found its way through even the smallest cracks in the stone. The polished walls
have been roughed up slightly by the &+cdeposits&n left by the water. The

A Dark and Winding Tunnel~
   The slick surface of the stone that surrounds this room contains no traces
of the strange markings present on the doors to the entrance of the Pyramid.
Either the walls are supposed to be devoid of any information, or the creators
ran out of time constucting this huge block of stone. The darkness continues
onward to the west and the east.

The dark rock that comprises this tunnel is polished to a bright shine, and
appears to glow, even in almost complete darkness. A small staircase is here,
rising though the ceiling to the second level of the Pyramid. A small tunnel
also heads to the east.

   This floor closely resembles the second in that large stone columns have
been used to hold up the ceiling every few feet or so. Some sort of spell must
have been cast on this area, because the hallways seem to continue on forever.
The polished &+Lstone&n both on the ceiling and the floor appear to be seamless, as
if they were carved from a giant piece of the valley wall. Each room seems to
look just like the previous one.

   A small stairway rises from the ground here, extending through the ceiling
above. Carved directly from the &+Lstone&n around it, this stairway is the only
object that stands out from the otherwise endless barrage of &+Lcolumns&n. The floor
continues from here, pressing on in every direction.

Somewhere on the Third Floor~
   The room stretches out in all directions from this location. There does not
seem to be an end to any corridor. Even the stone pillars are free of marks or
other directions. Both the ceiling and the floor are carved from &+Lblack stone&n,
and are seamlessly attatched to eachother.

By a Stairway on the Fourth Floor~
   The staircase to the third floor rises out of the smooth stone below. &+BBlue&n
&+Wribbons&n of &+Ylight&n surround each of the four two-dimensional exits from this
room. There appears to be no visible source that is creating the light, it
simply flows around the exits like a thin layer of silk. Although it is
difficult to discern what lies beyond the exits, the ribbons themselves don't
appear to be harmful.

The Artifact Room of &+WDunan&n, the First King~
   This room is filled with all sorts of furniture and equipment that &+WDunan&n
thought that he would need in the afterlife. Beautifully painted pictures on
scrolls of vellum rest here, next to &+Ygolden&n silverware of all shapes and
sizes. Hand decorated ceramic jars and statues rest in a corner of the room.
&+WDunan's&n own thrown, a magnificant spectacle made of &+Ygold&n and &+Wsilver&n, stands
proudly near the east exit. The &+Rred&n carpet on the ground countinues in
circular fashion around this floor.

The Artifact Room of &+GArnlen&n, the Second King~
   This room resembles &+WDunan's&n room in many ways. A large throne, similar
to the first king's but made only of &+Wsilver&n, rests along the northen wall. A
&+ywooden&n bow and quiver of arrors lies discarded near a large rack of &+Larmor&n.
The &+Larmor&n is polished to a very high gloss. While it looks magnificant, it
offers little, if any, real protection. The &+Rred&n carpet continues to complete
its circle around the fifth floor, travelling to the west and south.

On the Fifth Floor of the Pyramid~
   This floor houses a small room for each of the three kings that ruled over
this land. Each king received his own room where he could store all of his
worldly possessions to take with him after he had left this world. Paintings
of all shapes and sizes adorn the walls here, and a beautiful &+Rred&n carpet winds
its way around the floor. The small stone staircase also continues upward from
here, on to the last floor of the pyramid.

The Top of the Great Pyramid~
   This room marks the highest point obtainable in the pyramid. The walls here
are covered with stange markings and paintings that resemble others in the
pyramid. A large &+Lstone&n sarcophagus rests along the northern wall here, set
deep inside the &+Lblack&n rock that forms the wall. The only exit from this room
is back down the dark &+Lstone&n staircase.

A Tunnel Beneath the Pyramid~
   The small tunnel appears to have been deliberately dug below the pyramid,
and not formed by erosion or some other force of nature. The walls and the
floor are composed of a hard, packed &+yearth&n, and are free of writings and
drawings -- unlike the walls above. The cavern continues to slope downward into
the darkness

A Tunnel Beneath the Pyramid~
   The dark tunnel continues to climb downward to some unknown destination.
Trickles of &+bwater&n are now visible, emerging from the soft mud and stone walls,
slowly running down the tunnel into the darkness below. Small patches of
&+rreddish&n moss have started to grow here, living off of the mineral rich &+bwater&n.

A Secret Chamber Beneath the Pyramid~
   This small room has been carved out of the earth beneath the pyramid. Small
blocks of &+Lstone&n have been stacked around the walls, from the floor to the
ceiling to give support to this room. Along the eastern wall rests a large
&+Lstone&n sarcophagus, covered with intricate designs and drawings. The sole exit
from this area is to the west.

A Peaceful Spot Below the Pyramid~
   The trickling &+bwater&n from above comes to rest here, in a small pool at
the bottom of the tunnel. Many different &+Rc&+Bo&+Yl&+Go&+Cr&+Ws&n of moss grow on the rocks
here, adding beauty to the otherwise dull scenery in this area. The tunnel
appears to end here, with the only exit being a steep climb back towards the
pyramid above.
