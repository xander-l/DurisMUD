&+gA Dark Path Through The Forest&n~
&+L  This dark path starts out of a clearing and leads into a large area
&+Lof almost shadow enshrouded woods.  The area seems to feel cool, almost
&+Lto the extent of chilling one's flesh.  Few animals can be seen as the
&+Lpath penetrates deeper into the forest.  On the other hand, there is an
&+Lincreasingly amount of dark shadowy creaters, unidentifiable at this
&+Ldistance, as well as an enormous amount of insects.

&+gThe Turning Point&n~
&+L  The path through this twisted forest comes to a fork here
&+Lwhere one path seems to develop into almost a cobblestone road,
&+Lwhile the other rougher side of the path twists deeper into the
&+Ldark forest.  Towards the west lies the cobblestone footpath while
&+Ltowards the east, the forest thickens and darkens.  Strange noises can
&+Lbe heard in the not-so-distant area, and tracks of several strange
&+Lbeasts can be seen heading eastward.

A Rough Cobblestone Path~
&+y  This rough cobblestone footpath seems to be the only sign of
&+ycomfort and possibly civilization within this dark forest.  Towards
&+ythe east, the path splits, while this cobblestone path makes a slight
&+ybend to the north here.  The stones that create this path aren't very
&+ylarge, but have been well placed.  This path appears to be kept clear
&+yof too much overgrowth.

A Cobblestone Path Through the Forest~
&+y  The cobblestone path takes a slight turn here, heading north and then
&+yfurther towards the west where there appears to be the clearing.  The
&+yforest's undergrowth seems fairly thick all along the path, not allowing
&+ymuch penetration, if any at all.  Towards the south the path continues,
&+ywhile towards the west an inn or some sort of building can be seen in the
&+ydistance.  From time to time, an elven guard appears briefly, but vanishes
&+yjust as quickly, as if he were guarding this path.

The End of the Path~
&+y  The cobblestone path finally comes to a halt as the doors of
&+ythe inn lie towards the west.  To the east, the path continues back into
&+ythe forest.  A pair of elven guards appear to be guarding the entrance,
&+ykeeping whatever is in the forest from getting to the inn.  This inn is
&+yis the one area of peace in this entire forest.  The inn practically takes
&+ytakes up the entire clearing, leaving just the forest and the path.

&+gA Dark Path In The Forest&n~
&+g   The path stretches deeper into the forest here, winding its way
&+gin a northeast direction.  As the path penetrates deeper and deeper it
&+gstarts to fade, until one can barely tell that there is a path here.
&+gThe path continues towards the north here, just visible through the under
&+gbrush and vines.  Towards the west the path is quite visible.  Sounds rarely
&+gheard on this island can be heard within this forest, and specifically they
&+gcan be heard deeper into the forest.

&+gThe Faint Remains Of A Path&n~
&+g  The path is is almost nonexistant here as it fades from being a path
&+gand several avenues of venture open up into the forest.  The area is
&+gblanketted in shadows, leaving it hard to tell if something or someone
&+gis hiding within the forest.  This is the last true remains of the path,
&+gwith only a few landmarks to mark this one spot in the entire forest.
&+gTowards the south, the path continues on normally, while in every
&+gother direction, the forest stretches out.

&+gSomewhere Within Haunted Wood Forest&n~
&+L  The haunted wood forest is rarely ventured into except by the bravest
&+Lof adventurers.  The area is confusing to say the least, and just about
&+Levery turn puts you back into an area similiar to the last.  There are
&+Lvery few landmarks to mark your trail, even when one thinks they have
&+Lfound the trail leading out of the forest, it fades just as quickly and
&+Lthe remain within the haunted wood, where creaters await them.  Sunlight

&+gSomewhere Within Haunted Wood Forest&n~
&+L  The haunted wood forest is rarely ventured into except by the bravest
&+Lof adventurers.  The area is confusing to say the least, and just about
&+Levery turn puts you back into an area similiar to the last.  There are
&+Lvery few landmarks to mark your trail, even when one thinks they have
&+Lfound the trail leading out of the forest, it fades just as quickly and
&+Lthe remain within the haunted wood, where creaters await them.  Sunlight
&+Lcan barely penetrate the forest canopy, and only during peak hours of the
&+Lday at that. The forest continues in all directions.

&+LCaught In A &+mSpider's Web&n~
&+m  A gigantic spider has made this little corner of the forest his home,
&+mand he has spun a gigantic web that he uses to snare all sorts of animals,
&+mand even the occaisional poor traveller who stumbles upon this web. There
&+mare several corpses of such travellers who have come across the web, their
&+mrotting skeletons have been eaten away and sit at the bottom of the web,
&+mmangled and torn.

&+yBefore A Small Hut&n~
&+y  One of the few landmarks within the entire forest, this small hut lies
&+yjust towards the north, and is located on the northern side of the forest.
&+yThe outside of the hut seems rather old and worn down.  It is unclear
&+ywhether or not someone lives here or not, the path leading up to the hut
&+yis slightly worn, but not enough for daily travel.  In addition, the under
&+ygrowth is starting to grow up the side of the hut.  A few rusty spears
&+ylean up against the side of the hut near the door.  The forest continues
&+ytowards the south.

&+LWithin A Dark Hut&n~
   This dark hut is the home of an old orc scout who got stuck raiding
the elf island many years ago.  Fearing for his life, he found the darkest
forest he could find and has made himself a home, hunting the various wild
life in the forest, and trying to avoid the elven patrols.  He seems rather
weak and was probably going to be used as fodder for the raiding group that
left him here so long ago.  His hut is small and dirty with only the bare
essentials for life.

&+yA Dirty Trail&n~
   This dirty trail leads out of the dark portion of the forest and towards
some sort of water source.  A faint sound of a stream or even possibly
a river can be heard in the area.  Towards the west the trail leads deep
into the dark forest.  Towards the north the dirty trail winds itself through
a few boulders and starts heading downward as the contour of the land starts
to slope down a bit.

slope towards some water source, just around the bend up ahead, running
water can be heard.  There are several tracks of humanoid creaters in this
dirty trail.  The trail itself just happens to be the easiest way around
a rocky area where a mudslide must have occured.  Towards the southwest the

and starts to form a valley.

&+yA Sandy Shore&n~
   This is the southern bank of the river.  Several poorly made wooden
canoes have been left here.  The canoes have a definate stink to them,
probably being the property of the gnolls.  The river is moving fast
enough that it requires the use of a boat.  A half-orc traveller has
taken advantage of this situation and actually sells canoes or rafts to
those who need them.

&+bOn A Slow Moving River&n~
   This slow moving river cuts through the forest and then starts to pick
up speed as it digs itself into a canyon.  This particular point on the
river is best suited for crossing because it hasn't picked up much speed
yet.  However, crossing this river requires a boat of some kind that many
travellers choose to buy from the half-orc on the south bank.  Towards
the north the sandy shore can be seen, followed by the entrance to a gnoll
settlement.

&+cBefore Some Poorly-Made Gates&n~
   A pair of poorly made wooden gates stand before a dirty gnoll settlement
here.  This is probably the gnoll settlement that produces the raiding
parties on the elf and centaur towns.  The smell of the gnolls seems to have
gotten into everything and has even appeared to have stained their gates.
Being far from civilization, few elves have found this settlement, yet the
gnolls still feel safer with their poorly-made gates.  The settlement
lies within a gorge, or possibly even a canyon that protects the settlement
on all sides, except this side, with towering cliff faces.

&+cA Dirty Road Through The Settlement&n~
   This dirty road runs right up the middle of the gnoll settlement.
There are a few side trails running off to the sides of the main road,
however this road leads from the gates right up to the tent of the gnoll
chieftan who lives at the northern end of the village.  Directly south of
here lies the poorly-made wooden gates that protect the village.  Towards
the west lies a training camp, while towards the east lies a nursery of
newly born gnolls.

  This is the gnoll nursery where a few female gnolls take care of and
raise the newly born gnolls.  There are rows of beds, which are nothing
more than piles of skins and furs, lined up along the walls of this poorly
built longhouse.  There are usually three or four of the females taking
care of the ten or so babies that this nursery houses.  This longhouse
is made of the same wood from the nearby forest, and most of the planks used
to make this house were made from broken canoes.

&+yA Training Field&n~
  This training field is where the adolescent gnolls come to train.  There
are usually up to four or five of these young gnolls here practicing their
spear throwing and things of that sort, and usually one overseer to make
sure things run smoothly.  Towards west lies the main dirt road through the
settlement.  The training is rather small, considering that this settlement
lies in the center of a small canyon.  The canyon wall can be seen directly
towards the west.

The road runs directly north and south, with the chief's tent at the northern
end, and the gates to the settlement at the southern end.  A very poorly
constructed well lies directly towards the north, while one of the gnoll
top raiders has a home towards the west.  The settlement lies within a small
gorge or canyon, protected on all sides by towering rock.  The only way
into the settlement is through the gates at the southern opening.

&+yWithin A Warrior's Tent&n~
    Few of the gnolls actually get the luxury of living in their own
tents.  Many of them either live outside in the filth, or in a very large
barracks-like tent, which is quite possibly even filthier than the streets
of the gnoll settlement.  However, when a brave gnoll warrior has come back
with a large amount of elven scalps or centaur tails, he is given his own
tent for quite some time.  These tents are nothing special, except that
the warrior has the luxury of living with just himself and his mate.

  A crudely constructed well has been built here on the northern side of
the settlement, towards the north lies the last stretch of the road before
the chief's tent.  A side trail heads off to the west towards the barracks
where the majority of the gnoll warriors spend their time.  A few guards can
be seen patrolling the area.  The well is situated so that the chief has
the best access to it, while everyone else must take a walk to get to it.

&+yA Small Dirt Path&n~
  This small dirt path goes from the well in the center of town towards the
large barracks on the west side of the village.  This path is rather crude
and dirty, and there are usually several gnoll's sleeping outside on the
path, rather in the smelly conditions of the barracks tent.  The area smells
of the uncleaned bodies of the gnolls.  War cries can be heard from inside
the barracks as yet another raiding party gets ready for the hunt.

   The barracks of the gnoll encampent houses the majority of the warriors of
the entire tribe.  The only ones who don't live in the barracks are those
who have been highly decorated in battle and the chief has given a special
tent to.  The barracks are one of the worse places to live in all of Duris.
The smell of the gnoll barracks is one that only an ogre cave might compare
to.  There are no beds in the sense of civilized beds, rather piles of
furs and hides that the warriors sleep on. There are a few weapon racks,
crudely made at best.

   The chief gnoll leads the afairs of the tribe, directs their movements,
and thus has his own large tent.  The chief, possessing a few shaman powers,
is quite often a medecine man for the tribe.  Unlike the dirty tents of
some of the gnoll warriors, the chief's tent is filled with gnoll medical
herbs, and statues of various gnoll gods.  The best furs and best trophies
are also kept in the chief's tent, as well as the majority of any money
they might loot from their victims.

    The elves who have created this small inn for travellers have done
so in the side of a tree.  Probably created with magical means, this
extremely large tree houses a save haven inn for those elven and centaur
travellers who need rest here.  A pair of wooden doors, appearing as part
of the large tree, are barely visible.  A small sign reads "Welcome forest
kin."  This area seems quite peaceful and pleasant compared to the savage
beasts that wander the other areas of the forest.

the owners of the inn have a small room south of here.  The inside of
the inn is decorated immensly with elven carvings.  Though there are
few centaurs who choose to stay at the inn, there are rooms made especially
for them.  The exit to the inn lies to the east.

   This shop is run by an elderly elvish man, who is getting on in his
years.  He seems to have retired from the life of adventuring to help
build and provide a safe haven for elves and centaurs during their travels
through some of the more dangerous woods.  The shop itself contains a large
variety of items, ranging from armor to weapons to food and drink.  This
appears to be a general store, buying most items.  There are also a few
standard items that the shopkeeper has in abundance of, mainly elven made
armor and weapons, slightly better quality than standard issue.
