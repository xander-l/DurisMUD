A Rutted Road~
   The wars against the evil races have left their mark upon the
land as well as the people. Here at Fateful Falls one can see the
marks of this. Trees, those still standing, have arrows embedded
within their bark, spots of black where fire scored but did not kill.
The ground is littered with the odd broken buckle that once held
swords secure to a warriors belt or a shield that was shattered by
a massive blow. The rutted road leads eastward toward the village.

A Rutted Road~
   A dirt road lies east and west of here. Ruts made by wagon's wheels
gouge the road to either side. The fields that lie to the north are
ill tended. Grass has overtaken parts of the nearest field and the
corn that is planted there are leaning with wilted brown leaves. To
the south it looks even worse. What might have once been a field is
now a tangle of brush and briars.

field~
   The field may yield some corn and other vegetables, but it has been
neglected. Grass is abundant taking in the nutrients that otherwise
would be used by the crop.

A tag around the neck of the black cat says "Hello, talk to my master
Zornade. He can help me and you."
