Inside the Gates of Sarmiz'Duul~
   Here, a short entryway is flanked by tall stone walls.  Arrow slits,
covered palisades, and oil holes are visible far up the walls, offering
anyone to dare try to come through the gate in anger.  The noises of the
city are muffled here, sounding like a dull roar underlying the day.  The
road continues north and south.

Along the Outer Wall of Sarmiz'Duul~
   The road along the outer wall is sparsely traveled, as most of the city's
activites take place further inwards of town.  No refuse litters the streets,
implying that the roads are policed regularly.  Rather than amplify sound,
the stone in the walls muffles it, creating an almost still atmosphere for
those who walk along the road.

Along the Inner Wall of the Royal Docks of Sarmiz'Duul~
   This wall protecting the Royal Docks has the same kind of hardy
construction that is used to defend the city in the outer walls.  This wall
looks to be able to easily stave off intruders who might be interested in
assaulting an unprepared member of the royalty, however, the wall only
protects a small area adjacent to the bay, so it is completely ineffective
in repelling a true invasion from the sea.

   &+yThis wide wooden bridge spans the Mixag River, which splits the city into&N

&+yskiffs to pass underneath, but not enough to allow any real transport craft&N
&+yto navigate.  This prevents private merchants from using the river to bypass&N
&+yany taxation that the city commands from any merchant to transport goods&N
&+ythrough the city.  It is also effective for preventing a sea-based invasion&N
&+yto attack the city at its interior.&N

the biggest commodity seems to be meeting others.  Groups of commoners stand

fast copper, and guards try to keep what little peace there is to be had.
In the air can be heard a chorus of jumbled voices talking about anything

&+mAn Open Air Market&N~
   This is a large open air market.  Although merchants do sell wares here,
the biggest commodity seems to be meeting others.  Groups of commoners stand
around talking, children run underfoot playing games, thieves try to make a
fast copper, and guards try to keep what little peace there is to be had.
In the air can be heard a chorus of jumbled voices talking about anything
and everything.

&+GBank of Sarmiz'Duul&N~
   This small stone building houses the bank of the city.  Only one bank has
survived the rigors of this economy, and due mainly to the husky guards that
the banker employs to make sure that his books balance at the end of the
day.  Licensed and supported by the local government, this bank has very
few worries about turning a profit for its labors.

   The temple is a large building, with vaulted ceilings, rows of pews, and
both a large central altar, and several smaller altars for private worship.
Even though the room seems to have perfect acoustics, the sounds present are
muffled and unrecognizable.  A small door can be seen towards the north wall,
and a set of double doors can be see along the east wall.

&+gA Large Altar to &+RTavril&N~
   This part of the temple houses the main altar to Tavril.  The altar itself
is roped off, while several kneeling benches are resting outside the ropes,
allowing for worshippers to pray without breaching the border.  Several tall
candelabras softly illuminate a statue of Tavril standing behind the altar,
giving the illusion that the statue is watching over his worshippers.

&+LA Small Hallway in the Temple&N~
   This poorly lit hallway has a few doors along its length.  A harsh change

   This room is slightly more lavish than the acolyte's rooms.  This room
houses the decons of the temple; those who have passed the rigorous training,
and have themselves moved up to instructor status. Deacons handle most of the
administration and running of the temple.  The beds are cushioned, farther
apart, and a small fold up desk is near each bed.  Otherwise, the room looks

religious leader of the church.  Fine silks hang over a large bed, a large

Tavril's glory are hanging over every bare section of every wall.  The priest
must entertain some very important people here, as even his guest chairs are

&+LAn Underground Hideout&N~
   This smallish cave appears to have been constructed in haste.  Plank
supports dot the walls, but have obviously not been restructured since they

&+RTravol's Fine Stones&N~
   This compact building houses the only jeweler in town.  There doesn't
appear to be much traffic in this shop, due to a lack of precious stones
to be found in the nearby mining areas.  However, enough trade is generated
by travellers looking to trade that Travol can stay in business.

&+YTangwystl's Leather Goods&N~
   This stone building reeks of the chemicals used in tanning.  The walls are
coated with a thin layer of precipitate, slightly sticky to the touch.  The
proprietor must handle all aspects of leather, from tanning to forming to
selling.  Luckily, there are a few open windows, otherwise the smell would
be intolerable.

   This room looks to have suffered some explosion from within.  Shattered
glass, charred books, and melted puddles of wax give the impression of a
contained fireball had hit the room.  A summoning circle has been carved
into the stone floor here, the etchings filled with what look like dried
blood.

&+LThe Portcullis to Rodev Keep&N~
   This short stone walk ends sharply at an open portculis leading inside the
keep.  Twenty foot high &+Lobsidian&N walls surround the buildings within, offering
ample protection from invasion.  Slits pock the walls every 5 feet or so,
allowing archers to attack invaders without exposing themselves to attack.

&+yServant's Quarters&N~
   This small wooden building can house about 4 servants comfortably.  There
is precious little in the way of personal belongings, but then again, these
are servants after all.  Four narrow, yet comfortable beds rest along each
wall, and a small table dominates the middle of the room, where the occupants
can share a meal.

&+mThe Quarters of Aberla&N~
   These are the quarters af Aberla, the King's advisor.  They are spartan in
comparison with the rest of the building.  The walls have been covered with
slate rock, and marked over with coal in magical scribings or some unknown
nature, as if the mage were working on some sort of magical formula.  There
is little else of interest here.

   This short dock is used for ships entering and leaving the city.  Merchants
carrying good, private vessels looking for refitting, and ship of foriegn
officials all must use this dock to enter the city from the sea.  Although
the pier cannot dock more than two or three small ships, there is only a short
walk to the city.

&+cThe King's Residence&N~
   &+WThis elegant building is comprised of &+Lobsidian blocks&+L, with what appears&N
&+Wto be &Nmelted steel&+W as a mortar.  The floors are carpeted with a think &+ggreen&N
&+gvelvet&+W, while &+mrich silk tapestries&+W hang from the walls.  Spaced every ten&N
&+Wfeet and mounted in the walls, are softly &+Yglowing orbs&+W that shed a pleasant&N
&+Wlight that curiously throws no shadows.  The interior of the building is&N
&+Wquiet and peaceful, with only the occasional murmerings from servants and&N
&+Wofficials as they walk past.&N

&+CRodev's Bedroom&N~
   This lavishly outfitted room is truly fit for a king.  Highly polished
&+Lobsidian blocks&N, with perfectly cut &+Wstrips of steel&N for &+Wmortar&N make up the
walls and floor here.  The pelt of a large &+ycave bear&N covers the main area of
the floor, while &+rrich red a&+Ynd gold spun&N tapestries hang from the walls,
depicting battle scenes of Rodev's glory.  Several &+Yglowing orbs&N are suspended
from the ceiling, making this room well-lit without being irritating.

&+LA Darkened Alcove&N~
   &+yThis alcove is used by the king's guards to monitor traffic to and from&N
&+ythe king without interfering.  It can fit a few guards comfortably, with&N
&+ybishops benches to allow some relief to those guards who have been standing&N
&+yfor hours on end.  A &+Yglowing orb&+y lights the room, but the curved nature of&N
&+ythe alcove diffuses the light slightly, making this room slightly darker than&N
&+ythe rest of the building.&N

&+GGuest Bedroom&N~
   This is a room used for important dignitaries visiting the King.  It decor
is plain, being very consious of not creating a setting that would be found
disgusting by one race, yet being appreciated by another.  A small area has
been set aside for guests to use in any area they fashion, offering a little
consolation for indivudual races habits.  No orb lights this room, rather,
the visitors are expected to bring thier own.

&+rA Small Harbor&n~
&+b   This small harbor seems just large enough for a few ships, being
&+bnarrow and apparently fairly shallow.  To the north, the walls of a
&+bfairly large city can be seen, and to the south, the ocean awaits.  A
&+bdock can be seen just to the north.
