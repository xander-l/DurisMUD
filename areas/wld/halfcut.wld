Approaching the &+yHalfcut&n Hills~
   The countryside to your south is made up of a number of plateaus.
Large, small, some fat, some narrow, these hills appear to have been
decapitated, thus deriving their name Half-Cut.  The tops of every one
seems unnaturally flat.

   The rough countryside allows you to travel north out of the hills,
and south, further into the &+yHalfcut&N Hills from here.

A Trail Through the &+yHalfcut&n Hills~
   The rough trail through the &+yHalfcut&n Hills continues here.  The dingy
brown sandstone around you gives this place a dull, dusty appearance.  Two
larger peaks stand out to the south.  The western peak is seems smooth,
and fairly circular.  The eastern precipice hides most of the view of the
hills farther to the southeast.

   The trail to the south heads into the heart of the hills, while a
smaller trail winds its way around to the west.

A Split in the Trail~
   The trail splits here.  To the east you can make your way around the
northern edge of an oddly shaped hill.  Southward, the way continues
into the heart of the &+yHalfcut&N Hills.  Jagged rocks of sandstone jut
out into the path around you, slowing your travel through the hills.

the dull brown background of the &+yHalfcut&n.  Very little vegetation
grows here, and the rocky outcroppings provide the only unusual
features of the hills.

West of an Odd Hill~
   The trail continues here to the north and south.  Directly to your
east lies an oddly-shaped hill, larger than the average here in the
&+yHalfcut.&n  The stone of the hill has an odd-looking shadowy color,
and an protrusion on this side of the hill seems almost avian in shape.

while the center of this barren place lies to the south.

to be made up of three closely joined peaks, giving the impression of
some sort of humps of some enormously large creature.  The tops of the
hills have the characteristic flat appearance of the rest of the hills
here.  To the south, the hills give away to a wide, open area.

Approaching a Tall Hill~
   The trail here is approaching the mouth of a &+Ltunnel&N into this tall,
narrow hillside.  A rotten wooden &+yframework&n lies along the side of the
hill, and appears to also approach the &+Ltunnel&N entrance.

At the Mouth of the &+LTunnel&N~
   The trail here turns sharply, entering a dark tunnel ahead.  A
rotten wooden &+ytrack&N comes from the side of the hill to the mouth of the
tunnel, but has been so damaged only small bits of debris lie scattered
around the edge.  A small &+csign&n is mounted near the mouth of the tunnel.

&+LA Small Alcove&N~
   The tunnel here ends abruptly.  The walls have been smoothed much
more so than in the rest of these filthy warrens.  Some small arrow-
sized holes are set into the eastern wall at various levels.  The only
exit lies to the north.

&+LA Cramped Tunnel&N~
   The winding tunnel splits into three directions here.  Southward you
can see it goes for a small distance, then ends.  Directly north it
turns again, providing no clue to the horrible danger that lurks there.
Eastward it goes for a small distance before turning.

&+LA Cramped Tunnel&N~
   This tunnel winds its way through the hill.  The walls are rough-
hewn, and uneven.  The floor has been chiseled away, and provides very
uneven footing.  The ceiling is very low, and makes you feel very
boxed-in.

across the hills, you make out a huge ravine, and the south end of the
hill knows as the &+gSerpents&N back.

&+yA Rocky Ledge&N~
   This small ledge clings precariously to the cliff face just to the

&+yAt the Edge of the Wood&N~
   A thorny crown of barren trees dots the surface of this flat-topped
hill.  To the south, a trail winds its way between the ashen-grey
trunks.  To the north, a trail winds its way back down off of the hill.
A slight stench wafts its way through here, and some sort of high
pitched screeching can be made out in the distance.

Plateau on Top of the Spire Mountain~
    This plateau on the top of a tall slender mountain is a very inhospitable
place.  The wind would be strong enough to completely sweep away small children,
or halflings.  The dust, or gravel, the wind caries with it abrades away at
everything in sight, including your skin.  The &+Ysun&N creates a heat on the rocks
that can be felt right through your boots.  However, there is one positive
about this horrid place.  The view from hear is quite spectacular as it is the
highest of the &+yHalfcut&N Mountains.

&+btime.  The dust on the floor is at least an inch thick and everything looks
&+bto be crumbling to pieces.  With two exceptions.  There are two very &+Lblack

Inside the Mouth of a Large &+LTunnel&N~
   This &+Ltunnel&N looks as if it has been here for a long time.  Too long perhaps.
Much of the tunnel is falling in on itself.  Large cracks in the ceiling and
walls suggest that the rest might soon follow. The &+Ltunnel&N continues to the
north but as you look that way you hear another &+Lrock&N fall.  To the south you
see the entrance to this tunnel with the remains of the &+ywooden&N tracks.

   The &+Ltunnel&N looks like it once continued to the north, however it looks like
the years have been too much for this &+Ltunnel&N.  Nothing is left to the north
except a large pile of &+Lrocks&N.  A few old &+Ytorches&N and&+y picks&N also little the
rubble.

&+LInside a Partially Collapsed Mine~
   &+LThe tunnels of this mine are quite large but very dark.  There are &+Ytouc&+yhes&+L
&+Lattached to the walls every ten feet or so but they have long since burned
&+Lout.  The floor is littered with rubble that has fallen from the walls and
&+Lceiling.  Large cracks in the rock around you makes it look like more could
&+Lbe added at any minute.  There is the odd &+wgl&+Wi&+wnt&+L of minerals coming from the
&+Lrocks around.  Perhaps this mine could still be functioning if it were more
&+Lstable.  The dust on the floor is fairly thick, but there does seem to be
&+Ltracks of a very recent visitor.
