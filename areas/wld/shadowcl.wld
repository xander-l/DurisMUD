&+gA Rough Path in a Thick Forest~
   This path, which is not much of a path but just a few worn down
plants, runs through one of the thickest forsets in the world. Also,
storms seem to come to this part of the world very easily for some
reason, leaving the plant life to have a lot of water to grow on.
The plants themselves look to be very young, but have grown very
very quickly.

&+gA Rough Path in a Thick Forest~
   The forest here has a few stopped down plants from something big
moving through the area here, and that is just about all that can
be viewed as a path. The rest of the forest is so deep it is almost
impossible to move in, and there are a lot of animals about as well.
The surrounding area is quite beautiful though, it has many types of
colorful flowers which grow all over the place. The plants around
these parts seem to be very well treated.

&+gA Rough Path in a Thick Forest~
   Trampled down plants from something very large moving through here is
just about all that can be called a path. The plants are so large around
these parts that it gets very dark very quickly. There are also many
beautiful flowers along these parts which glow in the moonlight, or shine
in the daylight. The flowers come in all different colors and shapes and
make beautiful scenery for the people passing by these parts.

&+gBy A Huge Tree~
  The path comes to an abrupt halt here as a very large tree, at least
ten feet in diamater soars into the sky with a huge sea of branches and
leaves sprouting out of it. The base of the tree is lined with moss
and other types of fongus, while there are also different kinds of
small mushroom growing on the bark of the tree.

   This small dirt path through the woods has been carefully
concealed from the outside world by a huge shrubbery. There
are several foot prints on the path, which are very very light.
There are also animal tracks all around the path, as well as
some of the biggest most beautiful flowers anyone has ever

that the plants can get the most sunlight, and get
close to the water of the area. The path is very
rugged and not much has been put there to keep
it in place from washing away in a rainstorm.

   The path winds around a small pond here, however the
pond is not easily reached by people on the path, due to
the large amounts of vegetation between the small dirt path
and the medium sized pond. There are huge trees hanging over
head, making it seem like a tree tunnel through the forest,
as travelers journey deeper in.

have to crouch down here while looking out, due to the
plentiful amounts of vines and other plants.
