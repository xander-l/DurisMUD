Landing at the Beginning of a Precarious Path~
   To the north a hole in the wall leads into a city; it is impossible to
catch more than a glimpse of it from here, walled off as it is.  It is
possible, however, to see what lies to the south and east -- a vast wasteland
lies in the basin below, surrounded by cliffs and mountains and higher land.
The ground looks uniformly grey and dead, save a few patches that look even
more desolate than others.  There is a single sparkle, as of the sun shining
off water, far to the east.  From here it is possible to reenter the city
to the north, or head farther down the path along the cliff to the south.

Precarious Path Clinging to the Cliff Face~
   The path winds its way along the sheer cliffside, about two and a half
feet long at its widest point.  It is well nigh impossible to turn around on
this tightrope of a path.  It is possible, however, to see what lies to the
south and east -- a vast wasteland lies in the basin below, surrounded by
cliffs and mountains and higher land.  The ground looks uniformly grey and
dead, save a few patches that look even more desolate than others.  There is
a single sparkle, as of the sun shining off water, far to the east.  From
here the path leads further down farther south, and to the north there is
some sort of landing.

The Path Takes a Dive~
   The narrow pathway comes to an abrupt end here.  It is possible, however,
for the especially stupi -- er, strong and able to climb down to the next
level.  A vast wasteland lies in the basin below, surrounded by cliffs and
mountains and higher land.  The ground looks uniformly grey and dead, save
a few patches that look even more desolate than others.  There is a single
sparkle, as of the sun shining off water, far to the east.  The path leads

Threatening Turn in the Precarious Path~
   Here the pathway zigs back north, parallel to the paths above and, if one
strains, it is possible to see the path below without falling off.  Barely.
As before, the path clings closely to the sheer cliffside, about two and a
half feet long at its widest point.  It is well nigh impossible to turn

lies to the south and east -- a vast wasteland lies in the basin below,

path to the north.

   Further north the cliff face bulges suddenly, interrupting the way north.
It does looks possible to climb down to the next level, but it also looks
possible to jump the fifty feet remaining to the bottom of the basin.  Both
look like bad ideas.  It is well nigh impossible to turn around on this

eager enough to enter the basin may jump here, and break their legs.  It is
not recommended.  It looks as if farther south it is a jumpable distance.

   The path stops here.  Period.  Finis.  It isn't even possible to climb

the remaining four feet to the ground level of the basin.  From here it is
impossible to see any appreciable amount of the basin ... the horizon is

The Edge of the Basin Wastes~
   This place a simply marvelous study in total and complete uniformity.
Perhaps no other place in the world is as utterly and perfectly the same
in every single direction as this place is.  The ground is grey with patches
of darker grey, interspaced with dead organic matter.  The dry, dusty, dirt
is cracked in places, slightly moist in others, giving off the distinct
scent of things long dead.  The air is heavy and hot, causing objects in
your sight to ripple with the waving air.  Perhaps the area's most striking
feature is how incredibly easy it is to become lost (read : do you know
where you are?  Are you sure?).  It almost looks as if the northern end of
the basin is within reach here.  Nah.

The Edge of the Basin Wastes~
   The most notable thing at this point is the sheer vastness of the land
stretching out to the east; the feeling of standing here is probably what
a mouse sitting at one end of the Droijim Palace's Banquet Hall experiences.
The sheer cliff forms a wall to the west and north.  In every other direction
the wastes seems to stretch on to infinity.

The Edge of the Basin Wastes~
   This place a simply marvelous study in total and complete uniformity.
Perhaps no other place in the world is as utterly and perfectly the same
in every single direction as this place is.  The ground is grey with patches
of darker grey, interspaced with dead organic matter.  The dry, dusty, dirt
is cracked in places, slightly moist in others, giving off the distinct
scent of things long dead.  The air is heavy and hot, causing objects in
your sight to ripple with the waving air.  Perhaps the area's most striking
feature is how incredibly easy it is to become lost (read : do you know

The Inexplicable Edge of the Basin~
   For some strange reason, the northern wall of the basin is approachable
here, if nowhere else.  There appears to be a crevice in the north wall that
is just large enough to pass into.  What lies inside is impossible to tell
looking in from without.

&+BThe Oasis&n~
   The problem with this area is that it totally disrupts the trend of bland
lifelessness.  There is a sort of oasis here -- a large pool of water.  The
moisture in the air -- slight as it is -- is a definite relief to dry and
bleeding sinuses.  There are a few large boulders scattered here or there,
and even some traces of grasses.  No trees have managed to grow in the
dead soil.

   The rank smell of the wastes blows in with the wind.  Succinctly, the
place smells like a slaughterhouse.  The northern wall of the basin is a

Entrance to the Basin Wastes~
   The cliffs loom to a point high over head to the west, forming a veritable
solid wall of rock.  To the north, south and east, however, the basin wastes
stretch out an interminable distance; the horizon is obscured by random rises
in the ground.  The ground is grey and dusty, cracked and dry.  From here
it is impossible to see any appreciable distance.  The air is heavy, hot and
dry, parching the throat and burning the eyes.

&+LThe Uniformly Depressing &+yBasin Wastes&n~
   This place a simply marvelous study in total and complete uniformity.
Perhaps no other place in the world is as utterly and perfectly the same
in every single direction as this place is.  The ground is grey with patches
of darker grey, interspaced with dead organic matter.  The dry, dusty, dirt
is cracked in places, slightly moist in others, giving off the distinct
scent of things long dead.  The air is heavy and hot, causing objects in
your sight to ripple with the waving air.  Perhaps the area's most striking
feature is how incredibly easy it is to become lost (read : do you know
where you are?  Are you sure?).  To the south and southwest the ground is
marshy, expelling great amounts of sulfur gas into the air.

&+gSlightly Swampy Ground in the &+yBasin Wastes&n~
   The ground here seems to have been moistened in some unknown fashion.
There isn't enough water to be useful, but there is enough to evaporate and
carry the scent of rotten organic matter into the air.  The air, already
thick and heavy, gains a new texture with the smell of smut.  Truly
delightful, if one is into sewage.  The marshes extend to the east.
Everywhere else the insistently uniform basin extends.

There isn't enough water to be useful, but there is enough to evaporate and
carry the scent of rotten organic matter into the air.  The air, already
thick and heavy, gains a new texture with the smell of smut.  Truly
delightful, if one is into sewage.  The marsh extends in all directions
except the south; that way lies relief from the stench.

&+LThe Uniformly Depressing &+yBasin Wastes&n~
   This place a simply marvelous study in total and complete uniformity.
Perhaps no other place in the world is as utterly and perfectly the same
in every single direction as this place is.  The ground is grey with patches
of darker grey, interspaced with dead organic matter.  The dry, dusty, dirt
is cracked in places, slightly moist in others, giving off the distinct
scent of things long dead.  The air is heavy and hot, causing objects in
your sight to ripple with the waving air.  Perhaps the area's most striking
feature is how incredibly easy it is to become lost (read : do you know
where you are?  Are you sure?).  The ground is marshy to the north, east
and west.  The clear patch within the marshlands extends to the southwest,
south and southeast.

&+LThe Uniformly Depressing &+yBasin Wastes&n~
   This place a simply marvelous study in total and complete uniformity.
Perhaps no other place in the world is as utterly and perfectly the same
in every single direction as this place is.  The ground is grey with patches
of darker grey, interspaced with dead organic matter.  The dry, dusty, dirt
is cracked in places, slightly moist in others, giving off the distinct
scent of things long dead.  The air is heavy and hot, causing objects in
your sight to ripple with the waving air.  Perhaps the area's most striking
feature is how incredibly easy it is to become lost (read : do you know
where you are?  Are you sure?).  The ground to the north, northeast and east
grows progressively marshy.  In every other direction the basin wastes
stretch out of sight.

&+gSlightly Swampy Ground in the &+yBasin Wastes&n~
   The ground here seems to have been moistened in some unknown fashion.
There isn't enough water to be useful, but there is enough to evaporate and
carry the scent of rotten organic matter into the air.  The air, already
thick and heavy, gains a new texture with the smell of smut.  Truly
delightful, if one is into sewage.  The swamp extends to the north, east
and south; to the west the dead dust of the basin covers the earth like a
plague.

There isn't enough water to be useful, but there is enough to evaporate and

delightful, if one is into sewage.  The swamp extends north, east and south.
It's pretty obvious what lies to the west at this point, one should think.

&+LThe Uniformly Depressing &+yBasin Wastes&n~
   This place a simply marvelous study in total and complete uniformity.
Perhaps no other place in the world is as utterly and perfectly the same
in every single direction as this place is.  The ground is grey with patches
of darker grey, interspaced with dead organic matter.  The dry, dusty, dirt
is cracked in places, slightly moist in others, giving off the distinct
scent of things long dead.  The air is heavy and hot, causing objects in
your sight to ripple with the waving air.  Perhaps the area's most striking
feature is how incredibly easy it is to become lost (read : do you know
where you are?  Are you sure?).

&+gSlightly Swampy Ground in the &+yBasin Wastes&n~
   The ground here seems to have been moistened in some unknown fashion.
There isn't enough water to be useful, but there is enough to evaporate and
carry the scent of rotten organic matter into the air.  The air, already
thick and heavy, gains a new texture with the smell of smut.  Truly
delightful, if one is into sewage.

The way south disappears into the darkness -- there is no way to gauge how

There is no door, no magic portal, no way through.  No mystic runes, no
inlaid spells, no Crystal City.  It's enough to drive someone mad.  The only
thing that remains is to head back out the tunnel and search the basins
again.  The very prospect of having to wander about there for days on end
is enough to drive despair into the stoutest and most driven hearts.  The
poor fellow here seems to have snapped altogether.  He appears to have died
with his teeth locked around a rock protuberance off the wall.
