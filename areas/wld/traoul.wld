&+rEntrance to Traoul's Lair&n~
   &+LThe road becomes much finer in quality here, inlaid with perfect cubes
&+Lof black rock. A grey stone arch arcs over this entrance, enclosing the
&+Lwide avenue. This area looks much better than the main city portion of
&+LTruktakyagyo, all of the finer things reserved for the king. Huge gates
&+Llies to the south, blocking the avenue.&n

&+BIn a Large Courtyard&n~
   &+gA large statue in the likeness of the king of Truktakyagyo dominates
&+gthe center of this courtyard, glaring evilly, and most likely is an
&+gexaggerated version of his true self. In his left hand he holds the bloodied
&+ghead of an enemy, and in the right, is a wicked looking blade, probably
&+gthe culprit responsible for the decapitated foe. To the north is another set
&+gof gates, possibly leading to the king's inner lair, reserved for
&+gprivileged goblins only, while east and west is the outer lair, for most
&+gof the others allowed within the first set of gates.&n
