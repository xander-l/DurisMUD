A Foggy Branch~
   This area is covered with a thick, dense fog.  The chitter of
some sort of animal comes from nearby.  Stretching upward through
the fog is a towering tree, of which you seem to be standing on a
branch of.  The ground seems to be several hundred feet below,
but with all the fog it is hard to estimate.  The branch seems to
lead toward the east, to the trunk of this enormous tree.

     The fog isn't as prevalent here.  From this lofty perch is a
fantastic view of the land below.  It seems to be a valley,
bounded on the north and south by large mountain ranges.
Everything seems to be covered in snow, although a few sparse
patches of green peep through this vast white blanket.  Far to
the east a city dominates an immense plateau. A path leading up
and down has been hewn into the tree here. Another branch leads
north.

burned the path to prevent anyone from climbing any further.  The
only way to proceed is back down the trunk.

The tree does not seem to be rooted to the ground here, rather
it seems to go continue down through a foggy mist.  What seems to
be hundreds of branches extend from the trunk in every which way.
Two large branches extend to the north and south, and a few small
structures are visible to the south.  With a well timed a jump off
the tree a snow drift is reachable to the east.

bark of Yggdrasil is a light whitish-gray, and seems to be
exceptionally strong; however taking an axe to Yggdrasil would
not be a good idea as the tree is not without its protectors.

several of the leaves.  There do not seem to be many birds here;
perhaps because it is somewhat cold.  There seem to be nests of

squirrels that inhabit the nests outside.  A bed of leaves lies
in one corner.  Only two large squirrels inhabit this lair
although it is large enough for several dozen of them.  Looking
closely, they only superficially resemble squirrels.  This is a
lair of the Ratatosk, the self-styled guardians of Yggdrasil.

is quite soft, indicating a recent snowfall.  The hill rises to
the east.  The glare of the sun against the snow is nearly
blinding, but large mountain ranges are easily visible far to the
north and south.  The fringes of a large glacier are to the

slope of the hill is dotted with stunted, scraggly looking pine
trees.  The foothills of the Vinsaar mountains start to the
north.  A frozen river snakes around the hill to the south and
heads eastward.  The top of what appears to be a wooden sign is
barely visible next to one of the pine trees.

After brushing some snow of the sign, you notice that a plaque
has been fastened to it.  Examining the plaque, you read the
following message:

   "Hail travellers! Know that ye have entered the realm of
Jotunheim, home of the fearsome frost giants.  The giants do not
look kindy upon strangers, so ye should be wary at all times.
North of here, in the foothills of the Vinsaar mountains, there
be a ferry across the Iving river.  The ferry leads to Asgaard, a
much more hospitable place than this.  South lies the Gindra
mountains, although ye would be wise to avoid traveling in the
monster infested mountains of Jotunheim.  The Torvald river rises
in the in the east in the mountains behind the city of Utgard.
River travel is unlikely; the river is usually frozen over.  This
land is not known for its balmy weather, so I'd advise that ye
carry some form of protection against the cold, be it warm
clothing or some sort of magical protection."

&+gA Smooth Trail~
   The peak overlooks a range of foothills that breaks into a
vast snow-covered plain. Far to the north the monotony of the
plain is broken by a frozen river, and beyond the river rise the
great Vinsaar mountains.  A trail has been carved into the side
of the peak as if by magic; the trail winds around the side of
the peak.  Apart from the snow and occasional rocks the trail is
almost perfectly smooth. A large volcano overshadows its
neighbors east of here but a sheer dropoff  prevents any travel
in that direction.  The trail comes to a halt west of here at a
large circle of immense rocks.

&+Lrocks sit every few feet along the path making travel somewhat

&+Lglacier scrapes its way through the mountains. The cliff face
&+Lhere is marred by a large black hole, the entrance to a lair
&+Lof some sort.  The opening is pitch black and nothing is
&+Lvisible inside. Discarded bits of food and other trash litter
&+Lthe ground near the opening.  There doesn't seem to be any way
&+Lto continue up the mountain past the lair. The trail heads

&+YA Small Hut~
   This small hut is built against the wall of a large cavern.
The hut is made of dirt bricks and roofed with sod. There are no
windows in the building.  The icy cold hardens the dirt making
the walls quite sturdy.  The floor is lined with yeti's fur as
are the beds in the room.  A stone table occupies the center of
the room; a few herbs are scattered about the table.  A stone
shelf runs along the wall covered with vials and jars of herbs.
A large iron cauldron sits in the corner of the room.  From the
smell, something is cooking inside.  A door leads east back to
the central cavern.

   This small river is only about fifteen feet across.  The river
trickles down from its mountain source under the shadow of the
great volcano Mount Siva eventually joining up with the Torvald
river to the north.  The heat emanating from this immense furnace
has been enough to melt the ice of the river in the otherwise
frigid climate of Jotunheim.  It is possible to continue south
into the Gindra mountains alongside the shore of the river.  A
clear blue lake - the source of the river - is in a bowl-shaped
depression between several peaks south of here.

&+C   The Torvald river is covered with several feet of thick
&+Cbluish-white ice providing the only road of sorts through the
&+Crealm of Jotunheim.  The southern shore is occupied by an
&+Cimposing granite building; smoke snaking out of the buildings
&+Cchimney is the only sign of occupation.  A jagged rock face
&+Cpasses for the northern shore of the river.  There are
&+Cprobably enough footholds to make a climb up into the Vinsaar.&n

&+LA Narrow, Crumbling Ledge&n~
   A narrow ledge juts from the side of the cliff face several
hundred feet above the ice-covered Torvald river at the base of
the Vinsaar.  Cracks mar the surface of the rock and the ledge
looks about ready to crumble from the side of the cliff.  All the
ice and snow makes the footing quite treacherous; a single
misstep could jar the ledge enough to cause a fearsome avalanche
of ice and rock.  The ledge has crumbled away to the east,
preventing any travel in that direction.  It is possible to climb
down the rock face here, but the footing is too treacherous here
to ascend any higher.

   A narrow icy passageway bored into the cliff face leads into a
large cave in the side of the mountain.  Large pools of water
collect all over the ground, and glow as if with some inner
light.  An enormous block of ice stands to one side of the
shrine, with a vaguely human-like figure encased within.  Streaks
of light  flash through the walls and the air crackles and glows
with energy.  Huge frescoes adorn the cave: Paintings of Thrym
crushing dwarves with his mighty axe, depictions of Thrym slaying
Aesir and Vanir at Ragnarok, Thrym at the head of a horde of
frost giants sacking Asgaard. A large marble altar stands in the
center of the shrine.  The only exit is back through the passage

providing the only footholds for a descent into a rocky gorge.
Occasionally a few rocks slip loose and plummet into the depths.

&+Wblocks arranged in a circular pattern.  The water is a deep
&+Wblack, but strangely gives off a glowing light.  Images
&+Wflicker through the pool but  never staying long enough for
&+Wmore than a glance.  This must be the fabled Well of Mimir;

&+rA Lair High in the Vinsaar Mountains&n~
   Cracked bits of bone and torn armor lie strewn all about the
entrance to this dark lair.  Pools of frozen blood collect all
about the floor.  Most of the stalagmites here have been smashed
but a few tall ones line the edge of the cave.  A frost giant
lies impaled on one such stalagmite; the heat still radiating
from the body indicates a recent kill.  The cave extends
northward. The sounds of heavy breathing can be heard within.  A
narrow shelf of rock offers a perch outside to the south.

&+rA Dragon's Lair&n~
   The cave has been hollowed out and is quite large.  Gold and
gems sit in a careless pile at the back of the lair, the plunder
of eons by the enormous white dragon that marks this lair as his
home.  This refuge high up in the mountains has allowed the beast
to grow to awesome proportions;  ordinarily the dragons of
Jotunheim are subdued while young and serve as pets or guards to
the giants.  The bones of unrecognizable beasts litter the floor.
A dozen frost giants bleed from innumerable wounds, their blood
collecting in pools on the ground that quickly freeze in the
cold.  Any that aren't already dead will quickly be so.

   This huge shack, nearly twenty feet tall, is barely large
enough to accomodate the girth of a frost giant.  The walls are
made of wood lashed together with twine.  Animal skins are tacked
onto the wood to keep the wind out.  Farming implements clutter
the floor and a huge iron plow sits forlornly in one corner; none

&+GA Vast Plain of Farms at the Base of the Great Plateau&n~
   A vast plain dotted with many farmsteads runs up to the edge
of the Great Plateau.  Frost giants can be seen tilling the land
with their massive iron plows, although how they manage to grow
anything in the cold is a mystery.  The rocky wall of the plateau
towers over the plain; it rises several hundred feet almost
straight up into the air.  A few giants can be seen scaling the
side of the plateau but the footholds are too far apart for any
but the giants to travel in this manner.  The Torvald river
crashes over the side of the Great Plateau in a tumble of ice,
and neatly splits the valley in two.  The farming plains continue
to the west and south.  One of the farming shacks can be entered
through an open entrance to the north.

is too high to see what their target is from here.  A narrow
trail runs along the base of the rampart.  Frost giants
sporadically come in from a camp to the west to replace any of
the fallen.  A large cooking fire burns to the north, and a large
iron gate has been set into the rampart east of here.

buildings constructed of the same black stone.  The wall runs
right up to the edge of the Great Plateau.  Several frost giants
stand watch, making sure that none of the warriors of Thyrm scale
the plateau in an assault.  Thundering rumbles of boulders
striking the wall resound through the air, none of which have
managed to even dent it.  The wall is odd in that it is seamless;
the wall doesn't look like it was built, rather it seems to
almost be a part of the ground.  Frost giant mages line the wall
to the east tossing spells at the enemy camp across the river.

A scarred, grizzled looking giant spars with many of the other
giants, evidently his pupils.  He barks out gutteral commands at
the other giants and occasionally slaps them with the face of
his axe.  A stone fence marks the boundary of the sparring yard,

on either side of the gate frequently pick up a rock from a large
pile at the base of the rampart and heft it over the walls.  The
gate opens at infrequent intervals to let out fearsome frost
giant berserkers, who attempt to storm an enemy encampment across

battle is not tolerated.  The rampart to the east comes close to

mages.  The thundering rumble of boulders striking the wall is an
all too frequent sound.  A field of force seems to extend upward
from the wall, preventing any of the boulders from striking at
the camp.  A few frost mages stand at the wall casting spells at
their foe across the river; others rest at the base of the wall
intently studying their spellbooks.  Occasionally a frost mage
collapses from the strain of holding the wall's spell intact
under the intense pounding of rock.  The wall runs to the east

&+yAtop a Rocky Overhang&n~
   A narrow shelf of rock sits on the cliffside overlooking a
vast encampment.  Clusters of black stone huts are surrounded by
a black stone wall.  Boulders can be seen arcing through the air
to come crashing against the wall.  Frost giant mages run to and
fro, many tossing spells against an enemy across the Torvald
river.  The shelf runs to the east here; it comes close to the
back of a large elegant tent.  A large rock sits strangely on the
ground here.

&+mBehind an Elegant Tent&n~
   A narrow shelf of rock sits on the cliffside overlooking a
vast encampment.  Clusters of black stone huts are surrounded by
a black stone wall.  Frost mages can be seen occasionally
leaving the huts to join a battle near the walls.  A large
elegant tent occupies the back of the encampment.  The tent is
made of a coarse woven cloth embroidered with gold.  Gold thread
has been sewn into the outline of the sigil of Kostchtchie.
Guttural sounds in an unintelligable language echo from within.
There is a slight tear in the fabric of the tent here.  The
narrow shelf of rock ends to the west.

intense cold comes from a swirling portal resting near the
throne; pictures of an icy, dead world can be seen within.  The
curtain is separated in two by a thin partition to the west.

   Pillars of stone have been moved into place to form a large
circle.  A large pentagram has been drawn in blood on the ground;
the pillars of stone sit at the peaks.  A single frost mage
stands at each corner, intoning the words to a magic spell.
Vague amorphous images of some hideous horror writhe and twist in
the air above the circle, as if struggling with the frost mages.
A flap leads into a large elegant tent to the south.  A battle
rages at the wall to the north, and a large altar has been

&+LBehind a Black Stone Wall&n~
   A seamless black stone wall encircles a camp of frost giant
mages.  The thundering rumble of boulders striking the wall is an
all too frequent sound.  A field of force seems to extend upward
from the wall, preventing any of the boulders from striking at
the camp.  A few frost mages stand at the wall casting spells at
their foe across the river; others rest at the base of the wall
intently studying their spellbooks.  Occasionally a frost mage
collapses from the strain of holding the wall's spell intact
under the intense pounding of rock.  The wall runs to the east
and west here; a large fluting metal gate breaks the monotonous
stone to the east.  To the south a few frost giants can be seen
standing inside a circular arrangement of rock pillars.

&+BA Still River&n~
   The Torvald river has melted but the water is almost perfectly
still, hardly moving at all. Several large chunks of ice float
and bob in the river water.  The weather is bitterly cold so it's
probable the river has melted by some magical intervention.
Scores of dead frost giants can be seen peering up from a watery
grave, attesting to the suddeness of the thaw.  Two large
encampments dominate either side of the river here. Huge boulders
fly forth from the north, only to be met by the sharp intonation
of an equally deadly spell from the south.  The black stone wall
around the southern camp comes right up to the shore of the
river; a fluting metal gate to the east is the only entrance
inside.  The river passes between the two camps to the east and
west.  A rocky strip of land runs parallel to the rampart north
of here.

be seen behind the rampart, heaving large boulders at a black

bickering at each other and gesturing at a large map hanging on
one of the walls.  One giant, apparently the leader, seems to be
admonishing the jarls for their failure to defeat the frost mages
of Kostchtchie.  The northern part of the cavern is strangely
shrouded in fog.  To the east the cavern ceiling slopes

tall, has been carved out of solid rock.  Scenes of battle have
been intricately chiseled all over the surface of the throne.  An
immense commanding presence permeates the air.  A forty foot
giant broods on the throne; this must be none other than Thrym,
mighty god of the frost giants.  To the south the jarls of Thrym
argue strategy in a council meeting.

However it curves slightly and comes to an end here. Small
boulders and rocks lie in great piles at the base of the wall.  A
few giants lie dead or injured but are summarily ignored by their
comrades.  Several frost giants occasionally reach over, grab a
boulder, and heft it over the wall; however the wall is too high
to see what their target is from here.  A narrow trail runs along
the base of the rampart.  Frost giants sporadically come in from
a camp at the western end of the wall replace any of the fallen.
Several huge frost giants guard an imposing mithril gate to the

   A delicate looking metal gate provides the only exit from the
camp of the frost mages.  The fluting metal spires into the air.
The metal looks as if would crumple easily, yet it holds fast
under repeated boulder strikes.  The gate has a faint glow about
it and sparks can be seen flashing in the air all about the gate.
The sigil of Kostchtchie has been intricately worked into the
metal repeatedly.  A door leads into a thatched wooden hut
nestled in the corner of the wall.  A small tower adjoins the hut
on its southern side.  A black stone wall encircles the camp to

altar.

landscape rather than scrying spells; most likely an attempt to
conserve energy.  Several bored looking frost giants train their
eyes on the enemy camp across the river, looking for signs of an
enemy assault.  A large iron ladder leads down through a wooden

spell components for a wide variety of spells.  The room has a
dead feeling, as if all magic has been sucked out of the air.

contamination by the prevalent magic in the rest of the camp.  A

Slaves can be seen working the land surrounding the city; carts

   A vast stretch of farmland spreads out in front of the city of
Utgard.  Slaves, mostly dwarven and elven, work under the lash of
the frost giant overseers.  The farmlands are dotted by the
presence of many stone wells, driven far into the ground to get
liquid water.  The weather is still cold enough to freeze water
but the magic of Utgard-Loki helps transform the otherwise barren
plains into a massive granary.  Deep wheel ruts from the many
wagons and carts lead up to the grey granite wall of Utgard to
the east.  The land gently slopes up to a large hill to the
south, and to the north lie many grassy pastures.

to provide drinking water for the animals.  To the north the land

The rocky hills on the northern highlands of the Great Plateau
serve as mines to the frost giants.  Slaves toil endlessly with
small iron picks banging away at the rock, looking for precious
ores.  A huge frost giant marked with the badge of Utgard-Loki
barks out orders here, directing the slaves and other frost
giants.  A huge tunnel leads directly into the cliff side; it
leads into a salt mine.  The hills slope down to the east along

Strip Mines in the Highlands~
   Slaves work with picks here strip-mining the hilly highlands
for ore.  Numerous slaves fall over from exertion or lack of
food; most are summarily beheaded by their cruel overseers.
Carts filled with iron, coal,  and tin are taken by the frost
giants and transported down to the city of Utgard.  The land
slopes down here into the massive northern wall of the city.  A
broad metal portcullis occupies the center of the wall.

&+LThe Northern Wall of Utgard&n~
   The massive grey granite walls of Utgard dominate the Great
Plateau.  The wall is made of many close-fitting granite blocks
and rises nearly a hundred feet into the air; the wall runs right
into the mountain here.  The walls surround the city on three
sides, the east side of the city being built against the side of
a mountain.  Frost giant sentries can be seen walking back and
forth along the parapet atop the wall and towers full of guards
sit atop the wall at regular intervals.  The land slopes steeply
to the north to rocky highlands; slaves swarm over the hills
mining for ore.  To the west a large portcullis is the entrance
to Utgard.

   The massive grey granite walls of Utgard dominate the Great
Plateau.  The wall is made of many close-fitting granite blocks
and rises nearly a hundred feet into the air.  The walls surround
the city on three sides, the east side of the city being built
against the side of a mountain.  A huge iron portcullis marks the
entryway into Utgard. Guards can be seen behind the gate, as well
as many of the citizen of the city.  The entrance oddly does not
seem to be very busy.  The land slopes steeply to the north to
rocky highlands; slaves swarm over the hills mining for ore.  The
walls stretch to the east and west.
  &+WYou notice that the gates are locked with HUGE metal bolts
&+Wthat only a team of giants with machiens to help them could lift.
&+Wclearly, there is no way past this portcullis, another way in must
&+Wbe found!&n

slaves and frost giants come down from the hills and pastures,
and seem to melt right into the wall here.  All are marked with
the badge of Utgard-Loki.  Fragments of a wooden sign are half
buried under some snow and rock.  The western wall of the city
stretches far to the north and south.

   "Travellers! Great peril faces ye atop the plateau.  The
armies of Thrym and Kostchtchie have come to all out war.  Ware
their battlezone lest ye be crushed.  The plateau is dominated by
the massive frost giant city of Utgard, home to their king
Utgard-Loki.  He is said to be a master illusionist and
thoroughly evil.  The walls of Utgard are protected by his magic,
and none can pass without his badge.  I have managed to weaken
his spell somewhat to allow entry if you so wish.  To activate
my spell, ye have but to speak my na..

That is all of the sign you were able to piece together, the
other fragments are hopelessly smashed.

point offers a view of the entire plateau.  Two great war camps
can be seen fighting near the Torvald river at the western end of
the plateau.  The eastern end of the plateau is dominated by the
massive frost giant city of Utgard.  The din of the cities
inhabitants can be heard from even here.  Far far to the west the
vague shadowy outline of Yggdrasil, the World Ash can be made out
towering over the lower valley of Jotunheim.  The only exit is to
follow the trail back down.

   A stone barricade has been hastily erected across the street
preventing all access to the rest of the city.  The streets seem
strangely deserted.  A few frost giants hastily shop for goods
and then quickly depart.  Roving press gangs of guards can be
seen conscripting people for the armies of Utgard-Loki.  The only
exit is to follow the street west.

   A huge stone well lies in the middle of a cobblestone plaza.
The well is sunk deep into the earth, low enough to reach liquid
water.  Glowing magic runes along the side of the wall also
attest to some magical means of keeping the water unfrozen.
Frost giant matrons frequently come up to the well and fill a
bucket full of water for their use.  Frost giants pass through
the plaza on their way between a commercial district to the south
and a long row of statues is to the north.  An odd garden lies to
the east at the front of Utgard-Loki's citadel.  A heavily
guarded gatehouse is to the west.

the residential area of Utgard.  They appear to be statues of
past kings of Utgard.  Almost all of them have been defaced
beyond recognition.  Only one statue, larger than the rest, has
remained untouched.  The runes chiseled in the base read "Utgard-
Loki" in the rune script of the frost giants.  His visage is
fearsome; undoubtedly this depiction serves as a constant
reminder to the populace and cows them into submission.  The
central fountain of Utgard is to the south.  A narrow unpaved
road winds through the residential district to the north.

shrubs and trees manage to flourish in the garden under the
magical help of the king.  Set amidst the bushes are numerous
large blocks of ice.  Within the blocks are trapped figures
of a diverse assortment: frozen humans, drow, dwarfs, even a fire
giant.  They stand as a monument to Utgard-Loki's power, and a
warning to his enemies.  A large iron gate leads into the citadel
at the eastern end of the garden.  The central fountain of Utgard

cauldrons bubble with the smell of stew.  Stone tables are
covered with bread and meats.  Utgard-Loki doesn't trust the
slaves to prepare his meals, so his hand-selected frost giant
cook spends most of his time preparing the king's food.  A well-

of the table sits a large frost giant wearing a gaudy looking
crown who gorges himself on the food set before him.  Many slaves
tend to the whims of the frost giant who sits alone at the table.

other than Utgard-Loki himself.  A narrow arch leads west to a

and appear to be locked in place.  Huge iron plates have been
driven into the ground; frost mage prisoners rest in shackles
attached to the plates.  Many appear to be in awful condition.
The exit is to the east.

   This large room serves as a guest room for visiting diplomats.
It is well furnished with a large bed and desk for the visitors.

the portrait is oddly different than the paintings in the lower
citadel.  The walls are decorated with frescoes of burning
earthbergs and rivers of molten lead.  This must be the room of
the emissary from Surtr's realm of Muspelheim.  A wooden door
leads south.
