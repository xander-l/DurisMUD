Inside a &+LFissure&n in the Cavern Surface~
&+L   The fissure seems only wide enough to go single file.  Eerie sounds&n
&+Lseem to emminate from further inside the gaping fissure in the rock surface&n
&+Lbelow you.  Hot air rising from below carries the stench of burned flesh&n
&+Land unwashed bodies.  Claw marks along the cavern walls show that something&n
&+Lis still living here.&n

A Well Used &+bUn&+rholy&n Altar.~
&+L   A large slab of obsidian with glowing &+Rrunes&+L occupies most of the chamber.  &n
&+LFanatics worship their &+bun&+rholy&+L gods by sacrificing anything
&+Lunfortuanate enough to fall into their grasp.  Gibberlings chant and howl in an&n
&+Lobvious fervor and seem total oblivious to your presence.  The stench of dried&n
&+rblood&+L and bodily waste draw attention to the mangled corpses that have been&n
&+Lstaked to the cavern walls.  A large pool of &+rblood&+L forms at the base of the&n
&+bun&+rholy&+L altar to flow in a stream to the west.  Gibberlings can be seen&n
&+Ldragging victims in from the west to the sacrificial altar.&n

A Long &+rBlood &+RS&+Lp&+ra&+Rt&+Lt&+re&+Rr&+Le&+rd&n Hallway.~
&+L   A long&n &+rblood s&+Rp&+La&+rt&+Rt&+Le&+rr&+Re&+Ld hallway stretches from the eastern &+Ylarders&+L to the&n
&+bUn&+rholy&+L Temple to the west.  &+rBlood&+L trails criss-cross the tunnel, some fresh&n
&+Lsome many years old.  Moans of ecstasy float in from the south.  Considering&n
&+Lthe vast amount of refuse its almost amazing that the only scavengers around&n
&+Lare gibberlings, no rats in sight.  A roughly hung wooden door is south.&n

&+LG'graz Meditation Room&n~
&+L   A feeling of &+Gev&+gil&+L and &+wdeath&+L emanates from a vile looking &+raltar&+L in the&n
&+Lnorthwest corner of the chamber.  This room has less garbage than any room&n
&+Lup to this point.  Rather than garbage and refuse littering the room, carved&n
&+Lsymbols and sacred writings take their place.  A &+Wbookcase&+L seems to be out of&n
&+Lplace along the east wall.  A woven mat of &+yreeds&+L is set before the &+raltar&+L.&n
&+LA large vermin infested rug covers a large section of the floor in the center&n
&+Lof an otherwise almost clean room.  The only obvious exit from this room leads&n

&+gA Moss Covered Grotto.&n~
    &+LStalagtites&+g and &+Lstalagmites&+g make the grotto appear to be the&n
&+ggaping jaws of some voratious beast.  &+GLichen&+g and &+Gmoss&+g grow on every&n
&+gavailable surface.  A pale soft &+wglow&+g given off by the luminous&n
&+glichen fades to blackness mere inches from its source.  The lichen&n
&+gseems like a thing alive as the tiny insects that thrive upon its&n
&+gnourishment move along its surface in search of food.  Yet for all its&n
&+gbeauty something evil and malignant permeates the air.&n

&+L     A small trickle of &+Bwater&+L seeps in from the opening above.  Seen from&n
&+Lthis side it appears the &+yboulder&+L had been thrown in place&n
&+Lwith much haste, leaving blood and scraps of skin as testimony to someones&n
&+Lfear of what lay above.  The many corpses and broken weapons on the ground&n
&+Lshow that a great battle was fought here.  The trail of blood and the dead&n
&+Llead to the north where another large boulder rests.  A rumble that sounds&n
&+Llike the earth in torment emanates from ths south side of the chamber.&n
