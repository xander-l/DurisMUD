    &+gWalking into this room there is the first thing noticeable is the large
&+bwaterfall &+gthat flowes in from the northern point and lands here in a
&+gpool and sends waves of fog out into the surrounding area. The world around
&+gis covered with moss and water from the splash of water that falls down from
&+gon high, the water here is clear and very clean, though the fog is thick.
&+gMoving around the edge of the waters it's hard to find a good footing though
&+gon the west and east sides of the waters there appears to be a paths that
&+gstop at the edge of waters, the paths head off into the distance from here
&+gand seem to be in well order except where the waters from on high have
&+geroded the edges of the pool over the sands of time. A small &+yarrow &+grests
&+gnear the base of the waterfall and appears to glow with a magical light,
&+gsymbols of &+GSolonor &+gseem to be engraved into the stones that make up
&+gthe steps that lead from the waterfall.

    &+gWalking into this room the first thing notchable is the fact that the
&+gthe trees here appear to be alive and ancient, they appear to be guarding
&+gsomething in the room though who knows what it would be. There is sounds of
&+gmusic all around and seems to call deep within you soul and body, it makes
&+gone feel a sense of calm and passiveness around you. The world seems to not
&+gmean as much as it did before and the world could go on without you, the
&+gsounds of the other woodland creatures appear to be gone and only the song
&+ghere remains. Moving closer toward the center of the room the sounds grow
&+glouder and louder and the songs seem to come from every tree around you
&+gthough they aren't moving they must be alive for how else could they give
&+goff this eerie sound. A small circle of stones are formed here out of granite
&+gand seem to wiegh tons upon tons, one can only wonder how they could get
&+gthey could have been formed togther here.

     &+bAmist the ceiling there is a small oval opening that allows &+Wlight&+b to

    &+LThis hidden Alcove of the &+WPale &+yTree&+L is a small little almost
&+Lhouse sized room with many directions in which it heads off in, it appears
&+Lthat at one time this might have been inhabited by a smaller race such as
&+Lmaybe some elves or there art loving creatures for there are paintings that
&+Lline the walls, statues and objects of beauty everywhere. There are small
&+Lstairs that lead into different directions and they lead off into the tree
&+Lbefore you. There is still furniture here from when it was occupied though
&+La think coat of dust is layen upon it from the ages, though it still appears
&+Lto be still in good working order. Looking around it still appears that the

&+r&+YThunder &+rand &+WLightning,&+r and when storms roll across the planes, his

&+renemies of Asgard.

&+LRoom of The &+bWanderer~
    &+bAfter passing through the entry way into this abode, the first thing
&+bnoticeable is a large &+LAnvil &+band large &+LHammer resting upon it. The
&+brest of the room seems to be almost totally formed out of rock and not as
&+bmuch tree and bark as the rest of the rooms around, though it still appears
&+bto be almost naturally formed as if they rocks themselves were never cut or
&+bmined. In the middle of the room lies a small &+wstatue &+bin the image of
&+yMoradin, &+bThe All-Father, And &+WSoul Forger&+b, the most respected and
&+bworshiped dwarvish deity across the Prime and Outer Planes. &+yMoradin's known
&+bas a very physical and forceful power-strength incarnate, even- and chant is
&+bhe doesn't have much in his brain box. &+yMoradin &+bis supremely crafty, for he
&+bjust doesn't let that side be seen to often, for he often likes to fool others
&+binto thinking he's soft in the head, and then trip them up once they drop their
&+bguard.

    &+CThe small little shop here seems to be filled with many trinkets and
&+Cother small nick-nacks some appear &+mstrange&+Band glow with an &+Meerie

&+CLabalas is said to be the power who measure out the elvish life span and
&+Cdecrees when it should be cut. He doesn't worry about any particular
&+Cindividual, prefering to see the race as a whole, in fact, a story says
&+Cthe he traded an eye for the ability to peer through time. Labelas is who
&+Cmakes the elves nearly unblemished by the passing of the years, and he
&+Ceases each new generation into an understanding with the last, by confering
&+Cwisdon and teachings on young and old alike, though he is rarely invoked
&+Cbut is often praised.

&+LA Large &+bSoot&+L-&+BCovered &+LCavern within The Dismal Cave.~
    &+rThe duergar are the gloomiest of all dwarves, driven deep underground
&+rby the dictates of their power, &+bLaduguer&+r, for which this room seems
&+rto be deticated to. The room here is drap and emaciated, no joy seems to be
&+rbe taken in how the room is set up, and many trophies line the walls of
&+renemies that have been killed for just the grim pleasure and the others pain.
&+rDuergar's aren't trusted by other dwarves and for a good reason, for the
&+rpasty gray creatures are malevolent and evil, using poison and pain to work
&+rthier will, one would be luck if they could escape their clutches. Small
&+rsymbols of &+bLaduguer &+rline the room, a Shield with Broken Crossbow Bolt,
&+rthe symbols themselves seem to glow a bit and give off of light. &+bLaduguer
&+r claims that he left the dwarvish pantheon of his own will, taking a voluntary
&+rexile to put himself at a distance from his "LAzy" brethren. He hates other
&+rdwarves and thier deities with a passion, and drives the duergar into early
&+rgraves with them punishing demands of work. He claims that he is trying to
&+rtrain them to be tougher than the average dwarf, and it seems to be working.
&+rThough in return for his brutal lordship, the god extends some benefits to
&+rhis people, he shows them how to create magical weapons, even though dwarves
&+rusually don't use such items, and he protects them from others.

&+mthat covers most of the room and items within it, it gives off a dull light
&+mthat lights up the rest of the room. The area around is well kept and the
&+mitems that are stored in the jewel cases are in well order, nothing here
&+mhardly seems out of place and they appear to be in good working order. A
&+msmall statue to &+LKiaransalee&+m, the &+LDrow &+mGoddess named "The Lady
&+mof the Dead", she is the goddess of undead and vengeance, and has recently
&+msieze a new home in the Abyss, casting her predecessor into the Astral void.
&+mShe now sits and broods in her realm and plots ways to free herself of the
&+mdominance of Lloth, she's what most mortals would call crazy, but there's

&+byou notice a pile of dead bodies in the corner that have rotted and decayed
&+bover time since they were killed. In the middle of the room is a Large
&+bpedestal with a statue of a Single Unwinking Eye, the symbol of &+gGruumsh
&+bthe orcish leader of the pantheon, and the god of war and who loves to fight
&+bfor its own sake. He revels in strife and pain, pushing his people to expand
&+btheir territories by driving other races from there lands. Glancing back around

&+bthough one might wonder how good of condition might be.

&+glouder and louder and the songs seem to come from every tree around you
&+gthough they aren't moving they must be alive for how else could they give
&+goff this eerie sound. A small circle of stones are formed here out of granite
&+gand seem to wiegh tons upon tons, one can only wonder how they could get
&+gthey could have been formed togther here. Amist the ceiling there is a small
&+goval opening that allows &+Wlight&+b to travel within the small circle of

&+gthese ancient trees are none other then Ancient &+GTreants &+gprotectors of
&+gthe forest and woodland creature within. They have probably grown here over
&+gcountless centuries and form an almost impentrible wall around, their limbs
