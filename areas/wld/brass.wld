do not claim to be of royal blood, or former nobles who have fallen on
hard times, politically or financially.  This is indeed the slum area of the
city of brass, which would still make any prime plane city look like a
dump in comparison.  This area also houses those non-efreeti who call
the city of brass home.

By far the busiest section of the Street of Steale as it intersects

the docks and moved to the nearby markets. The city wall is to the
north and to the south the street narrows just a little as forms
the Brass Harbor way. The street of Steale continues out of sight to
both the east and west of here.

reknown for the high quality goods that move through.

&+yThe Pyraculum Marketplace~
You can hear musicial sounds throughout the marketplace but this area
is definitely where the music was coming from. There is a Satyr who is
skipping around in an undefined pattern playing various instruments
keeping those who are interested entertained. He has a small circular
tent set up in what would be considered the center of the bazaar with
many instruments that are made of mostly medals or of some speciality
woods.

&+yThe Pyraculum Marketplace~
This is a massive bazaar with large copper paved roads in a circle
pattern in two layers, inner and outer, as it directs its passengers
around to its shops. The businesses line both sides of the road and
each business has a booth that has its own canopy covering with a small
tabletop counter. The larger shops are much more elaborant and some
have made themselves a more permenant building. The Pyraculum market is

In these rows of the marketplace visitors or residents can rent a tent
for the day or longer and sell their goods. The tents are not as private
as the others you see here in the bazaar but are more elongated to pro-
vide a greater amount of vendors to fit under one roof. They are well
maintained and are currently all in use for the day.

A single desk stands in the corner about five feet from each wall.
Behind is a single chair which Shanaanaa sits. The wall to the north
is a bit marred from the constant contact with the ball that is bounced
against it. On the opposing wall is a sign that reads,
                       "Information for Sale"

Just inside the door to this room are two pillars made solely of fire.
The fire seems to be moving downwards into to bronze shafts running
along the base of the walls that are filled with some flaming liquid that
continues to the next room. There is a well marked path in the middle of
the room leading from one to the next made of redish orange cobblestone.

This odd round tent seems most odd, the walls part as people get close
to it to allow access to the inside.  This tends to be un-nerving to the
faint of heart.  All sorts off magic devices and items are to be found
within.

A very dusty and not well travelled corner of the bazaar is tucked away
in the corner here. Just a single being resides here, the construct
called "the repair man". Flakes of its flesh forms layers upon layers of
dust as it stands motionless until needed. Several vacant shops are
adjacent nearby as their inhabitents probably found it a bit creepy as
did the bazaar traffic since not many visit here.

the accepted tradable races within the market and is defined on
the signs posted in front of the receptionist desk. North leads

engraved into them. To the north is the entrance of the slave market
and the Street of Steale. To the south is the slave market proper and

but is stale in such a hot place. The slave market continues on
in all directions save to the north that leads back towards the

located in the center of the room, a flame. The flame comes right out
of the floor by some magical means. It is not consuming any sort of

heat or smoke. The wall and floors are made of a mirror like surface
reflecting the light from the flame casting shadows of anyone who enters

&+yA Great Arch~
This room is a huge flaming arch that separates the palace from the
entryway. There is some mystical force which holds the flames of
this arch in place and is radiating with intense heat.

&+ySouthern Entrance to the Palace Courtyard~
This is a vast courtyard running for hundreds of feet in all
directions. A huge flaming fountain of fire can be seen to
the north, and strange trees of solid flame are growing here
in neat little rows along the edge of the yard. The main
building of the palace can be seen far to the north but an
imposing wall seperates you from it. Above, the flaming sky
can be seen with ease in this open space.

&+yThe Center of the Palace Courtyard~
The courtyard spans out here for hundreds of feet in all
directions. A large fountain of shooting flames rest here.
Different colors of flame shoot forth from its fiery base.
Large trees of fire and smaller bushes line the huge wall
of brass writhed in flames to the north and form a semi-
circle near the fountain. Extremely large benches litter
this area all facing the fountain.

The huge courtyard continues here covering almost an acre.
Flaming bushes and trees parkway to provide neat access to
the landing east of here. To the north the courtyard
continues toward the main structure and to the south a large
wall of some one hundred feet high rises upward into the sky.
The courtyard goes west of here leading to the great arch.

forty feet high and has intricate carvings set into the glowing
brass walls. The heat is still amazing in this place, far hotter
still then the city was and much hotter the Plane itself.

The ceiling is some fifty feet or more overhead with a curved shape to

too high for a human to see out of is cut in the wall with two braziers,
one on each side of the window, glow bright orange to light the hall.

&+yArtoon's Room~
This immense room obviously belongs to a god, at least that is the
impression anyone would get from walking into here. Huge flaming
columns of purple and blue flames run well over one hundred feet
from floor to ceiling and an air of energy can be felt everywhere
in here. The floor is of polished brass and there is a huge rounded
window overlooking the courtyard and fountains. The ceiling has
various paintings on it, depicting all sorts of efreeti activities.
These seem far less warlike than those enchanted elsewhere in the
palace. A bejeweled throne is in the far eastern part of the room.

the Padashaw to gaze upon himself at will. There is a huge glowing
brass chest in the corner and a dresser in another.
Several paintings hang on the walls...obviously not your normal
sort of paintings. The depict the Padashaw in various acts of battle,
love making and pageantry.

&+yThe Harem~
Several pillows of flame are all about the floor, in fact on closer
inspection the floor intself is made up of several pillow-like mats
or other similar material. There are small rooms inside this one,
where the ladies must live when they are not attending to the needs
of the royal family. All sorts of love-making paraphernalia lies
around in here, none of which looks usable by humans. A small
fountain is in the center of this two hundred plus foot room.

looking at the pool.

the east.

A huge pile of pillows is in the center of this massive room. Glowing
orbs are suspended in mid-air and braziers of incense are smoking here.

&+yA Grand Archway to the Palace's Throne Room~
This room is emaculate and brillant in design. There are vases, paintings,
tapestries, and other pieces of decore organized throughout the room that
move your eyes from one to then next in an appealing fashion. The columns
are hundreds of feet high and each are carved and look to be made of solid
brass forming an enormous archway. The floor has some sort of rug that goes
from door to door and you are sure it is made of magma as it is moving with
an uneasy motion. North is a double door leading into the main throne room
and to the south leads into a great hallway.
