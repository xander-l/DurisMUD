&+cBend Within a &+CPhan&+ctas&+Cmago&+cric Cavern&N~
&+c   This mystical cavern of mystery seems to glow with a faint light that does&N
&+cnot quite create twilight.  Images of thoughts that were long since past start&N
&+cto fade into the mind.  Dreams that are now only a flicker of a long since past&N
&+cmemory now invade reality.  Flashes of youth that once was wasted, for a moment&N
&+cis tasted.  Regret sets in, yet gives way to feelings of peace that soon this&N
&+clife shall gain release.  Oblivion fills the air, but does not cause anyone any&N
&+cdespair.  Doom falls from the gloomy darkness that looms above, forming in tiny&N

&+Linto the infinity of thoughts&N
&+wAs the Darkness creeps over the Northern mountains of Norway and the silence&N
&+wreach the woods, I awake and rise...  Into the night I wander, like many nights&N
&+wbefore, and like in my dreams, but centuries ago.  Under the moon, under the&N
&+wtrees.  Into the Infinity of Darkness, beyond the light of a new day, into the&N
&+wfrozen nature chilly, beyond the warmth of the dying sun.  Hear the whispering&N
&+wof the wind, the Shadows calling...I gaze into the moon which grants me visions&N
&+wthese twelve full moon nights of the year, and for each night the light of the&N
&+wholy disciples fade away.  Weaker and weaker, one by one.  I gaze into the moon&N
&+wwhich makes my mind pure as crystal lakes, my eyes cold as the darkest winter&N
&+wnights, by yet there is a flame inside.  It guides me into the dark shadows&N
&+wbeyond this world, into the infinity of thoughts..thoughts of upcoming reality.&N
&+wIn the name of the almighty Emperor I will ride the Lands in pride, carrying&N
&+wthe Blacksword at hand, in warfare. I will grind my hatred upon the loved ones.&N
&+wDespair will be brought upon the hoping childs of happiness.  Wherever there is&N
&+wjoy the hordes of the eclipse will pollute sadness and hate under the reign of&N
&+wfear.  The lands will grow black.  There is no sunrise yet to come into the&N
&+wwastelands of phantoms lost.  May these moments under the moon be eternal.  May&N
&+wthe infinity haunt me...  In Darkness.&N
