&+CA Pathway of Broken Marble~
&+W   Leading towards what seems to be a dense foliage on the eastern horizon,&N
&+Wthis path, most likely a once grand highway has eroded with the years passed.&N
&+WStrewn about the ground surrounding this walkway are marble pillars, too&N
&+Wheavy to lift, and too old to recognize. The air here is relatively foggy and&N
&+Whumid, yet the mists remain at floor level not rising above a foot or two&N
&+Wfrom the ground.&N

either side of the path however, are now the remnants of stone walls which
apparently served no other purpose than decorations to this evidently
once revered path. A small dirt trail branches off from the path and heads

what ruins remain of it, the people of this land must have been both great
artisans and proud warriors. To the west, a wooden shack is placed, and to the

   The grass and mud give way to interlocked stones at first and to a stone
bridge a few feet eastwards.  The bridge leads towards a huge arched entryway.
The doors to the latter are easily measured at a good fifteen or twenty feet
in height and are made of some sort of wood that is undistinguishable from
here.  Gigantic statues of what must have been former knights of this keep are
cemented to both sides of the bridge.  Their weapons and glares pointed to the
sky, these might be a tad more symbolic than they seem.

a wonful chandelier, its rope still tied to the wall to the far left.  A few
words undoubtedly in a foreign language are incribed on the wall to the left
here over a small basin affixed to the center of it.

&+CThe Temple's Main Entrance~
   The entrance widens here, fashioned into the shape of a small square, the
entryway elevates elegantly into the shape of an parabolic dome.  At the
dome's foyer hangs a golden reproduction of the temple insignia.  It is
solidly affixed to the ceiling with a thick steel chain.  On the floor, the
wonderfully done mosaic continues its way along the temple entrance.  It
apparently depicts a knight holding a flaming sword high above himself.

&+CThe Temple's Main Entrance~
   Along the entrance walls are positioned numerous wonderful works of art.
This one here is an oil painting of a beautiful sunset over a green valley
with people standing about a temple in the center of it.  Most likely being a
representation of this temple quite a while ago considering the state of things
outside, it reminds that this place has a deep history and confirms some kind
of tragedy; else a people this prosperous wouldn't have fallen to such ruin.

   On this wall, the stone figurine of a man holding a sceptre is cemented to
a stone mantle.  Dressed in long robes, this man must have held a high
hierarchical position in the temple's elite.  No name is inscribed below or
on the statuette, probably because he was a well known figure.  The beatiful
mosaic is present on the floor here as well.

   On this side of the room is a hole in the ceiling from which a thick hemp
rope descends and falls to the ground.  Staring upwards and onto the floor
below, it is possible to notice that rust has developed and fallen to the
floor, most likely meaning that the bell is stuck in place up there.  The
wall corners here, and on the west facing side of it is affixed a full-sized
mirror.

   Directly below the parabolic dome, this part of the entrance would
correspond to its center.  The tiles are relatively worn here, most likely
because of repeated genuflexions.  The entrance dome falls to a second arch
here to the east which opens out onto the primary mass hall.

   Hung on this wall is a charcoal on paper rendering of a baptism, the picture
depicts a musular man, standing in a pool with a gathering of white robed
men around him.  One of the men is holding a vase, from which he is pouring
water on the unrobed man.  The temple's symbol is sketched high in the sky
above this scene. The floor here is covered with the lovely patchwork of
a gem mosaic.

deep into a demon's cranium.  The demon is leaning backwards, in fear it seems
of this man that is destroying him.  The warrior is wearing a beautifully
carved suit of armor upon which the symbol of a flame is printed.  A mosaic
work covers the floor here, it was done with gems rather than ceramic.

   This wall is bare, with nothing displayed or affixed at all.  Perhaps it was
intended that it would be the next display area for whichever next deed was
immortalized into art.  Nonetheless, though the patchwork of mosaic tiles
adorns the floor, no decorations are here.  The walls are of stone as the
others, and the dome round over one of this square room's corners.

   Standing directly in front of the temple's prayer hall entrance, through
which a series of pews are distinguishable, one can't help but notice the
terribly frightening silence.  The hall is huge, and from this relatively
small entrance, it seems even larger.

&+B   The doors give onto the central aisle, whose wide blue carpet leads eastward
&+Bto an altar between a pair of rows of pews.  The pews are all the same, made
&+Bof some black material, and all still standing.  The ceiling must be a good
&+Bhundred feet high and about nine feet away from the latter is a balcony that
&+Bgives way onto the mass hall.  It seems that the balcony runs all along the
&+Bsides of the central dome's glass periphery, and serves as a second tier from
&+Bwhich onlookers stationed on that second floor could watch mass.  A wondrous
&+Blight filters through in here.  Its origin is unkown.

&+gnorthern row of pews.  The carpet lines a huge wall which climbs extremely&n
&+ghigh to reach a balcony like viewpoint along this northern wall.&n  The path&n
&+gleads westwards to the back and eastwards to the front and to a candlelit&n
&+gprayer chamber.&n

&+WA Path Before the Altar~
&+W   Where the green carpet ends, a small recessed alcove begins.  A faint light&n
&+Wis coming from within the dimly lit cubicle, and shadows dance within it. The&n
&+Wgreat wall that encloses the mass hall on its northern side meets with
&+Wanother here, and in that corner is hung a huge sconce with a very big torch
&+Win it.

&+WA Path Before the Altar~
&+W   In front of the first row of pews, this was the ideal place to be when&n
&+Wlooking for a prime seat.  About two or three feet away from the pew&n
&+Witself, the altar mound's elevation begins.  The floor is of stone here,&n
&+Wwithout any fancy carpets to dress it.  To the north is the northeastern&n
&+Wof the mass hall, and to the south lies a great white altar.&n

&+WA Path Before the Altar~
&+W   The light here, filtered through the glass dome high above, shines a&N
&+Wmyriad of colors about the ground and pews.  The unexplained lights dance&N
&+Wmagically about the hall, and the foyer of all those lights seems to be&n
&+Where, where all colors meld into one beautiful light.  The altar is close&n
&+Wto the south, and there are two huge statues on the east side of the path.&n

&+WA Path Before the Altar~
&+W   So close up front, the altar is quite an impressive sight.  Directly in&N
&+Wfront of the pews is a pair of immense statues.  These two are balanced by&n
&+Wa pair on the other side of the altar.  It seems that the people who lived&n
&+Where before were quite artistically conscious.

&+Wof a winged angel holding a book.  The rows of pews extend to the west, and&n
&+Wa big wall towers over the chamber immeditately to the east.&n

&+WAt the Humming Altar~
&+W   The altar floor is perhaps three or four feet higher than the ground floor.&n
&+WThere are decorations all about the altar itself, the wooden ones rotting,&n
&+Wand the stone ones intact.  The carpet here, as opposed to the blue carpet&n
&+Wbefore the altar, is ruined with caked blood - covering it almost entirely.&n
&+WHigh above the altar, and above the whole mass hall for that matter is an&n
&+Wimmense elliptical dome that arches high and was most likely the mass hall's&n
&+Wsource of light.  It is crafted wonderfully with stained glass which shows&n
&+Wmany scenes of combat.  The view of the hall from this point is breathtaking,&n
&+Wand was probably the pride and joy of whichever priests served at it during&n
&+Wservice.

&+bThe High Priest's Passageway~
&+L   Sloping downwards slightly, this passage is becoming quite cramped.  These&n
&+Lpriests musn't have been very big at all considering the width and height&n
&+Lof these, that is understating that they were human at all.  The passage&n
&+Lleads south to a bend, and eastwards towards what seems to be a wall.&n

&+Lany case.  Small insects crawl on the floor here, and the walls are covered&n
&+Lwith dust.  It could be sworn that dried blood covers the floors here, as&n
&+Lthe dust seems to have collected unevenly upon some dark brown patches set&n

&+Lsolid with what seems to be packed meat.&n

   The walls, ceiling, and floor bear terrible scars of a battle that must have
taken action in these close quarters.  There are sets of claw marks it seems
in the walls as well,  decorating the walls in a scratched mosaic of war and
conflict.  The sconces have been torn from the walls and lay on the floor,
bits of strewn metal, most likely the remnants of blades smashed against the
stone decorate the floor here as well.  The hall extends westwards to an
intersection, and eastwards towards another.

&+WIn a Hallway of White Marble~
   In this hallway, the floors are lined with majestic marble tiles, and the
ceiling and walls the same.  There are carvings in the marble along where the
doors are, long desecrated by time and different damages, as there are sword
marks strewn about the doors and walls themselves.  The battle must have been
fierce, yet quick and effective, as the marks on the walls do in fact seem
to come from the same blade.

   To the north, this hallway ends abruptly, most likely prey to the elements.
What impedes passage northwards is the wall itself, fallen to the
floor, laying debris thickly strewn about.  The walls and floor are bare
here, most likely because it was only used by temple guards and personnel.

   The walls and floor are bare here, without decoration or artistry.  They are
still constructed of the same cemented stones however, and though not as
pretty as the other hallways nearby, they must have served the temple
personnel just as well.  The hall extends northwards and southwards towards an
intersection of some sort.

&+bA Secret Chamber in the Cold Room~
&+L   Someone has ravaged through this place with his fists!  The walls and&n
&+Lfloor have all been punched to shreds, and bricks and debris are packed&n
&+Leverywhere.  It seems someone has tried to clean up and re-patch the walls&n

&+L   This seems to be a huge grotto that was carved from this central point.  The&n

&+Lintertwined with the hot sulphuric air, this place makes for a terrible&n
&+Lplace to stay, and every urge is to leave as well.&n
