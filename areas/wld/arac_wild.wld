&+LA Sharp, Blood Covered Spire Deep in the Heart of the Crescent Chasm&N~
   &+LThis massive spire made of black marble has an unusual pattern of&N
&+Lconcentric circles fashioned by some softly glowing red veins. This&N
&+Lmost unusual pattern of rock coloration is almost masked by a thin&N
&+Llayer of dry blood that seems to be drawn down from the tip of the&N
&+Lspire. To the mature eye, it looks as though many creatures have&N
&+Lfallen upon this spire from great heights, possibly resulting in a&N
&+Lmost unhealthy outcome for the creature. A fine keening sound is &N
&+Lcaused by the voracious wind as is rips through this portion of the&N
&+Lchasm.&N

&+LHole in the Floor of the Crescent Chasm&N~
   &+LMassive spikes tower high overhead, some seem to be hundreds of&N
&+Lfeet high, others barely thrice the height of the average ogre. The&N
&+Lonly common characteristic of all these spikes is the pattern of&N
&+Lconcentric circles of softly glowing red veins through their black&N
&+Lmarble surface. The floor of the cavern is littered with bones that&N
&+Lhave shattered as if dropped from a great height. The floor of this&N
&+Lcavern is also marred by a massive hole that extends down into&N
&+Ldarkness.&N

&+LHole Beneath the Crescent Chasm&N~
   &+LA jagged vertical tunnel has opened in the marble here, leaving&N
&+Lragged red-veined black marble walls, allowing for an easy climb&N
&+Leither up or down. The middle of the shaft is occupied by a very&N
&+Lstrong breeze, blowing upwards from whatever lies below. The&N
&+Lveins in the rock here throb lightly, almost invisibly. Strange&N
&+Lnoises, that almost sound civilized, echo up from below.&N

&+rDurithalite Shaft&N~
   &+rThe red veins here have overwhelmed the black marble base that&N
&+ris very common throughout the rest of these caves. The saturation&N
&+rof the red material, Durithalite, causes the entire shaft to be&N
&+raglow in a sickly blood red light. To make the effect even more&N
&+rnauseating, the Durithalite pulsates, causing the ambient light&N
&+rlevels to rise and fall in a most disconcerting fashion.&N

&+LCavern of Black Crystal&N~
   &+LThe black marble suddenly gives way to some strange crystalline&N
&+Lsubstance. Quartz-like glassy walls of translucent black mineral climb&N
&+Lhigh overhead. These walls are veined like the marble above and below&N
&+Lthis room, and the glowing radiates gently through the crystal. Small&N
&+Lholes have been carved in the floor and ceiling of this very large&N
&+Lspherical room. Occasional large crystals protrude from the walls,&N
&+Lmaking large hexagonal shafts of mineral. A hole has been blasted in
&+Lthe east wall.&N

&+rCavern of Durithalite&N~
   &+rThe walls of this cavern are made entirely of a strange glowing&N
&+rred stone. The stone seems to pulsate uniformly, causing constant&N
&+rchanges in the low light levels of the room. The radiance from the&N
&+rwalls blurs any distinction between the floor, roof, and walls of the&N
&+rcavern. The whole experience is rather nauseating. The cavern continues&N
&+ron to the south.
