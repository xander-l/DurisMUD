&+BOn a Strange Moat&N~
   The water is clear and cold, and has an bizarre current to it.  This
oddly shaped pond is more of a moat that surrounds a strange square
field to the east.  When one stares at the field long enough it
shimmers a bit and one can see the vague outlines of a tower.  It is
utterly impossible to exit the pond to the east, some sort of invisible
wall blocks any passage.  Water continues to the north and south, and
an eerily quiet forest is to the west.

&+BOn a Strange Moat&N~
   A light current here bounces from north to east as the moat makes a
sharp turn here.  The field to the northeast is completely surrounded
by this odd moat.  In fact the moat appears to be more of an oddly
shaped pond than anything else.  Grass growing in the field that it
surrounds is unapproachable however, there is some sort of invisible
wall that protects it, if it is real that is.  When one stares at the
field long enough it shimmers and the vague outlines of a magificent
tower can be seen, but the vision quickly fades, leaving one to
question their sanity.  The forest is to the south and west and the
moat continues to the north and east.

&+BOn a Strange Moat&N~
   There is definitely something very odd about the field to the north.
The strange shape of this pond can only lead one to think of it as a
moat that surrounds a barren field to the north.  But is the field
real?  There is an invisible wall of some sort that prevents any sort
of travel to the field, the current is slow enough that it should be
easy to exit here, some invisible force simple prevents one from doing
so.  The moat continues to the east and west and there is an eerily
quiet forest to the south.

&+BOn a Strange Moat&N~
   There is an almost stifling silence here.  The forest to the south
is almost ominous in its silence and the field to the north emits no
sound whatsoever.  Whatever invisible wall prevents exiting the moat
onto the field also prevents the sound of the grass blowing in the wind
to come through.  In fact, it is so quiet that one has to question
whether the field to the north is actually real.  If one stares at the
field long enough it shimmers a bit and the vague image of a tower can
be seen.  Though the image swiftly dissipates, there is something
substantial and mysterious to it.  The moat continues to the east and
west and a forest is to the south.

&+BOn a Strange Moat&N~
   The light current bounces off the steep mountain face to the east to
head north around the odd grass field to the northwest.  Though the
moat is peaceful and quiet, more of a pond then anything else, there is
something about it that is disconcerting.  Swift dark shapes can be
seen shooting through the crystal clear water.  Despite the clear
water, the shapes are somewhat amorphous and don't look anything like
normal fish.  Sometimes they look more like twisted reflections of
light and shadow than of anything else.  The moat continues to the
north and west and there is an eerily quiet forest to the south.

&+BOn a Strange Moat&N~
   A sheer mountain face brackets the pond to the east and a field of
lush green grass lines the west.  The field can't be entered though,
some sort of invisible wall prevents any travel in that direction.  At
times the field shimmers and the vague outlines of a magificent tower
appear, but the vision quickly fades and only the grass remains.  The
moat continues to the north and south.

   Nothing about this strange moat-like pond is normal.  Even the air
as a strange magical quality to it.  Strange amorphous shapes move
through the water with the ease of fish.  An invisible wall of some
sort prevents any travel into the field to the west and there is an
unclimbable mountain face to the north.  The moat continues to the
north and south.

&+BOn a Strange Moat&N~
   The mountains to the north and east create a certain amount of shade
here, and these strange shadows help make the outline of a strange
shimmering tower visible to the southwest.  As the light changes, the
image shifts, sometimes revealing only a field of grass.  Light passes
straight through the image, or at least appears to, leading anyone
seeing it to question whether anything they are seeing is real.  Water
churns here as currents from both the south and west collide and swirl
in an angry mess, and strange amorphous shapes slide through the water
like ghostly fish.  The moat continues to the south and west.

&+BOn a Strange Moat&N~
   Many ages ago something was carved into the stone wall of the
mountain to the north, but time has erased all but a few traces of the
message, leaving nothing comprehensible behind.  An invisible wall of
some sort to the south prevents reaching the field of grass that lies
beyond.  The grass itself is an oddity, it sways as if in a breeze, but
there is no wind here, leading one to question whether the grass is
real.  The moat continues to the east and west.

   Nothing here seems right.  A field of grass to the south is clearly
surrounded by this strange moat-like pond, but the field itself is
unapproachable.  There is a wall that can be felt, but not seen, at the
edge of the field preventing any exit from the moat to the field.  When
one looks more closely at the field, the shadows cast by the
surrounding mountains don't seem quite right and sometimes there is the
shimmering image of a magificent tower which quickly fades.  Strange
amorphous shapes can be seen traveling through the water which
continues to the east and west.

   Water churns here as it seems to head both east and south.  It is as
if the water is rising up from beneath the ground and traveling outward
through the confines of this strange moat.  Disconcerting amorphous
shapes travel through the water like strange shadows, and the
shimmering image of a tremendous tower can be seen to the southeast.
Everything about this place has an eerie quality.  The only way to
leave is to travel along the moat to the south or east.

   Further to the south and east a forest can be seen, and to the west
there is a small square field that is enclosed by this odd square-
shaped pond.  The pond would appear to be more of a moat surrounding
the field. When the field itself is studied closely the shimmering
image of a tremendous tower comes and goes, leading one to wonder which
image is real.  An invisible wall of some sort blocks any exit onto the
field to the west and a jagged mountain to the east blocks any exit
there.  The moat continues to the north and south.

&+WOn a Translucent Drawbridge&N~
   The drawbridge, though clearly solid, is so translucent that one can
clearly see the moat beneath it.  There is nothing here to prevent one
from falling over the edge, yet the drawbridge is wide enough that this
is not a real worry.  What is troubling is the way the entryway to the
north shimmers and glows.  What once appeared to be a mountian now reveals
itself as a magnificent translucent tower.  The image of the tower
itself is difficult to look at, it shimmers and changes before one's
eyes, as does the wide doorway that enters the tower to the north.
There is an eerie, ancient feel to this place, and the distinct
impression that something is terribly wrong.  Words have been written on
the transparent bridge in blood, hovering there in a ghostly fashion.
The message they leave reads,&+r "All who enter the tower to the north shall&N
&+rdie horrible deaths.  Even the greatest shall die, flee now while you can."&N

   Odd prisms of some strange translucent green material have been mounted
on pillars that extend off in every direction.  The prisms shed a strange,
faint light that gives everything an eerie glow.  Twisted shapes appear to
be trapped within the prisms, struggling to break free.  Everything has an
incredibly ancient feel to it, yet the floors are free of dust and show no

has left behind something dark and sinister, it is as if the maze itself is
alive and breathing.  Wide pillared openings extend in every direction.

&+WA Room of Tranlucent Pillars&N~
   The ceiling of this strange room is shrouded in some sort of strange
twisting light.  Faint light appears to shift and change colors because the
triangular pillars that stand throughout the huge room act like prisms,
twisting the light and separating it into different colors.  It is almost
painful to try to make out clear images within the odd translucent pillars,
and dizzying to look upward and the constantly shifting ceiling.  The only
solid thing here is the floor, and even it has a certain fogginess to it
that leaves one feeling as if they are walking on air.  Thin fragile-
looking steps make up a narrow spiral staircase that leads upward and short
hallways extend off in every direction into strangely colored rooms.

&+WIn a &+RRed Hued&N &+WEntryway&N~
   Nothing in this place seems quite normal, a strange fog made up of
swirling lights appears to cover everything.  In any normal place the
massive open doorway to the south would lead out of this place, but the
haze of faint swirling light around it makes one wonder if it, or even this
room itself is real.  The light, though faint, has a red hue to it that
gives the impression that a great deal of blood was once shed here.
Despite its spotlessness, this place has an incredibly ancient feel to it.
Something here is corrupt and impure, perhaps it is the entire structure
itself.  A hazy doorway to the south appears to lead out of the tower and
short hallways lead off in every other direction.

   Circle-shaped, the door to the west is odd-looking even without its
strange translucent green color.  As the faint light hits the walls and
pillars that surround the room it is split and twisted leaving only a faint
greenish cast to everything that is here.  Something about the odd green
door appears to attract the green color, even absorb it.  Words have been
printed on the door in the form of some sort of rhyme or riddle, though
what they mean is not really clear.  Hallways continue to the north and
west.

&+LA Corridor of Terrifying &+WIllusions&N~
   The walls here are made of some strange translucent material that tends
to bend and twist light into terrifying forms, sometimes dragons, sometimes
snarling black unicorns.  When one stares at the western wall long enough
it almost appears that it is a window into another twisted dimension.
Sometimes the strange shapes appear to leap straight through the wall to
attack one's senses.  Light, no matter how faint, hits the walls and odd
pillars in the room and is separated into its different colors, all of
which bend and twist creating an odd mist of color.  A hallway continues to
the north and a large entryway of some sort is to the east.

&+bBy the Wall of the &+BBlue Dragon&N~
   Light here is broken and twisted until only faint blue light remains, a
light which is absorbed by the translucent wall to the north, a wall that
has a tremendous carving of a blue dragon.  Twisting light makes the
carving, which is realistic enough to begin with, seem to breathe and move.
There is a life and evilness to the carving that is unmistakeable.  Like
most of the tower, strange mists of twisting light cover the floor and
ceiling, leading one to wonder if any of this truely exists.  Strange
hallways shrouded in twisting light appear to extend to the south and east.

&+GIn an Open field&N~
   Thin, tall grasses line the field as far as the eye can see.  Invisible
walls of some sort prevent any travel to the north, south, or east making
one wonder if the field is real.  The grass growing here appears to be real
enough, yet the invisible walls and the circular green door that stands in
empty air to the west suggest it could just be an illusion.  Words stand
out in the air near the eastern wall, or where there must be some sort of
invisible barrier.  The riddle they present is strange and almost
incoherent, yet perhaps within them there is a clue as to what is going on
here.  Despite the way the field appears to extend to every horizon, the
only way not blocked by invisible barriers is through the green door to the
west.

&+WBefore a &+rBlood Red&+W Door&N~
   The lighting here is vague and hazy because the prisms built into the
pillars and even the walls themselves split any light that is here into its
many colors.  Light is diminished though, making even once bright colors
dark and almost tainted with some vague, undefinable evil.  Shapes twist
and struggle within the translucent walls and pillars seemingly to no
avail.  A door to the east looks too large and heavy for a single person to
move alone, yet, despite its solid appearance, it also has an almost
translucent quality to it that allows one to see strange shapes and colors
that are either moving within it or beyond it.

   Standing against the odd translucent wall to the north is a small
fountain made of such clear material that only the water that flows through
it is visible.  Along the floor and ceiling there is a vague haze of faint
light that curls into itself in such a way that is impossible to get a firm
grasp on where the floor, or ceiling, actually are.  At odd intervals, the
distant chirping of a bird can be heard, a sound that is totally out of
place here, which alone created worry rather than peaceful feelings when
one hears it.

   A smooth slide leads downward in a tight spiral from here, it is
impossible to see how far down it goes.  Light swirls below, looking like a
river of hazy spirits and ghosts struggling to get free.  Grotesque shapes
appear to be trapped in the translucent walls that surround this small
space.  The walls themselves seem to absorb and divide light as if they
were prisms, faintly glowing as if lit from within.  A slippery looking
slide leads downward into a haze of swirling light and there are no other
exits.

   There is the distinct, though ghostly, impression that something
incredibly terrible once happened here.  Even the translucent walls are
cloudier here than elsewhere in the tower, giving the room an yellowish
cast which isn't effected by any other lights that are brought here.
Strange shapes within the walls struggle to escape their confinement.
There is an eerie silence here, a silence that's extremely disturbing at some
sub-conscious level.  Hallways extend to the south and west.

   The faint lighting here is due to the strange mist that seems to drape
everything in the area.  No moisture comes from this strange fog, instead it
appears to be made up of different colors of light that seem to be
attempting to join together, creating swirls and eddies of faint light that
act more like water than air or light.  Nothing above or below can be made
out through the strange mist, and, though walls to the sides can be felt,
even bright light can't penetrate the mist enough to get a good look at what
they are made of.  The staircase curves as it heads both upward and downward

&+gA Landing Draped with Green Mist&N~
   An odd circular stairway climbs both up and down from this point, cloaked
in brightly colored mists that seem to be almost alive as they swirl
together.  The landing is open in every direction, but a green mist is
draped over everything in the area making it difficult to see where any of
the passages may lead.  Odors of death and decay hang in the air here, yet
the area is spotless revealing no source for the repugnant smells.  An odd
mist made of faint light cloaks exits which appear to lead in every
direction.

   As one enters, the mists fade away revealing a dimly lit room with
strange translucent walls.  Images dissappear and reappear within the
strange walls, images of distant planes and lands, as well as images of
strange and twisted creatures.  The images move soundlessly through the
walls merging with each other to form new and different images.  Glowing
letters float in the air near the eastern wall proclaiming, &+W"Welcome to the&N
&+WAlcove of Worlds."&N  There are other letters that appear at times but they
are difficult to read and appear to be in some ancient and forgotten
language.  The only exit is into the strange mists that lie beyond the huge
arched doorway to the west.

the east stands out like a beacon in the otherwise dark room.  More highly
polished and smooth than even the finest weapons, the door has an odd
magical quality to it that makes it glow with a faint blue light.  All light
shed by the door, like all light in the room, is absorbed and torn into its
component colors by the strange transparent walls and pillars.  The vague
light that is released flows through the air like some strange liquid that
is unaffected by gravity.

   Faint mists made of colored light cloak everything in the room, giving
everything a disconcerting hazy appearance.  An ancient bed stands against
the mist-cloaked eastern wall looking well-kept and ready for a tired guest.
Though the bed and small table and chairs are clearly extremely old, they
have been perfectly preserved and appear to be as sturdy as the day they
were first made.  No matter how close one gets to the furniture the strange
mist cloaks it, preventing any proper inspection of the ornate carvings that
cover them.  A strange, high-polished steel door in the western wall adds
its own faint glow to the room but provides no real ability to make out its
finer details.  The steel door appears to be the only exit.

   Long sofas and wide chairs have been spaced throughout the room.  Though
the furniture must have been quite colorful at some time in the past, all
the color seems to have been drained from it leaving everything looking drab
and gray, even when compared to the faintly colored mist that hangs over
everything.  Everything here is spotless, as if it was cleaned just an hour
ago, yet there is an odor of age and death that clings to the air here.  Odd
translucent walls block the way to the south and west but hallways continue
to the north and east.

Dark veins run through the marble making it look like stone that was once
brightly colored but that has since had all the color drained from it
leaving it dark and forbidding.  Hallways continue to the south and east and
the marble door blocks the way to the north.

   Everything in the room is coated with layers of dried blood.  Unlike most
other rooms in the tower, this room is a complete mess.  Whoever or whatever
has cleaned the rest of the tower has done no work here for many years.
Everything here is devoid of any real color, only the topmost layers of
dried blood have any color at all, and even that color is slowly fading to
black.  There is a faint aroma of molten copper but its source is unclear.
The only exit is the gray marble door to the south.

   Translucent walls to the north, east, and west absorb most light brought

light in a strange misty form.  Different colored mists swirl as they try to
rejoin but seem unable to meld together.  A small niche in the wall was
clearly designed to hold some sort of statue but nothing stands there now,
not even dust.  The only exit from this small unadorned alcove is to the
south.

   Once used to store things for the guests or owners of this strange place,
the closet is now barren, devoid of anything, even the hint of color.  Even
the walls here are duller and less translucent than in other parts of the

the faint, colored mist that can be seen everywhere in the tower.

   The floor here is of the clearest crystal, glowing with an inner magical
light.  Despite the clarity of the floor, mists below it obscure clear
vision of what is below the landing or even what might be on the stairway
that curves downward into strange colored mists.  Windowless walls of some
ancient gray stone surround the landing revealing only a single door to the
north.  Though the tower itself is quite strange, the door is of plain
ebonwood unadorned with even the simplest of engravings.  Something about
the door, perhaps its normalcy within a tower tainted by madness, is
strangely forbidding.  The dark wood of the door hints of death and
everlasting darkness, even the colored mists so prevalent throughout the
tower shun the door.

   A brightly colored sofa and plush over-stuffed chair sit here, somehow
making the room look warm and inviting.  There is something here though, a
ghostly awkward feeling that hints of madness and evil.  A once beautiful
tapestry hanging from the western wall has been shredded to the point of
complete destruction, all that remains are bare threads clinging to the wall
and piles of shredded cloth on the ground.  The sofa and chair look quite
inviting, but there is something about this room that suggests one remain
wary.  A curtain covers a doorway to the north and an open doorway to the
east leads into a small study of some sort.

   Though once quite elegant and beatiful, this room has become dusty and
ancient over time.  A window in the northern wall looks out at a steep
mountain face, unfortunately, the window has been set so far back into the
tower that nothing else can be seen.  A lovely canopied bed has been pushed
into the northwestern corner to make room for an elegantly carved wooden
casket.  The bed is the only piece of furniture that has withstood the test
of time and abuse, even the heavy ebonwood dresser leans slightly to one
side due to a broken leg.  A black curtain covers the small doorway to the
south and there are no other exits.

   The light here is almost blinding, it is almost as if the walls of the

everything in clear view.  Bookcases line the walls, but most of the books
have been ravaged by time, decaying to the point that most lie in piles of
dust.  Though a few tomes may have survived the years well enough to be
readable, it is doubtful that anything here could be of much use.

   Thin, tall grasses line the field as far as the eye can see.  Despite the
height of the grass one would expect to be able to see mountains or some
sort of landmarks in the distance.  Instead, the grass stretches toward the
horizon where there is a hazy border between sky and ground.  Though the sun
is high above, the light that reaches the ground here is vague and
misleading, making one wonder if anything here is real.  A circular green
door to the east stands in mid-air, sealed to some sort of invisible wall.
Before the door there is an odd green pedestal that even the tall grasses
avoid.  An invisible barrier prevents any travel to the east but the field
continues to the north, south, and west.

&+GIn an Open field&N~
   Thin, tall grasses line the field as far as the eye can see.  Despite the
height of the grass one would expect to be able to see mountains or some
sort of landmarks in the distance.  Instead, the grass stretches toward the
horizen where there is a hazy border between sky and ground.  Though the sun
is high above, the light that reaches the ground here is vague and
misleading, making one wonder if anything here is real.  Invisible walls or
barriers have been erected to the north and east preventing any travel in
those directions.  The grass beyond the barriers is tall enough to prevent
seeing much else in the distance.

&+BA Room of Blue Mist&N~
   &+BMagic is so powerful here that it causes one's hair to stand on end.  The&N
&+Bblue mists that curl together here have a power all their own.  When the&N
&+Broom is entered they slowly form into tiny blue dragons that match the odd&N
&+Bcarvings that can be barely made out in the mist-draped walls.  The magic of&N
&+Bthe mist, and even the room itself is of a power beyond even the wisest of&N
&+Bmortal mages, yet someone or something has created this place.  The wall to&N
&+Bthe east has a large bas relief carving of a blue dragon that has been&N
&+Bcloaked in swirling blue mist making it seem almost alive.  There appear to&N
&+Bbe no obvious exits here but the swirling mist could cloak even the most&N
&+Bobvious of doorways.&N

The wall to the east shows a beautiful bas relief of a blue dragon straining
to escape the wall and enter the room.  Whatever material has been used in
the creation of these walls and the carvings that have been made in them has
a special power of its own, the large dragon in the eastern wall and the
smaller dragons carved into the other walls shimmer as if they are alive and
ready to fight.

&+gBeneath a Majestic Oak Tree&N~
   The massive tree here is a welcome relief to most of the odd sights of
the tower.  There is no question, well, almost no question, that it is real,
and solid.  The texture of the rough bark is a comfort to most travelers,
feeling far more real and tangible than most things found within the tower.
In fact, the forest that extends in every direction appears to be far safer
and calmer than that insane place.  Unfortunately, invisible barriers,
though soft and stretchable, block travel in any direction.  The only way
out of the forest appears to be to enter the doorway into the tree itself to
the west.

This massive door has clearly been beaten upon quite often by the denizens of
this part of hell.  Despite that fact, it has clearly withstood all assaults.
There is a faint magical aura to the door that suggests the 'key' to opening
it might not be a physical key at all, perhaps it is a magical device, or
something as simple as a magical keyword.

   This room, like many of the strange rooms throughout the tower, is cloaked
in mist.  What is quite different however, is that this mist has a much more
tangible odor to it, the odor of sulfer and brimstone.  The only exit here is
through the large iron door to the east, upon which has been written a strange,
cryptic message.  Mist swirls everywhere in the room making any attempt to make
out details quite futile.

itself doesn't really exist.  Even the presence or absence of a floor can be
called into question.  There may be walls here, then again there may not, a
step in any particular direction doesn't so much as run into resistance.
Movement is apparently just ineffective, leaving one where they stand rather
than where they thought they would be.

   The walls, floor, and ceiling of this room have been cloaked in a woven
carpet of living flowers.  In the center of the room is a desk and a chair,
both of which shed a magificent light that has helped the flowers grow.  It
is very clear that powerful magic has been at work here, probably to keep the
strangeness of the rest of the tower at bay.  The flowers add a sweet scent
to the air, a scent of life, something that is difficult to find in the mist
enshrouded hallways of the tower.
