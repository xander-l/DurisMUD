  Here exists a small three by three room covered in cobwebs and dust.
The room is very humid and reeks with fumes of decay and death. Many
corpses of adventurers who have successfully sneaked passed the chaos
hound lie scattered on the ground.  Thousands of maggots and mice roam
the ground here searching for food.   The only exit is the one south
leading back to the Cavern of the Brave.

practicing their evil way of life.  There are exits to the north and south

their home. Citizens of the Shady Grove can been seen running about tending
to their business.  They move quickly through the streets trying to
stay away from the vile of the city. The black obsidian gates closes off

city  from unlawful entry. Eyes from above the city wall watch and mark
your every move. There are exits to the north, east, and south leading
into various parts of the city.  The exit beyond the east gates leads into
the outside world.

&+BThe Way of the Knife&N~
   This pathway is smaller than the main streets of the Keep.  Many of the
poor and the unfortunate flock to the slums along this pathway.  The Way of
the Knife runs along side the south granite wall of the city. Many vile
citizens of the Keep practice the ways of life infront of the many sentry
posts which can be seen along parts of the wall.  Dark shady thiefs and
meanacing assassins can be slightly seen in the shadows of the many buildings
waiting for the right moment to inflict their will. There are exits east and
west along this pathway.

&+WBefore the Ramparts that Lead to the South Gates of Shady Grove&n~
&+yA massive &+bmoat &+ywas recently built before the gates. From within the deep moat,
&+ya long ramp leads upwards to the south gates of Shady Grove. The moat is
&+ycurrently dry...

&+W   Standing before the magnificent entryway into the city, one easily notices
&+Wthe many eyes watching from above.  These eyes of the sentries on the city wall
&+Wmark your entry into the city and keep an eye out for danger.  The gates to the
&+Wcity are large and black.  Constructed from black obsidian forged in the fiery
&+Wpits of a volcanoe, these gates have kept unwanted visitors out of the city. On
&+Wthe other side of the gates, many guards can be seen standing stern and
&+Wattending to their tasks at hand.

&+LThe Shady Grove &+gAuction &+LMound&N~
   &+LThis large inlet off of Peddler's way begins with a small wooden
&+Larch, most likely to direct the traffic flow of orcs in and out of
&+Lthe auction mound so that thieves are more readily scanned by
&+Lmerchants.  At the far eastern side of this lot lies a huge mound of
&+Lrocks and clay, bulked up over the years into somewhat of a large
&+Lhill, on which the auctioneer stands, barking out prices and items
&+Lfor sale.  A canopy made of four large wooden stalks, carrying a
&+Lburlap tarp, stands high above the auction mound, providing the
&+Lauctioneer with protection from the elements, as well as blocking
&+Lsight from possibile assassins.
