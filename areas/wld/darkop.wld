&+LWithin the &+WSt&+wai&+Lnl&+ces&+bs S&+Bte&+Cel &+LMaze&n~
&+L   Flawless stainless steel floors and ceilings extend out in all
&+Ldirections. There seems to be no visible means of support for the
&+Lceiling that hovers just eight feet above the floor. The air here
&+Lis cold and crisp, in spite the blanket of thick fog which covers
&+Lthe room. An eerie silence lingers about, as even footsteps can't
&+Lbe heard.
