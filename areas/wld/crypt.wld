&+yNarrow, Muddy Trail&n~
   This trail, heading roughly north-south, looks to have been created
over time by people and animals tramping over it.  To the west and east
stretch fields of tall, mostly dead grass, and to the south the trail
rejoins another.  North, the trail crests a hill, and to the south,
forest can be seen.

&+yBefore a Burnt-Out Bridge&n~
   The trail terminates here on a bluff that drops off steeply to the
north.  A bridge apparently once crossed a river running through the
narrow canyon, though it has since been burnt out, with only small
sections remaining intact on the north and south banks.  The river
itself flows from east to west, twisting its way throughout the canyon.
~

To the north is a twenty-foot gap between the two small segments of the bridge
remaining.  If someone wasn't to somehow prevent themselves, it may just hurt
to fall into the river below...  Owie.

A simple wooden bridge, it probably fulfilled its job well in sometime past.
Now, a burnt-out twenty foot gap with a thirty-foot drop below makes it rather
obvious that the bridge isn't quite doing as well as it used to.

west.

&+cIn Mid-Air Above a Gorge&n~
   The viewpoint from up here is rather frightening, hovering thirty
feet above a fairly fast-moving river below, flowing east-west.  To the
north and south are what remains of a bridge, now burnt out in the
middle.  Far off to the southwest and southeast can be seen seemingly
endless fields of grass, and to the north is what looks like a graveyard
circled by a ring of dense overgrowth.

&+bA Fast-Flowing River&n~
   The river flows here through a narrow, steep gorge, running down a
sharp incline from west to east.  The walls of the rocky gorge tower
about thirty feet above, blocking out much of the light filtering
down from above.  To the west, a small lake can be seen, and the rush
of flowing water is clearly audible.

&+yNorthern End of a Burnt-Out Bridge&n~
  What's left of a bridge lies here, a small segment of it still projecting
over the gorge to the south.  To the north, a small trail heads into a
thick forest, climbing a short rise.  A large plateau rises out of the
growth to the east, disappearing as quickly as it appears.

&+LShort Tunnel&n~
   A short tunnel of stone leads southwards here, filled about a foot
deep with fast-running water.  A spring bubbles up from the floor at a
surprisingly fast rate, causing a sizable amount of water to flow about
thirty feet before falling off the cliff face to the south.  It's not
easy to keep one's footing here; indeed, it is quite hard.

&+bA Small Lake&n~
   The river terminates here at a small lake, roughly fifty feet in
diameter.  The gorge towers over your head, nearly blocking out any
light coming from above.  Strangely, there is no visual release for
all the water flowing in from the river, though the bottom of this
tiny lake is not visible through the clear water..

   Here, beneath the water (about ten feet under) the tug of current

&+cAbove a Narrow Lagoon&n~
   From this vantage point, the view is incredible.  To the north, a
waterfall bursts from a tunnel in the sheer cliff, falling into a
lagoon thirty feet below.  Westward, the river flows through a narrow
canyon, terminating at a small lake.  Far to the north, a graveyard
can be seen surrounded by a vast forest.

&+bDeep, Narrow Lagoon&n~
   A waterfall falls from a height of about thirty feet here, spitting
out of a hole in a sheer cliff to the north.  The lagoon created by this
great outpouring of water is deep and narrow, causing a swift current
pushing southward.  The water is incredibly clear, allowing the rocky
bottom of the lagoon to be seen thirty feet below.  A gorge juts up to
the west and east, preventing travel in any direction but south.

to the north lies a small log cabin with a simple wooden door and chimney
made of stone.  Whoever lives there must have been doing so for quite a

   Inside, the cabin looks just as simple as it did from the outside.
Sparsely decorated with only a faded throw rug on the floor and a few
animal skins on the wall, almost everything in this cabin appears to
be utilitarian.  A wood stove sits in one corner (currently dormant),
and a rough mattress sits in another.  A shelf lines a nearby wall,
holding a few interesting-looking artifacts.

   To the north lies a large graveyard, populated with at least a

all growth stops at the edge of the graveyard, causing the dirt
to be barren and hard-packed.  Despite the fact that the graveyard
is clearly rather old, everything seems untouched.

here is very dry and hard-packed as though it hasn't rained in months,

Only eight feet on each side and six feet tall, the inside is tiny
compared to most.  In the center a small coffin sits atop a low
pedestal, probably intended for a young or short-raced person.
Sculpted gargoyle heads run at regular intervals along the walls,
alternatively grinning and hissing.

&+YNortheastern Corner of a Disorganized Banquet Hall&n~
&+y   This area is apparently a banquet hall, with large oaken tables
&+yand stools placed haphazardly about at various angles and heights.
&+yTo the south is a particularly large table that stretches the whole

&+MThe North End of a Long, Narrow Laboratory&n~
&+m   The most noticeable thing when first entering this long narrow room is the
&+mstrange stench.  The smell of rotting flesh intermingles with the scent of
&+mvinegar and the acidic smell of chemicals, creating a smell that had probably
&+mnot existed before some crazed or genius mind set up this testing grounds.

&+m   Long wooden counters line the west and east walls at just over waist height,
&+mcovered with strange glass containers mounted in racks and the occasional sink.
&+mIn the center of the room stands an island, slightly higher than the counters
&+mand covered with paperwork and the rare glass vial.

&+m   Most disturbing of all are four long tables that take up the rest of the
&+mfloorspace here in the northern section of the lab.  Three of them are covered
&+monly by clean white sheets, but the other houses what apparently was once a
&+mhuman body, now modified greatly beyond what it may have once been.

&+m   The body, a male, has had his legs replaced by those of a horse, sewn on at
&+mthe hip.  His arms, once no doubt those of a normal human, are now those of an
&+morc, joined just below the shoulder.  Most disturbing of all, the eyes have
&+mbeen gouged out, perhaps to be replaced by more 'advanced' organs later.
&+mOddly, the body does not seem to fester or rot, but looks perfectly preserved
&+mbeyond the fact that it has been horribly modified from what it once was.

&+MThe South End of a Long, Narrow Laboratory&n~
&+m   The southern section of the laboratory is laid out much the same as the
&+mnorthern end, with the exception that a staircase can be seen leading downwards
&+mto the south.  The odd smell persists here.

&+m   Long wooden counters line the west and east walls at just over waist height,
&+mcovered with strange glass containers mounted in racks and the occasional sink.
&+mIn the center of the room stands a small table, slightly higher than the
&+mcounters and covered with a few bits of paperwork.

&+m   Two long tables stand parallel to the west/east walls here, taking up the
&+mrest of the floorspace in the southern section of the lab.  One is covered only
&+mby a clean white sheet, but on the other lies what an elven body, seemingly
&+mperfectly preserved.

&+m   The body, that of a female, is that of an exceptionally beautiful elf, with
&+mpixie-like face, slim physique, and long silver hair.  The body, unlike that of
&+mthe man's, appears unravaged by the rigors of sitting in a coffin for years,
&+mmonths, or even weeks.  Upon closer inspection, the woman seems flawless in
&+mevery way, without a single blemish or unattractive physical quality.

light source is no more.

Inside a Small Air Pocket~
&+L   Air has gathered here in a small pocket, no more than three feet
&+Lwide and three feet high from the water's surface to the ceiling of
&+Lthe cavern.  A faint breeze can be felt through small cracks in the
&+Lwalls, bringing with them the faint scent of the outdoors.

&+Lacross at the widest point.  A small rocky outcropping can be seen
&+Lto the east, jutting darkly upward out of the flowing water.  To the
&+Least, the low roar of flowing water can be heard.
