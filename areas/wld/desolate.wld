&+yThe &+LRoad&+y to &+cDesolate&n~
&+y   Though the &+Lroad&+y remains the constant &+wgravel&+y path, that seems
&+yto be used quite frequently here, there is an obvious change in
&+ythe terrain just up ahead.  In contrast to the arid &+YCalimshan&+y, with
&+ya quick look before one, a large, lush, &+gforest&+y seems to spring
&+yup almost out of nowhere.  Though the &+Ydeep Calimshan&+y is quite a distance
&+yto the south, it is still strange to see so much greenery so
&+yquickly.  The &+Lroad&+y heads north.&n

&+yThe &+LRoad&+y to &+cDesolate&n~
&+y   The &+Lroad&+y continues here, now into and through the &+gforest&+y itself,
&+ythe &+gforest&+y that the village of &+cDesolate&+y rests peacefully in.  Many
&+yyears ago, before there even was a &+Lroad&+y, &+cDesolate&+y was just a small
&+ylogging camp, isolated and alone in the woods.  Now, it has become
&+yan extremely popular location for travellers and adventurers.  The
&+wgravel &+Lroad&+y leads north deeper into the &+gforest&+y.

&+y   The &+wgravel &+Lroad&+y continues here, with tall &+Wwillow&+y trees growing
&+yjust along the edge, half inside the dense &+gforest&+y and half out.  Wagon
&+ytracks and horse prints make for easy tracks in the gravel.  Squirrels
&+yand rabbits and other &+gforest&+y critters appear skitiring in and out
&+yof the tree line, and the noises of the &+gforest&+y are quickly becoming
&+ymuch louder.&n

&+yThe &+LRoad&+y to &+cDesolate&n~
&+y   The &+wgravel&+L road&+y turns east here as the &+gforest&+y suddenly seems to
&+yengulf everything around one.  The rocky earth of the road leading
&+yto the &+YSavannah&+y seems but a distant memory once at this turn in the
&+Lroad&+y, as the &+gforest&+y becomes so vibrant and alive.  It is hard to have
&+yeven imagined that there is an arid desert a short distance to the
&+ysouth.

&+gforest&+y the encompasses the village of &+cDesolate&+y and all the functions
&+ythat are held within.  &+WRabbits&+y and squirrels become more abundent,
&+yand the noises of the birds in the trees grows much louded.  Even
&+ythe smell of &+rcampfire &+Lsmoke&+y causes a twitch in the nose.  A wagon
&+yseems to have lost a wheel here while travelling north to the village.
&+yThe &+Lowner&+y stands next to the wagon looking rather annoyed with the

&+ycontinues to block the view of anything other than the road directly

&+yhere by multitudes of voices of many different languages, some shouting,

&+yfrightened of the noises coming from the nearby &+gforest&+y.&n

&+ybeaten &+wgravel &+Lroad&+y continues north and south, the east and west
&+yroutes aren't as kept up though still show heavy signs of travel.
&+yTo the south the terrain changes quickly, the &+gforest&+y that is
&+yaround this part vanishes quickly and is replaced by much less
&+yvegetation and much rockier soil.  There is a &+Wsign&+y placed beside
&+ythe &+Lroad&+y here that has directions on it.&n

&+y   The &+Lroad&+y continues in a northernly direction after the &+Wintersection&+y
&+yjust to the south and comes to a small hill.  The hill doesn't seem
&+yextremely steep from here, in fact, just by tilting ones head up one
&+ycan see the top, and since the &+gforest&+y becomes too dense in other
&+ydirections, the road was built over the hill and not around it.&n

&+gsurrounds this entire area.  The &+cjousting &+Lgrounds&+g lie just to the
&+geast of here, and &+cspectators&+g and travellers come from all over the
&+gworld to watch.  There are shouts and cheering echoing throughout
&+gthis part of the forest, indicating just how important this &+cjousting&n
&+gmatch is.&n

&+ystations.  The gates, like the wall and the majority of the village
&+yitself is all made from &+Woak&+y timber, thick strong wood, perfect
&+yfor buildings.  There is a &+Wsign&+y just above the gates that reads:&n
              &+WNo Magic Allowed Within City Proper.&n
&+y   One would expect that the several guards on post here at the gates

&+cSpectators Row&n~
&+g   This is the area of the &+cjousting&+L grounds&+g where the &+cspectators&+g
&+gcome stands and watch.  It runs parallel the &+cjousting &+ypath&+g, which
&+glies just north, and is separated by a long &+Ygolden bar&+g, both to
&+gkeep the &+cspectators&+g out and keep the competitors in.  People of
&+gall cultures and races come here during the competition to watch
&+gthe world's best &+cjousters&+g.  It is not uncommon to see an &+LOrc&+g from
&+LShady &+gGrove and a &+cHuman&+g from &+WTharnadia&+g here at the same time,
&+gcheering for the same knight.

&+LAt an Ancient Doorway&n~
&+L   The black, spiraling staircase comes to an end here with the
&+La huge black door blocking the exit any further down.  The door
&+Litself seems incredibly old, forgotton here in the depths of the
&+Learth over time, yet also seems to be in fairly good condition. It
&+Lis unclear on when someone was last down here, though the stair-
&+Lcase is kept clear of any dust or soil and the hinges on the
&+Ldoor itself seem well oiled, it is obvious this is not a place
&+Lmany travellers venture into.&n

&+LInside the &+RMas&+Wter's&+L Chamber&n~
&+L   Standing within the ancient burial chamber of the &+RMas&+Wters&+L, perhaps
&+Lthe greatest fighters in known history one becomes overwhelmed with
&+Lfeelings of insecurity.  Even the tiniest brain of the largest ogre
&+Lhas to register the sheer power that once existed in these very
&+Lrooms.  Though the bodies are all gone, the coffins remain, as a
&+Ltestament of their strength over death.  Writing on ancient piece
&+Lof &+yparchment&+L, barely readable, has been place on the northern
&+Lwall.&n

&+geven the faintest trail compared to what there was earlier.  The
&+gonly way to travel is the direction that the least foliage grows,
&+gand even then its quite difficult.  The trees create almost a
&+gwall of growth, and huge prickly bushes cut and scrape at the

&+yThe Bridge Between &+WTowers&n~
&+y   This is the sky bridge that runs between the two watch towers
&+yjust over the main &+Lgates&+y of &+cDesolate&+y.  It is completely enclosed other
&+ythan tiny holes carved into both the front and back walls, so &+Warchers&n
&+ycan still properly fire out.  The bridge is built from the same strong
&+Woak&+y that is used through the village.  It is quite sturdy and able
&+yto hold alot of wieght.  At first glance from below on the &+Lroad&+y,
&+ythe twin watch towers and the bridge appear to look like a large
&+yH with the &+Lgates&+y of the village open.  An &+Warcher&+y captain and a
&+ycouple of his men stand on guard at all times here.&n

&+yin the region, and this small, yet rowdy, pub is a prime example of
&+ythe type of people that live here.  They are all hard working folk
&+ywho enjoy their time off immensely, and as there isn't that much
&+yrecreational activities in the village itself, most all the people
&+yend up here, at the Lustful Logger, at least once a day.  Up a

&+cThe Desolate &+LMarket&n~
&+y   This is the &+cDesolate &+LMarket Place&+y.  It is one of the busier
&+ylocations within the village, and just as the Lustful Logger pub
&+ygets the majority of the citizens of &+cDesolate&+y, the &+Lmarket place&n
&+ygets very many tourists, delegates, and adventurers.  Most everyone
&+ywill stop by the &+Lmarket place&+y at least once during a trip to

&+yThe &+LBank&+y of &+cDesolate&n~
&+y   This is the local bank.  The building itself is built from the
&+ysolid &+Woak&+y that most the entire village has been built from.   The
&+ybanker sits behind a long counter that divides the room in two,
&+ywith the side opposite the door being where the safes and money
&+yis kept.  On the western wall hangs a large painting, done locally
&+yhere by the &+Lblacksmith's&+y wife, depicting the village of &+cDesolate&n
&+yin its early years.  The door to &+cMain Street&+y is to the north.&n

&+yallow magic within its boundaries, the &+cclerics&+y come here to
&+ypractices their arts.   The &+Wtemple&+y itself is cylindrical in
&+yshape with a high, pointed ceiling.  There is only enough room
&+yfor a few people in here at one time comfortably, and a single
&+yaltar against the far wall.  The door to the west leads back

&+yA Long Pier&n~
&+y   This pier was built orginally by &+cDesolate&+y locals, and has been
&+ybuilt with the same excellent craftsmanship as the village itself.
&+ySeveral months ago, the ingenious &+LOrcs&+y from &+WStorm &+CPo&+crt&+y found out
&+yabout this location and decided it would make a good outpost for
&+ythem.  Now the pier is crawling with &+LOrc&+W sailors&+y and &+rsoldiers&+y and
&+yis quite busy with mass of ocean going vessels bound for &+WStorm
&+CPo&+crt&+y itself and other locations.&n

&+yInside a &+LSoldier's&+y Tent&n~
&+y   This is the inside of a tent put up by the &+LOrc&+y soldiers.  It
&+yserves a intermediate barracks while the other &+LOrcs&+y take time to
&+ybuilt a more permanent outpost.  The tent can fit easily sleep
&+ysix &+LOrcs&+y, and has a small table set up for when the soldiers eat.
&+yThe exit to the east leads back to the &+Ybeach&+y.&n

&+yInside the &+WCaptain's&+y Tent&n~
&+y   This is the inside of a tent put up by the &+LOrc&+y soldiers.  It
&+yserves a intermediate barracks while the other &+LOrcs&+y take time to
&+ybuilt a more permanent outpost.  The tent can fit easily sleep six
&+LOrcs&+y, and has a small table set up for when the soldiers eat. The
&+WCaptain's&+y tent is slightly bigger than the others set up on the
&+Ybeach&+y, giving this high ranking &+LOrc&+y a more comfortable area for him
&+yand his bodyguards.  On the table here, several tactical maps of the
&+yarea have been laid out for stragetic planning. The exit to the east
&+yleads back to the &+Ybeach&+y.&n

&+yA Ledge Overlooking the &+YBeach&n~
&+y   This is a rocky ledge that overlooks the &+Ybeach&+y just below,
&+yusually unacccessable due to the thick &+gfoliage&+y that grows to the
&+ysouth.  Once here, however, a good view can be seen not only of
&+ythe &+Ybeach&+y, but of the village of &+cDesolate&+y itself to the north, the
&+yhill the road goes over to the northwest, and the thick&+g forest
&+ythat encircles it all.  It is a rather serene location, yet
&+yoddly feels another presence nearby.&n
