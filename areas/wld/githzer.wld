&+LAdamantite Gates&N of an &+LOutpost Stronghold&N~
   &+LLarge towering adamantite bars bound together with strips of black metal
&+Lform the gates of this huge stronghold.  The walls of this black stronghold
&+Litself tower into the clouds, reaching beyond visability from a grounded
&+Lstandpoint.  Deep unhuman chants can be heard echoed through the gates.
&+LThis point is a heavily guarded area, from which the inhabitants of the
&+Lstronghold scan for unwanted people. South leads back to the surroundings.

&NIntersection in &+Lthe Stronghold&N~
   &+LDirectly south of here rest the towering adamantite gates.  This point
&+Lis the most traveled within the entire stronghold, due to the number of
&+Lfootprint impressions in the rug below.  A single corridor leads east and
&+Lwest from this point.  Low unhuman chants and moans can be heard echoing
&+Lthrough the hallways. There are no lights or bright objects of any kind
&+Lin the surrounding area, and the ceiling is so high that the top of it
&+Lpeaks out of visability into darkness above.

&+LAn Adamantite Corridor&N~
   &+LThis black corridor seems to go forever in one direction, even though it
&+Lvisabilty turns at the corners of the stronghold.  It would seem that one
&+Leven with intense ultravision would have a troubled time seeing in the
&+Ldarkness of this stronghold.  Low chants and moans grow louder as the
&+Lcorridors progress northward through the fortress.  The black surroundings
&+Lof the adamantite is almost mezmorizing, as there is nothing on the walls.

&+Lroom, located under the west wing sleeping chamber.  But obviously it has
&+Lbeen recently turned otherwise.  The adamantite panel above from here
&+Lcarelessly drips blood from above.  A stack of naked, dead githzerai lies
&+Lon top of a pile of bloodied blankets and cushioned mats.  This room has
&+Lobviously been recently over-run without the githzerai noticing yet.

&+LA &+CSp&+che&+Lre &+co&+Lf &+WAir &+Li&+cn &+CLi&+cmbo~
   A large bubble of air floats here in limbo.  The edge of the bubble is
continually distorted, constantly shifting and reforming.  Within the bubble
is some very clean and clear, cold air.  It almost seems that a small chunk
of the Elemental Plane of Air has formed here.  A constant gushing sound,
almost like running water, can be heard coming from this sphere as the rim
coelesces onto itself.

   &+LA large globe, much like a chunk of the astral plane, has drifted into

&+Laround the outside of the globe, crackling slightly.  The upper and lower
&+LLimbo shelf clouds can be seen rumbling in the distances, with vertical
&+Lshafts of energy occasionally igniting.  The winds of Limbo roar in an
&+Leerie hum, almost high in pitch, but yet very low.  This globe of astral
&+Lhas a darker hue to it then the surroundings.  It also makes one feel
&+Lmore off his feet then the rest of the surroundings.

&+LThe &+cSpirit&+L Chamber of the Spell Master&N~
   &+LThis is the chamber of the high githzerai master of incantations.
&+LThe chamber itself is a large adamantite room.  Large windows in the
&+Lnorthern wall look over the chaotic plane of Limbo.  A huge chest
&+Lin the corner of the room covered strangely with tapestries and pillows
&+Lseems to hide something.  There is no bed or desk in this room, and
&+Lthe only furniture is a large adamantite altar, resting on a small
&+Lstairway'd platform in the center of the room.

&+cwith a drawn out and deeply blurred sound, making it difficult to understand

&+cseen.  What appears to be miles away can actually be only feet away.

&+Lthese &+mrunes&+L and &+bsymbolic &+Linscriptions that happen to be repeated
&+Lover and over.

&+LThe first of these markings appears to be of Zerthimon, the great God of
&+Lthe Githzerai and their protector.  However the second marking is an image
&+Lof &+rdeath&+L and failure, with a small inscription of the king of these
&+LGithzerai, Tayr-Dryn at the center of the &+rdeath&+L symbol.

   &+LThese first two markings appear to be on the western side of both the
&+Lfloor and doorway.  The eastern side, however, appears to have repeated
&+Lmarkings of the blood-enemy cousins, the Githyanki.  Tied in with these
&+Limages are inscriptions regarding world domination and the never-ending
&+Lblood feud between these two races.

   &+LIt is within the center, however, that the images of defeat and the
&+Linscriptions of world domination seem to be connected.  Located on the
&+Lcenter portion of the doorway and the walkway appears to be symbols of
&+La much greater threat then the Githyanki: the tentacled slave-master race
&+Lof the &+millithids&+L.  It is by these &+mrunes&+L of the &+millithids &+Lthat the rest
&+Lof the &+bsymbols&+L are tied together.  According to this lore, it is the
&+Lpresence of the &+millithids&+L that has crippled the Githzerai's prime
&+Lplanar assaults, forcing them to reserve their main forces in &+CL&+cimbo&+L.
&+LThis fifth and final inscription, furthermore, also carries the insignia
&+Lof the Rrakkma, the great slayers of the &+millithids&+L and avatars of the
&+LGithzerai.  However, these &+mrunes&+L and &+bsymbols&+L may be all that is left
&+Lof these Githzerai saviors, as it is also inscribed that the Rrakkma will
&+Lbe extinct only until order is brought to the Githzerai people.  Balance
&+Lwill only occur when the wizard king of the Githzerai and Zerthimon, the
&+Lspirit guardian, have fused their power, rather then attempting to force
&+Lcontrol upon one another.

&+LA Gloomy Foyer in the Chapel&N~
   &+LThis dark adamantite chamber has four large pillars
&+Lsupporting the massive roof surrounding this foyer.  This
&+Lfoyer opens up to the north at a large fountain, spurting out deep
&+Land unpleasant-sounding fluids.  Further north is a large worship
&+Lhall that is too dark to make out clearly from this point.
&+LAll around the floor and steps leading down towards the worship
&+Lhall are many of the same &+mrunes&+L and &+bsymbols&+L as seen on the

&+Wstands on a pedestal that is about four feet high.  A king, with his
&+Whood draped loosely around his neck, with a small inscription.
           &+WThis inscription reads:
 &+rKezyr-Dryn, King of the Githzerai and Battle-Mage

&+WAn Elegant Hallway of &+WM&Nar&+Lb&+Wl&Ne &+Wand &+LAdamantite~
   &+WThis long and glorious hallway stretches quite long in this
&+Wportion of the githzerai fortress.  Although most parts of the
&+Wfortress seem to be &+Lcovered in darkness&+W, this particular hall-
&+Wway appears to be quite luminant and welcoming.  There are var-
&+Wious statuettes of past githzerai kings located every dozen
&+Wpaces in the center of this east-western hallway.  The floor is
&+Wmade of some sort of composite between &+Wm&Nar&+Lb&+Wl&Ne &+Wand &+Ladamantite&+W.

&+Lthrough this area, growing &+rheavier&+L and &+Mbrighter&+L to the north.
&+LA strange magical pull seems to attract magic towards the north,

&+Lalso appears to create some sort of order in this vast and shapeless
