A &+LFetid&n Crawlspace~
   The rocky ceiling comes down almost to the floor here. The air
is filled with a &+gdisgusting stench&n that emanates from somewhere
deeper within the cave. The floor is &+ysandy&n, and covered with
small bits of &+Rbloody&n fur and &+Wbones&n.

An Intersection In The Cave~
   This small, &+Lfetid&n cave splits into two parts here, a small &+Lhole
to the east, and to the north is a small room with a table. The ceiling is
low, but higher than in the entrance. Absolutely everywhere are small bits
and pieces of small animals in various states of decay, and the smell is
simply overpowering.

&+gGorblaat's &+LCorner~
    This small corner of the cave is absolutely packed with filth, with
stray pieces of &+crubbish&n, small bits of &+yfur&n, half-eaten &+Wrabbits&n,
and festering puddles of &+gvomit&n. The smell is simply overwhelmingly bad.
Despite all of that, whoever lives here has clearly made himself comfortable.

A &+rBloody &nKitchen~
  This area in the cave is completely dominated by a long wooden
table on the eastern side of the room. The top of the table is
completely packed with &+rbloody&n &+yfur&n, bits of &+Wbone&n,
and entire small &+Glizards&n, birds, and &+Wrabbits&n in various
states of decay. The stench is completely disgusting.

&+LRubbish Chute~
  This small area behind the table is used by the cave's inhabitant
as a rubbish chute, where anything that is no longer wanted is thrown
away to be forgotten. The floor is made up of a &+cmetal grate&n, which
itself is covered in bits of &+rblood&n and dried &+gvomit&n.

&+yA Small &+YFoyer&n~
&+y   This foyer is built of solid oak wood. There is nothing fancy
&+yabout it, just a simple room built for a simple function. In fact,
&+ythis entire cabin seems to have a very humble feeling to it. The
&+yfloors are plain and without carpets. The only decoration is a
&+ysimple &+Ydoormat &+ymade of hemp by the front door.&n

&+yfeet long. The walls are plain oak, just like the floors and
&+yceiling. A small table, complete with two chairs is to your

&+yand even thrive. You can see small mounds in the dunes,

&+Rthis whole strip of land, one cannot but wonder what mage owned this
&+Rtower and whatever came of this wizard, or how his tower was destroyed.
&+RWhat sits here now, however, is the ancient, foregotten ruins of some-

&+WA Windy Ridge on a Trail in the Mountain Peaks~
   &+WThe peaks of this mountain range touch the sky and cut the clouds with their
&+Wsharp, abrupt ridges.  The trail here turns and twists with the natural progression
&+Wof the mountain.  There are bits of grass and moss that have grown onto the

   A wide, spacious clearing sits encircled in a crown of thorny rocks, atop these
Eagle Ridge Mountains.  The trail below winds chaotically around the rocks of these
mountains until it disappears into the clouds.  As this clearing sits well above the

sitting in shadows of others have a small bit of snow sitting refrigerated by the
shadows coolness.  This clearing sits next to a huge boulder to the west, and a
rocky descent north of here.
