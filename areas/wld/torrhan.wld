&+bThe Market Square&n~
&+c   Many booths and stands surround you, filled with fruits, vegetables,
&+cbreads, pastries, and other fine foods.  Vendors walk about shouting out
&+cor showing off their wares.  An assortment of people can be found here -
&+Ydwarves&+c, elves, &+Chumans&+c, &+yhalflings&+c, &+Rgnomes&+c.  Sailors and merchants push
&+ctheir way through busily, attempting to reach their destination. Despite
&+cthe bustle of the city, though, a sense of uneasiness settles upon you.
&+cOn closer inspection, many of the stands appear to be empty and falling
&+capart, many of the buildings have begun to look unkept, dirty, or simply
&+cabandoned.  This same &+bmarket&+c only a year ago would have seen triple the
&+cnumber of people that fill it now.  The air is mixed with the &+Wsalty&+c scent
&+cof the &+Bsea&+c.  The great towers of the palace are visible to the north,
&+cthe docks and other shops line the street west, and a great school can
&+cbe seen towards the forest that lies east.&n

&+LA Dimly Lit Hallway&n~
&+m   Though it is very dim you can still make out the things in here,
&+mthough few.  This hallway is mostly bare, the walls painted a light
&+mgray and the floor carpeted in dark red.  The ceiling is high and the
&+monly light is a lamp hanging down.  The hallway comes to an end here,
&+mthe only exit leading west.&n

&+rA Large Room&n~
&+w   This room is large and spacious, the ceiling extending far above
&+wyou.  The floors are carpeted in a deep red, soft to the touch.  A
&+wlarge round table centers the room, a solitary chair on the north end
&+wand a few on the opposing side.  The lighting in here is very dim,
&+wcasting just enough light onto the paintings on the wall of detailed
&+wbattles, victories, and losses.  There are also paintings of people,
&+wsuch a beautiful druidess communing with nature or a strong sailor
&+wstanding upon a ship.  It's unclear just what this room is meant for,
&+wbut a sense of the mystic can be felt.&n

&+bFisherman and sailors make their way down the docks, hurrying to

&+Lbe founds on the dock, and despite its appearance from the outside
&+Lit looks very little like a warehouse in here.  Converted into a type
&+Lof office.  Four heavy wooden desks are placed towards the back,
&+Lvarious pictures of ocean landscapes and beautiful ships adorning the
&+Lscuffed walls.  Many hard wooden benches are pushed against the walls
&+Lfor those waiting to be seen.  Sailors of all ranks line up here

&+bwhen the massive, iron gates are closed.  Tall buildings and towers are
&+bvisible over the stone walls and the smell of freshly baked bread and
&+bfresh fruits wafts through here.  Far ahead the great palace of the King
&+bare visible, its tall towers extending towards the sky.  Despite the
&+bgreatness of this city, an unsual, uneasy feeling can be felt here, as if
&+bsomething has been lost here.  The massive gates lead into the main market
&+bof &+YTorrhan&+b, while a smooth stone path leads away from the city.&n

&+yforest once grew and flourished where the city now lies, but has since
&+ybeen pushed aside outside the city.  This path of dirt is obviously well
&+ytraveled, as roots and other plants have since given up trying to
&+yovergrow it and are now content to let those pass.  The forest is alive
&+ywith the sounds of creatures moving through the underbrush and the trees
&+yabove, the loud call of a bird sounds in the distance.  The bustle of
&+ythe city is still audible from here, though, a long street lies west,

&+gforest, with great trees on every side and the sun creeping through the
&+gdense canopy above, casting rays of light upon the ground.  The sounds of

&+yWithin A &+gTree&n~
&+y   It's dark within this hollowed tree, the only light filters through
&+ya few holes and cracks in the old trunk here and there.  The ground is
&+ycovered in a thick, matted carpet of leaves, twigs, and branches,
&+ycrunching as one walks around.  This tree must be incredibly old for
&+ybeing as large as it is.  The only exit is a small opening in the trunk
&+yto the south, leading back into the forest.&n

&+w   This path is well used, marking the travel of several villagers
&+wand travellers to and from the beach and streets.  A steep incline
&+wleads downwards towards the beach, cluttered by loose rocks and gravel,
&+wmaking the trip down slightly difficult.  From here, the ocean is
&+wvisible, stretching out westwards towards the horizon, while a long
&+wpier reaches across the waters not too far north.  The path continues
&+wboth up and down.&n

&+y   The steep incline ends abruptly here, the land flattened by years
&+yof high tides and weather.  Seashells, gravel, crabs, and other small
&+ycreatures have found their way onto the beach, causing one to watch
&+yclosely where they step.  When the sun shines high in the sky it warms
&+ythe sand, burning bare feet, while a cool breeze blows in from the sea.
&+yThe beach continues northwards towards the pier which extends out over
&+ythe water, while a sloping path leads back up to the street.&n

&+yA&+L Rocky&+y Beach&n~
&+y   The sand is hot against bare feet when the sun is high in the sky,
&+ycomforted only by the cool breeze that drifts by here.  A rocky wall
&+ybegins to extend upwards on the east side of the beach, allowing for
&+yonly a few dozen feet of sand to extend from the water.  The sand isn't
&+yquite as smooth and soft as one might expect, though, cluttered with
&+ybroken seashells and gravel washed up by the slow waves.  A long pier
&+yreaches out over the waters to the north of here, fishermen lining it
&+yin hopes of a good catch.  Towards the south a sloping path leads
&+yupwards onto the street.&n

&+LA Narrow Tunnel&n~
&+L    It is impossible to see here without some kind of light,
&+Leven too dark for shadows to emerge.  The walls of this tunnel
&+Lare slightly damp, and a shallow pool of water covers the ground.
&+LEchoes fill the area, caused by the ocean being so close
&+Las well as the bustle of the city above.  The tunnel continues
&+Lnorth and south.&n

&+yA&+L Rocky&+y Beach&n~
&+y   The scent of salt is strong here, mingled with the smell of freshly
&+ycaught fish drying in the sun.  Lazy waves wash up against the rocky
&+yshore, bringing in broken seashells, gravel, crabs, and other small
&+ycreatures of the sea.  The beach continues northwards towards the pier
&+ywhich extends out over the water, while the street leading to the docks
&+ylies south.&n

&+bThe Entrance to&+W King&+Y Torrhan's&+b Palace&n~
&+b   The entrance to the palace shines with a powerful magnificance.  The
&+bfloors are covered in gleaming, thick stone, and the sounds of footsteps
&+becho through the halls.  The ceiling is lifted high and bright candles
&+bsurround the circular walls.  The decay of the city has not entered here,
&+bas everything is perfectly in place and beautiful - so perfect it wouldn't
&+bbe a surprise if magic had something to do with it.  A wide hallyway leads
&+bboth to the right and left from here, while far north lies the throne room
&+bof &+WKing &+YTorrhan&+b.  The palace gates lead back south into the city.&n

&+yA &+LRocky&+y Path Towards the Pier&n~
&+w   The beach comes to an end here, ending on a wooden platform that
&+wmarks the beginning of the pier.  This area is crowded at all times
&+wof the day, but even more so in the middle of the afternoons and the
&+wsun is high in the sky.  The smell of freshly caught fish drying on
&+wthe pier becomes very strong here, mingled in with the salty scent of
&+wthe sea that drifts by with the breeze.  The pier itself extends out
&+wto the west, while the beach continues on southward.&n
