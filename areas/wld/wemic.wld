&+yA Change in the Path~
&+y The road changes a bit here, turning to a small path that leads right
&+yup to a small tribal village. The village can be seen from this view
&+ypoint, and doesn't look like anything that spectacular. There are
&+yfootprints all through the sands leading up to the village. The village
&+yseems to of been built around some large boulders, probably where a
&+ysmall spring can be found. The path of weeds leads off to the east.

&+YA Path Through the Sands~
&+y This small path weaves in and out of huts, and is well traveled, almost
&+yas much as the central path. Small scaprs off meat are left out for
&+ythe local animals, or even the children. The sky beats down on the sand
&+yall day so much that hardly any wemic roam about, even though their
&+ythick animal paws can withstand the heat more than most other animals,
&+ythey still prefer to stay in the shade.

only a large hunk of black rock, placed in the center of the area. There
are several other rocks in the area where wemics can be seen listening to
their master preach about the happenings of the tribe. Along with all the
rocks around the area, the filth of the tribe has been well spread around
all over the place, from one of their great kills, to a challenge among
the youths.

huts in the area have been made to lean against.

to shutup the rest of the place from the sun and the wind. There are many
bones and such around the hut, including those of dwarves, humans, and
barbarians. There is a small whole in the back of the hut where waste is
busy being burried all the time. Ortaments and pottery decorate the hut.

which has gotten dirtied over time. The hut is made out of small scraps of
wood on the sides with snake skin covers all over the rest of the hut, and
a small snake skin flap, which doesn't do much to keep people out of the hut,
but helps to keep the amount of sand being kicked in, out. There are many
different kinds of pottery decorating the hut.

&+Bthere are still wemics goign to the watering whole for a cool dip or just

bat guano, and other yummy things. There are several charts and books all
over the room on how to conjure up different things, nothing too special,
but important to the wemic's none the less. There are also different charts
of the desert that don't really show much except the road, the jungle, and
the wemic village. Along with these spell components, there are several
beakers.
