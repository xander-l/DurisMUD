A &+bBlu&+Besto&+bne&n Street Called &+WCyraes Way&n~
   The main street in Ceothia, Cyraes Way, links the
north of the town the south.  Winding its way through
the center of town, it is the main thoroughfare for
merchants and the residents of the town.  Lining the
street are the fronts on houses and shops. True to the
standard in Ceothia the squat single story buildings,
give an impression of necessity, rather than grandure.

   Situated in the south-eastern part of Ceothia, this

of minor debris.  A constant damp covers everything, and
due to the buildings surrounding the alley little light
can get in to dry the moisture.

&+LA Dimly Lit Alley Way&n~
   Littered with rubbish and other less desirable
refuse, this dimly lit alley way is far from a place
to linger.  Surrounded by low level building, a small
amount of light manages to penetrate from above,
dimly lighting the littered floor.  Further down the
alley a squat shack can be seen, its ramshackle walls,
letting the light from within shine through.

&+yThe Entrance to the Stables of&n &+cCeothia&n~
   These large stables house many of the travelling
merchants horses.  Stalls line both sides of the stable
and down the center of the stable is a hitching post.
The floors are covered with fresh hay, and bags of grain
and meal can line the stall walls.  The walls of the
stable do not reach the high pitched roof, allowing a
gap for fresh air to flow freely into the stables, yet
at the same time protecting the animals from all but the
harshest of weather.

furnishings at all can be seen, and a damp smell
permeates the air.  The roof has holes in it letting
in the weather, and what little is left of the door
hangs on rusted hinges.  The floor is rotten, and in
place the muddy ground beneath can be seen.
