   A five-foot-wide basin raised two-feet from the floor on the four marble
legs dominates this small chamber. The basin, currently empty, sparkles with
a lustrous sheen. Impossibly, it appears that the large serpent is  made from
a single gemstone, possible emerald, cut with large facets into a bowlike
shape. The walls bear the images of of powerful, yuan-ti pure-bloods carved
into the rock with sinous lines and serpentine broad stokes. In each corner,
a huge stone idol bears the likeness of an emerald serpent.

skulls, line the walls of this massive chamber, which is apparently cut from
living stone. The light reflects from the damp walls. The high ceiling is
supported by two rows of carved pillars with demonic yuan-ti beings in the
embrace of a foul aberration. Painted carvings of a female humanoid with
witherings snakes for hair serpents entine her body in a gruesome fornication.
The painting continues northward along the walls to the south. A stone double
door exits the chamber to the north.

Before the Idol of Sseth~
   This room is shrouded in complete darkness. Nevertheless, a rounded black
walls and features of the chamber can be seen in shades of darkness. Two tall
pillars support the high, pinnacled ceiling, and three altars rest atop a rise
of single steps etched with sinous serpentine designs, the steps are rounded
so that it takes up about a third of the chamber. The pillars seem intricately
carved with tentacles, skulls, contorted yuan-ti faces, serpents, swirling suns
eclipsed by a serpents unhinged jaws, and smiling yuan-ti abominations. The two
sided altar are perfectly regular black rectangular slabs of cold stone, while
the main, grand altar is strangely misshapen, lumpy, and organic in appearance.
Behind this strange altar is a huge idol of Sseth, that pulses with an aura of
darkness. Shadows of serpents dance up and down the idol. The chamber is
extremely cold, numbing any mortal deep to the core of their soul.

The Chamber of the Shadow Serpent~
   Black drapes cover the walls of this chamber, and soft black velvet rugs
cover the floors. A metal pallet suggests that it might be used as a very
uncomfortable bed. The chamber seems vaguely X-shaped. Darkness seems to
gather menacingly in the corners of the walls, aided perhaps by the fact that
the walls do not seem to run straight for any significant distance anywhere in
the room. A noticeable chill in the air amplifies the sense of menance. The
room radiates an uncomfortable silence and an alien like darkness clings to
everything in the room.

   This wide hallway has vaulted ceiling that arch up to a height of twenty
five feet. The hallway is alit by guttering light from the many torches,
mostly made from oil-filled human skulls, they line the walls of the hallway
on make-shift scones mounted in the stone wall. The hallway echos with
hissing sounds that could be some sort of language and hundereds perhaps
even thousands of small snakes slither across the floors here.

The Chamber of Nights Embrace~
   This chamber is enshrouded in complete darkness. Nevertheless, anyone
entering the chamber can see the rounded black walls and features of the
room--as if they could see shades of darkness. Tall pillers support the
high, pinnacled ceiling. The pillars seem intricately carved with serpents
of all shapes and sizes, with bejewled eyes of various precious stones. This
dark chamber is extremely cold, a coldness that would numb any being with

The Chamber of the Eternal Eclipse~
   This huge chamber is ninety-feet wide and almost twice that long. Pillars
of black marble line each wall, rising sixty feet from floor to the ceiling.
The floors, walls, and ceiling are made of tiled black onyx. An ancient
design of a night serpent with gem studded eyes has been etched into every
tile of this chamber. The design appears to decipt the serpents coils wrapped
around a black sun, mouth opened impossible wide as if it was going to devour
it. In the center of this chamber stands a majestic statue of a serpent with
midnight blue scales. The serpent mouth opens wide ready to devour anything
within this chamber.

&+LThe &+GN&+gest&+L of the &+gE&+Gme&+Wrald Serp&+Gen&+gt&n~
   Twenrty feet square, this chamber has fine marble floors. A domed ceiling
supported by obsidian running up the walls. A dim light, a faint chiming sound,
and the smell of serpents pervade this chamber. Floating in mid-air is a single
emerald shaped into an egg. It glistens in the unnatural light, floating
approximately five feet from the floor.

The Chamber of the Death Serpent~
   This large square room is known as the Chamber of the Death Serpent,
a place devoted to the study of ancient necromancy. The walls, ceiling,
and floors of this chamber is made of black marble that shines with a
magical luster. In back of the chamber is a black obelisk-like pedestal,
that is decorated with necromantic runes of power. The obelisk-like
pedestal hums and pulses with power, that power is used to power a rift.
Hanging in mid-air is a rip in space. A tear in the fabric of reality
that leads to the negative plane. Harnessing the power of the rift is
a undead yuan-ti lich and an undead illithid lich, channeling the power
of the rift the two ancient undead wizard cast spells of ancient and
awesome power.

The Spire of the Elder Eternal Evil~
   This huge chamber is ninety-feet wide and almost twice that long. Pillars
of black marble line each wall, rising sixty feet from floor to the ceiling.
The floors, walls, and ceiling are made of tiled black onyx. An ancient
design of a night serpent with gem studded eyes has been etched into every
tile of this chamber. The design appears to decipt the serpents coils wrapped
around a black sun, mouth opened impossible wide as if it was going to devour
it. In the center of this chamber stands a majestic statue of a serpent with
midnight blue scales. The serpent mouth opens wide ready to devour anything
within this chamber.

Inside the Spire of the Death Serpent~
   The archways lead into the spires grand entry chamber, a circular room,
with a ceiling that soears three stories overhead. Four chandeliers hang
suspended from the ceiling, each of them glowing a sickly greenish-yellow,
casting a jaundiced light over evertyhing in the chamber. The floor is made
up of polished black flagstones, each roughly the same width and length.
Standing inside on either side of the gate, at the bottom of the spiral
staircase is a gigantic skeletal yuan-ti. These two monsterous skeletons
seem to guard the staircase that leads into the spires interior. Each guard
is four times the height of a human and holds a huge yuan-ti forged scimitar
shaped like a curved serpent appropriate for its immense size, its bony hands
locked around the hilt with the point of the blade on the floor. Each gigantic
skeleton is dressed in black robes, the hood of which hides its bony serpent
features from view. Large gold chains hang from its neck and waist.

   The rounded black walls of this chamber has an aura of unearthly forbording.
At first glance this majestic chamber is beautiful to behold, but after the
moment of awe stuck has passed, the feeling of ancient dread and terrors
thought forgotten is all that remains. The chamber is completely black here,
yet the size and features of the room can be seen as shades of darkness. The
walls are a mesh of fine plates, hammered into place to appear midnight blue
scales. To the far south of the chamber is a wall with a mural of a giant size
majestic serpent, with slit-pupile eyes that are sickly yellow black of rotten
eggs. The majestic serpent mouth open impossible wide reavling monsterious
fangs. The tongue of the serpent serves as the floors of the hall, stretching
off to north of the hallway.

&+LThe An&n&+wc&+Wi&n&+we&+Lnt H&n&+wa&+Wl&+Ll of &n&+mN&+Mi&n&+rg&+Rhtm&n&+ra&+Mr&n&+mes&n~
&+L   The ancient hallway of nightmares is exactly what it is, a hall plagued with
&+Lthe nightmares of mortals and even immortals. Terrifying sha&n&+wd&+Co&+Ww&+Ls screech and
&+Lscream with &n&+rma&+Rli&n&+rce &+Land dr&n&+we&+Wad&n&+wf&+Lul forms of &n&+wter&+Wro&+Lrs and &n&+rde&+Rmo&n&+rns&+L unlike anything
&+Lever seen before ripple throughout the hallway, manifested by the ancient
&+Lpower of the El&nd&+Ce&+Lr Eter&nn&+Ca&+Ll E&nv&+Ci&+Ll. Thoughts of terror becomes a reality as
&+Lterrifying monsters thought long forgotten materialize out of thin air.

The Hall of the El&n&+wd&+Ce&+Lr Eter&n&+wn&+Ca&+Ll E&n&+wv&+Ci&+Ll~
   This majestic hallway at first glance is beautiful to behold, but after
the moment of awe stuck has passed, the feeling of ancient dread and terrors
thought forgotten is all that remains. The hallway is completely black here,
yet the size and features of the room can be seen as shades of darkness. The
black walls have serpent like midnight blue scales, the unearthly hallway rises
so high it could have only been created for titans. The majestic hallway
continues on towards the north

   This titanic chamber has a slightly concave roof and floor. Cut into the
living stone of this chamber are thousands upon thousands of sinous serpent
designs covering the walls, floors, and ceiling. Directly in the center of
the chamber stands a gigantic statue of Dendar, the Night Serpent. The
majestic statue carved from glossy black living stone that gives it a
flawless glistening sheen. A master work that could have only been crafted by
the hands of some unknown goddess of beauty. The Night Serpent coils wrap
around a huge shining sphere of magical light, a perfect depiction of a bright
burning sun. The midnight scales of the Night Serpent seems to dim the bright
light of sun. The serpent mouth is open impossible wide, so wide it seems as
if it could swallow the sun whole.

Inside the Spire of the Naga Overlord~
   The stair steps have been fashioned to appear like a serpent climbing a
tree, the craftmanship is so masterfully done that the scales glistences with
the color of midnight. Also skillfully carved, the staircase railing has the
outline of wriggling snakes in a caduceus pose. The walls, floors, and ceiling
of this long hallway is a mixture of night  blue marble and black onyx as dark
the midnight sky. The walls have mosiacs with artistic patterns sewen into
them of kingdom of nagas. The staircase spirals upwards into the serpentine
spire, an archway stone carved into a serpent exits the spire to the west.

   The narrow path comes to an abrupt end in the shadow of a fairly large
set of ruins that looms up from the surrounding woodlands. At the base sits
a partial collapsed set of three-tiered stone plat-forms of what was once a
massive and probably quite impressive steps leading in the ruins. Entire
wedges of stone were carried from afar to create such a massive and impressive
structuer. The walls of the ruins loom high over head atleast forty-feet. In
the center of the wall facing the jungle is a wide double-gated foor that is
eight feet wide and twelve feet tall. The doors are at least bronze-plated,
if not solid bronze. The metal has been divided into little panels, and each
panel has a small scene done in bas-relief. Most of these scenes depict yuan-ti
warriors, but those in the top panels on each sideshow Sseth and an ancient
serpent swallowing ths sun whole.

The Chamber of Anatomy~
   The walls of this chamber are covered in parchment. Penned on each sheet
of parchment are what appears to be diagrams of human innards. Heads, torsos,
arms, and legs are portrayed in grisly detail in these drawings. The eastern
and central portion of the chamber contains low benches facing towards the
long table near the wall on the west side of the room. Hanging from a chain
above the table is a human skull emanating bright light through its vacant
eyesockets onto the table's contents; a flayed humanoid body, apparently the
objec of study in this demented chamber.
