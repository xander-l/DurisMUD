&+yCourtyard before a once proud Keep.~
The entryway to what was once a proud keep. It seems to have been abandoned and has started to fall into disrepair. Plant life has begun its work on climbing the walls and covering windows and doorways, and the elements have begun to wear down the stone and mortar construction. There is evidence of things being moved time to time but nothing that would indicate that there is a living humanoid occupant. The three large doors opening into the keep have seemed to withstand the passage of time fairly well at least.

This section of the great hall is in bad shape. The floor here has given way to age and lack of maintenance. Any movement into this room risks falling through to whatever is below.

&+YGreat hall.~
The foyer opens up into a big banquet room that extends to the north, south, east and west. This once grand room has fallen into disrepair. The air is not as stale as one might expect with small hints of a breeze now and again. Tables and chairs are still lined up with place settings as if awaiting guests for a banquet. There are large windows of thick stained glass that still allow a useable amount of light to filter in.

The plant life has begun to take over the road leading to the gate.There was once a most around the walls but it has long since dried up and been filled in with bits of stone fallen from the walls and plant growth. Ivy vines have turned the portcullis into a green wall of leaves that various small birds have taken to nesting in.

Approaching a long &+Lf&+worg&+Lott&+wen castle~
The castle is built against the mountains with the back of the castle actually being built into a sheer cliff that reaches over a thousand feet up. This allows for only 3 main walls to be built. There seems to be tunnels carved back into the cliff as well allowing for much more storage and livable space without having to expand the walls. The tops of the walls and other structures that can be seen have started to crumble making some of the area impassable and dangerous.

The top of this tower has a view of the whole south wall to the east of the gates. It can be used to direct castle defenses against attack. Looking out you can see that the walls are still standing though he crenelations along the top have tumbles down into the walkway making it mostly impassable. To the east there is a tower in the southeast corner and one to the northeast against the cliff.

There are also nice openings for defenders to shoot arrows or even drop stones or other objects down on anyone attacking the gate itself. To that end there are small piles of human head size rocks placed around the room.

West hoarding of the gate.~
The top of this tower was used to control the latching for the main gate and portcullis. The mechanisim has long since become unusable due to age and lack of maintenance. There are also nice openings for defenders to shoot arrows or even drop stones or other objects down on anyone attacking the gate itself. To that end there are small piles of human head size rocks placed around the room.

Climbing the tower stairs~
Stairs lead up to the top of the tower or down towards the gatehouse. The stairwell is in good shape and there are still a few torches along the walls that can be lit when needed.

Northwest tower of the gatehouse~
The top of this tower has a view of the whole south wall to the west of the gates. It can be used to direct castle defenses against attack. Looking out you cna see that the walls are still standing though he crenelations along the top have tumbled down into the walkway making it mostly impassable. To the west there is a tower in the southwest corner and one to the northwest against the cliff.
