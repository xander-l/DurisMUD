&+BAlong a Mysterious River~
&+b   The current sweaps along the jagged boulders that seep out of the
&+bwalls that are painted in a pallette of violets and azure. Most of these
&+brocks are very smooth to the touch with oozing moses growing in the
&+bcrevaces and maggots scuttering around frantically on the over passes and
&+bwhere earth comes up out of the spikes of huge rock.

&+bthe rocks where vast amounts of backlash coming whipping out stining

&+bwith age and are constantly bombarded with gushes of river water. Even

tunnels streaking off in different directions. Mud has made its home to
the roads, walls, ceilings and tunnels of this place. Mud of all textures
and colors sometimes even glowing. From ages ago this cave with its tunnels
was forged from the primal elements of the earth and came into existence
with little or no life. Now in this time of Bloodlust many creatures
inhabit these dwellings of the under world.

finests of silks. The walls radiate an eerily glow of jade and velvet.

with various types of the gems of these parts. Children can be seen playing,
miner's are coming back from a hard days work and the house wives scurrying
around on different errands along with their most unusual pets. The ceiling
here is barely tall enough for things to stand in, and cob webs spread
around the highest corners. The air is moist and damp with a pleasant scent
of food cookig in the air.

&+Where relax and take a break from the mines. The tile is a marble color of

and gives strangers a sense of home. Grass can be seen a little bit above
and there are many small creatures scurrying here.

that whatever is above is very nasty and brings dark dapness down the trail.
As there would normally be light on the outside, this place is very gloomy
and dark. The rocks are jagged, but it widends as you go up and it gets more
steep and treacherous as you descend. The plants grow here and the small
animals seak shelter.

&+Rpowerful continual darkness. The air is that of the damned, and a presence
&+Rof evil fills the area. Corpses glow as though there souls have not gone
&+Ron their way and cackles of insane glee can be heard all around. Howls of
&+Rpain come from all directions and blood pours out of platinum skulls on
&+Rthe deep black altar. The smell of burnt flesh is definitly noticeable along
&+Rwith the burnt dead bodies on the gallows around the altar. Severed limbs
&+Rhave been thrown down the mountain side and the rotting flesh brings swarms
&+Rof plaque brinings vermin and insects who devour in the rotted pours of the
&+Rransacked flesh.

&+WA Diamond Path~
&+w   This is the end of a beautifully forged diamond plated path that leads
up to a very percular house, that looks like a mansion of the upper world, as
if someone has gotten lost down here. The reflecting light seems to make it
illuminate with a sharp white glow and dancing images can be seen as the
beams of light are broken as people strut through them.

due to lava as it seems the rock has been melted along with the poor souls

taught the powers to summon the beings of the planes and large lumbering
hulks of fire and earth clash in here as the young students practice their
deadly skills. Sounds of disolving elementals swarm the room as spells rip
outta their masters hands. Streaks of fire and hunks of dirt fly across the
room as one after another a mental bites the dust, just as another one is
conjurered.

scrolls and creates great magical potions. Many different maps and charts
lay on the shelves that are scattered around the room. Smells of burning
insence fill the room. The master sits on a bundel of carpets and pilows
with little stands that have scrolls piled up and in the center of the room
is a small fire place where food can be cooked or the insence is burnt.

&+Lalso price lists of how much the gems will go for. Since the village is just

had failed in their duties. The rubble has dark burn marks on it as though
this is a very deadly practicing chamber. Sounds of pain can be heard about
as yet another elementals fizzles and dies. The room itself is extremely
large with the heigh of the cave ranging about ninty feet, and the width
a good one hundred feet leaving plenty of room for fireballs and lightning
bolts to be called down. There is a fiery pit in the center of the room. The
pit has a very loose pile of mud, that almost seems alive, flowing around
it.
