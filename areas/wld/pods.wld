Entering the &+GSwamp&n~
   The soft sound of rustling &+gleaves&n fills the air as small &+wanimals&n scurry
through the sparse &+gund&n&+yer&+gbrush&n at the edge of the &+gswamp&n.  The faint &+modor&n of
&+yrotting vegetation&n can be detected in the damp &+cair&n.  Though the &+gplants&n are
not growing thickly in this spot, they can be seen growing so thickly that
they almost create walls not too far away.  Occasionally a loud cry can be
heard but whether it is from an &+wanimal&n or frightened person is not clear.

&+gEntering the Swamp&n~
&+g   The &+Gundergrowth&n&+g is much thicker here, giving the &+csmall creatures&+g places&n
&+gto hide when they hear intruders approaching.  Clouds of &+minsects&+g rise from&n
&+gthe ground to harass visitors, welcome and unwelcome alike, darting around&n
&+gfaces and trying to land in eyes.  Though the vegetation blocks the way to&n
&+gthe north, pathways lead both east and west. The sound of splashing nearby&n
&+gis enough to warn the wary that standing &+bwater&+g and the &+ccreatures&+g that live&n
&+gin it, is close.&n

&+gIn the Swamp&n~
&+g   Tracks of &+canimals&+g, large and small, cross the path as it winds deeper into&n
&+gthe thick vegetation.  Rustling in the underbrush makes it clear that life is&n
&+gabundant and active in the area.  An occasional loud cry can be heard despite&n
&+gthe muffling quality of the lush vegetation.  Thick strands of &+wgray moss&+g hang&n
&+gfrom the trees, making it hard to see very far away.  The ground has become a&n

A Bit Drier Ground on the Trail~
   The trail rises up slightly and the ground becomes drier. There are fewer
&+minsects&n in the area to annoy travelers as they try to find their way through
the tangle of &+gtrees&n and underbrush in the &+gswamp.&n  The trees are not as thick
which eases the sense of claustrophobia, but there is still the feeling that
unfriendly eyes are watching.  The prints on the ground show that large &+ycats&n
are in the area, seeking prey.

   The trail runs into vegetation so thick that it cannot be passed.  Another
way must be found to move deeper into the &+gswamp. &+GVines&n entangled in the trees
form a solid wall on all sides but the south. &+cSmall creatures&n climb the &+Gvines&n
to scurry around in safety, out of sight of all &+mpredators&n as they dart around
in their eternal search for food.  In a small &+gshelter&n cleverly woven into the

   The footing is more secure as the ground rises slightly, becoming drier.
It holds prints much better, showing that the trail is used by &+ccreatures&n of
many different shapes and sizes.  Upon close inspection, part of a person's
footprint can be seen among the many prints.  It seems to lead further into
the swamp, heading north.   Though the air is filled with insect song, very
few of the &+mcreatures&n fly around living things to harass them.

   The trail splits, going both north and west.  Both ways seem to be equally
safe...or equally dangerous.  Thick &+gvegetation&n surrounds the trail, with &+wgray&n
&+wvines&n hanging down to entangle the unwary.  Both paths appear to be as dry as
this area, with very few &+mflying insects&n to annoy the traveler.  Small &+canimals&n
dart across the trail moving from one safe place in the underbrush to another
as they hunt for food.  Beyond the barrier formed by the &+gvegetation&n along the
east, faint splashing and animal cries of fear are heard as a large &+mpredator&n
hunts deeper in the &+gswamp.&n

&+g   The ground is even wetter with the trail winding between small pools of&n
&+Gscum-covered &+Bwater.&n&+g  The ground makes sucking sounds as it is reluctant to&n
&+grelease the feet of those that walk on it.  Clouds of &+minsects&+g swarm around&n
&+gvisitors to the swamp, seeking unprotected &+Mflesh&n&+g to feast upon.  Bugs with&n
&+mst&+Mran&n&+mge p&+Mink ca&n&+mra&+Mpa&n&+mces&+g skate across the surface of the water, disappearing&n
&+gbeneath the surface with small popping sounds.&n

&+gA Trail in a Swamp&n~
&+g   The trail winds on through the thick vegetation, and the &+wgray moss&+g that&n
&+gdrapes from the trees becomes even thicker, obscuring the area surrounding&n
&+gthe trail.  The pools of &+Gscum-covered &+Bwater&n&+g grow larger, making it hard to&n
&+gstay even relatively dry.  Splashing sounds and loud calls come from every&n
&+gside, but the ones making the sounds cannot be seen as the &+wmoss&+g hides them&n
&+gfrom view.  Clouds of &+minsects&+g fill the air, harassing travelers who are in&n
&+gtheir area.&n

&+gA Turn in the Trail&n~
&+g   The pools of &+Gscum-covered &+Bwater&n&+g grow larger, forcing those using the trail&n
&+gto walk through them more often, and travelers become coated with &+Gslimy green&n
&+Gooze.&n&+g  While the &+Gooze&n&+g reeks with the smell of rotting vegetation, it seems to&n
&+gkeep the clouds of &+minsects&+g at bay, as they refuse to land on the sticky &+Gooze.&n
&+gThere are &+ybirds&+g in the area, but they are larger, and their plumage is either&n
&+bblack &+gor &+ybrown&+g and their calls are fierce, not at all like songs.  &+yDebris&+g has&n
&+gbeen stacked in piles at different spots in the pools and some larger &+canimals&n
&+gcan be seen going in and out of them.&n

A Trail in a &+gSwamp&n~
   The trail rises, becoming dry.  Though &+minsects&n still fly in clouds, they
are small clouds that are easily ignored.  There are fewer small &+canimals&n in
the area which makes the hunting calls of large &+canimals&n even easier to hear
as there is no rustling to distract the ear. Very few &+Rbi&+Grd&+Bs&n fly in the area
as there are not many &+minsects&n to catch and eat, and apparently none of them
have &+ynested&n in the &+wgray moss&n hanging down from the trees.

that this is still in the depths of a swamp.  &+wThick gray moss&n hangs down from

&+BA Water-filled Area on a Trail in a &n&+gSwamp&n~
&+B   The &n&+gvegetatation&+B suddenly thins as the trail goes into an area completely&n
&+Bcovered by water.  An occasional strange, twisted &n&+gtree&+B grows from the water,&n
&+Band &n&+yroots&+B belonging to these &n&+gtrees&+B poke above the surface in odd spots. &+GScum&n
&+Bfloats in clumps in spots, giving &n&+ccreatures&+B that live in the water places to&n
&+Bhide as they watch for any movement in their area.  Clouds of &n&+minsects&+B fly up&n
&+Bfrom the &+Gscum&+B to attack any exposed &+Mflesh&+B to feast on it.  Large, dark &n&+bbirds&n
&+Bperch on the branches of the twisted &n&+gtrees,&+B watching all travelers with what&n
&+Bappears to be intelligence.  &n&+wThick gray &+gvines&+B grow among the &n&+wthick gray moss&n
&+Bthat hangs down from the &n&+gtrees,&+B camouflaging a crumbling &n&+wstone wall&+B which is&n
&+Bthe same color as the &n&+wmoss.&n

A Bend in the Trail in the &+gSwamp&n~
   The trail takes a sharp turn, heading deeper into the &+gswamp.  &+wThick gray&n
&+wmoss&n hangs down from the &+gtrees,&n and small &+ccreatures&n scurry up and down the
&+wmoss&n as they search for food while trying not to become food for &+mpredators.&n
&+wSmall birds&n dart through the area, searching for a meal, and they chase the
small &+ccreatures&n when they see them.  Loud calls sound through the &+gswamp,&n as
large &+mpredators&n seek and find food.

A Trail in a &+gSwamp&n~
   The trail runs straight through the thick &+gvegetation&n for a welcome change.
&+wThick gray moss&n hangs from the trees, making it seem almost like a &+ytunnel&n not
a trail.   Small &+ccreatures&n scurry up and down the &+wmoss&n as they go about their
daily task of living.   Loud crashing nearby reveals the presence of at least
one large &+canimal,&n but whether it is friend or foe remains to be seen.

A Bend in a Trail in a &+gSwamp&n~
   The trail bends, twisting between stands of thick &+gvegetation.&n  The &+wthick&n
&+wgray moss&n that hangs from &+gtrees&n brushes anything that passes by, entangling
it and making progress slow.  Small &+ccreatures&n in this &+wmoss&n scurry away from
anything larger than they are, and &+wsmall birds&n dart down upon the &+ccreatures&n
when they expose themselves.

around on itself. &+wThick gray moss&n hangs down from the &+gtrees,&n entangling all

to the west.  The ground is drier but the air is still highly humid.  &+BWater&n
drops drip from the &+Gleaves&n of the thick &+gvegetation&n as moisture condenses on
them.  There are a few &+minsects&n to harass travelers and a few &+Ybi&+Rr&+Bd&+Ys&n dart out

of sight in the thick &+gvegetation&n pretty fast.  The &+Gswamp&n has a more sinister
air here, and some of the &+gplants&n lean toward anything that goes by, reaching
out long leaves to try to entangle anything that moves close to them.  &+yBirds&n
flit among the trees, avoiding the &+gplants&n that attack them.  &+wThick gray moss&n

food for others.  Clouds of &+minsects&n still fill the air despite the dryness.
A few &+Yco&+Rl&+Borf&+Gu&+Yl bi&+Rrds&n fly from their &+ynests&n in the &+wmoss&n to catch some &minsects&n

drier.  More &+Gba&+gm&+Gboo&n grows here than the huge &+gtrees,&n and the tiny &+gg&+Gr&+geen b&+Gi&+grds&n
that flit among the &+Gba&+gm&+Gboo s&+gta&+Glks&n go from &+Mf&+mlo&+Yw&+mer&n to &+Mf&+mlo&+Yw&+mer&n up in the tops of
the &+Gba&+gm&+Gboo.&n  Large &+ra&+yn&+rts&n carrying unidentified bits of stuff march on a trail
of their own, and all the other &+ccreatures&n just avoid them.  &+YB&+Ri&+Yrds&n with &+ynests&n
in the &+wthick gray moss&n that drapes from the &+gtrees&n dart out to chase away any
&+minsects&n that come into the area. The air is filled with the continuous noise
from the &+ccreatures&n that live in the &+gswamp.&n

&+gA Short Straight Stretch in a Trail in a Swamp&n~
&+g   The trail runs on a straigh north-south path for a short way, going through&n
&+ga leafy tunnel created by the thick vegetation.  The &+Gba&+gm&+Gboo&+g thins out as large&n
&+gtrees become more plentiful in the wetter ground.  Small &+Bpools of water&+g can be&n
&+gspotted amid the underbrush, the perfect place for annoying &+minsects&+g to stay to&n
&+grest between bouts of attacking people.  &+MD&+me&+Yl&+micate &+Mf&+mlo&+Yw&+mers&+g grow near the tops of&n

A Trail in a Swamp~

&+Gba&+gm&+Gboo&n has edged out the big trees and &+Md&+me&+Yl&+mica&+Mt&+me &+Mf&+mlo&+Yw&+mers&n growing high upon the
&+Gba&+gm&+Gboo &+gs&+Gta&+glks&n have &+gti&+Gn&+gy b&+Gi&+grds&n flying between them.  A few &+rb&+Wu&+Ct&+Gt&+ger&+mfl&+Mies&n flutter
through, but with no standing water in the area, there are few other &+minsects.&n
The quality of the rustling sound is different as the types of &+gplants&n growing
around the bases of the &+Gba&+gm&+Gboo&n is different, with different creatures nesting&n
around them.

A Straight Section on a Trail in a &+gSwamp&n~
   This area, and the area to the north, is relatively dry, while to the south
the trail dips back down into a much wetter area.  The &+Gtrees&n grow a little bit
further apart, and the trail runs straight for a short way.  Though &+wmoss&n still
hangs from the &+Gtrees,&n it is thin, not able to support very much weight at all.
As a result of the thinner &+wmoss, &+Ysun&+Wl&+Yight&n reaches down into this area, and the
&+gvines&n that are suppressed by the &+wmoss&n climb the tree trunks instead.

&+gA Dead-End on a Trail in a Swamp&n~
&+g   The trees close in, allowing no further progress.  The only way out is the&n
&+gway in.  &+wThick moss&+g drapes down from the trees, entangling the limbs of those&n
&+gwho enter the area.  Small &+ccreatures&+g scurry about in the &+wmoss,&+g climbing up it&n
&+gto reach the &+Yfruit&+g growing in the treetops.  &+GScum-covered &+Bpools&+g are hidden in&n
&+gthe underbrush, but the &+minsects&+g have no trouble finding them to rest on.  The&n
&+gunwary stumble into the &+Bpools&+g to become covered with a &+Gslimy green goo&+g and to&n
&+gdisturb the &+minsects,&+g who swarm up in clouds to harass them.&n

A Turn in a Trail in a &+gSwamp&n~
   The trail turns to the east as the &+Glea&+gf&+Gy tu&+gnn&+Gel&n to the north does not grow
this far.  The moss and &+Gvines&n do not combine to make a long tunnel, but cling
to individual &+gtrees&n instead.  There are more sounds in this area as the &+Gvines&n
don't bind the &+wmoss&n into a sound-absorbing wall.  Squeaks can be heard as the
small &+ccreatures&n climb the moss to get to the &+Yfruit&n in the &+gtreetops.&n  When the
&+Gsn&+ra&+gkes&n that wait for them catch them, their squeals of terror can be heard as
well.  Odd booming hoots as well as snarled hunting calls fill the &+Cair&n as the
danger of the &+gswamp&n is once again reinforced for any who travel in it.

   To the west the trail continues in the dry part of the &+gswamp&n while to the
east it slopes upward onto the foot of a &+yhill.  &+GBa&+gm&+Gboo s&+gta&+Gl&+gks&n grow among the
huge &+gtrees,&n edging them out as the trail goes eastward, growing drier.  Tiny
&+gb&+Gi&+grds&n flit among the &+Mf&+mlo&+Yw&+mers&n in the tops of the &+Gba&+gm&+Gboo s&+gta&+Gl&+gks,&n attempting to
avoid the fatal embrace of &+Gsn&+ya&+gkes&n as they sip nectar from the &+Mf&+mlo&+Yw&+mers.&n  Some
&+wrats&n with wings fly about, seeking &+minsects&n as well as &+Yfruit&n among the &+gplants&n
even as they try not to become food themselves.

Huge &+gtrees&n grow tall, reaching high into the &+Csky,&n with &+wmoss&+g draping down them

&+gInside the &+wR&+Wui&+wns&n~
&+g   There were once houses to the west, but they have been reduced to rubble&n
&+gthat blocks all access in that direction.  Grass and flowers grow on top of&n
&+gthe destroyed houses, softening the sense of destruction in the area.  Some&n
&+ggraceful trees grow in the area seeming to talk with each other as a gentle&n
&+gbreeze causes their leaves to make whispering sounds.  Despite the fact the&n
&+gtown has been completely destroyed, there is a sense of peace here, and the&n

   The trail continues through drier ground north, south, and west.  &+GBa&+gm&+Gboo&n
and huge &+gtrees&n grow intermixed, creating an area where breezes flow freely.
&+GThorny vines&n are rampant in the area, growing between plants to create some
&+gsw&+Ga&+gying b&+Gr&+gidges&n that small &+ccreatures&n can use with care.  &+MF&+mlo&+Yw&+mers&n grow among
the the plants, their bright colors catching the eye of all who pass.  Bats
fly among the &+Mf&+mlo&+Yw&+mers,&n searching for &+minsects&n or nectar to eat.

A Bend in a Trail in a &+gSwamp&n~
   The trail continues through drier ground both east and south.  A few stalks
of &+Gba&+gm&+Gboo&n grow among the huge &+gtrees. &+GThorny vines&n grow on the bamboo, reaching
out in spots to make &+gb&+Gr&+gid&+Gg&+ges&n over to the &+gtrees. &+wMoss&n hangs down from the &+gtrees&n
and &+ccreatures&n use it to climb up into the &+gtreetops,&n searching for &+Yfruit&n to eat
up there. Loud crashing can be heard as something large forces its way through
the &+gunderbrush.&n

A Bend in a Trail in a &+gSwamp&n~
   The trail continues through drier ground both west and south.  A few &+Gst&+ga&+Glks&n
of &+Gba&+gm&+Gboo&n struggle to live amid the huge &+gtrees,&n but the &+gtrees&n are blocking off
the &+Ysun&+Ws&+Yhine&n that the &+Gst&+ga&+Glks&n need to grow.  &+wMoss&n hangs down from the &+gtrees&n and
small &+ccreatures&n use it to climb up into the &+gtreetops&n to look for &+Yfruit&n growing
there.  Because of the &+gtrees&n the &+Ysu&+Wn&+Ylight&n is muted, breaking through the cover
of the &+gtreetops&n only in a few spots.

A Winding Trail in a &+gSwamp&n~
   The trail continues through drier ground to the north, but to the east it
dips down into &+gsoggier&n ground.  &+wMoss&n drapes down from the huge &+gtrees,&n making
it so that the &+Ysun&+Wb&+Yeams&n break through only in spots.  Tiny &+Ypar&+Wt&+Yic&+Wl&+Yes&n seem to
dance in the bright &+Ysun&+Wb&+Yeams.&n  Loud calls come from all over as &+ccreatures&n of
the &+gswamp&n go about the business of trying to find food without becoming food
themselves.
