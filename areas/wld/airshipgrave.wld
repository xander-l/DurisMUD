&+yA Winding, &+wRocky&+y, Mountain Trail&n~
&+y   One finds themself on a treacherous trail winding through the rugged
&+ymountain range. Even though it used heavily, it is nontheless dangerous,
&+yas pitfalls and avalanches are a common occurrence along the trail, and one
&+yis always advised to use caution. The shrill shriek of a distant harpy can
&+ybe heard every so often, but other than that, there is naught but silence,
&+yexcept the occasional tumbling stone.

&+yA Brief Side Trail&n~
&+y   Just off the central trail is this side path that leads to what are
&+yobviously a series of carved rock steps that lead upwards to a small
&+ymountain overhang, though it is near impossible to see what lies upwards
&+yfrom here. The random bray of a nearby mountain goat can be startling as
&+yone gazes upwards to the massive mountain peaks, and the feeling of in-
&+ytimidation hangs heavy as one can feel themself in a land that seems age-
&+yless, ancient, and once extremely powerful.

&+y    Between the twin peaks of two monstrous mountains stands a pair of
&+ysheer &+Ygold&+y gates that reach nearly as high into the clouds as the moun-
&+ytains themselves. It is a perplexing sight, seeing these perfectly crafted
&+yand rune covered gates in the middle of nearly nowhere, this stark trail
&+ythrough the mountains, yet proof of some highly intelligent and gifted
&+yrace is obvious now, though who or what lies behinds these gates remains
&+ya mystery as they are tightly sealed. The stone steps lead back down to
&+ythe side trail.&n

&+ybelieve to be lesser, which is basically all. This golden spire climbs up
&+ywards high into the clouds, second in hieght only to the&+Y capital spire&+y,
&+yas a display of strength and might.&n

&+Lwhat type of hideous creatures lie outside the gates of &+YDawndale&+L. The

&+Lsolid, foot-thick glass, which allows the &+Ymuseum&+L visitors to look inside

&+yThe &+YGolden Gates&+y of the &+YCapital Spire&n~
&+y   Standing at the base of the &+Ycapital spire&+y one cannot help and drop a
&+yjaw in awe and amazement. As the foundation begins here, solidly built
&+ybetween the mountain peaks, it quickly ascends high above the summits, so
&+yfar that it is impossible to see the top, where the great &+Clense&+y is kept,
&+yabove the cloudscape so it can send rays of sunlight across &+YDawndale
&+ycontinously. The gates here leading into the capital are nearly as impres-
&+ysive as those at the city entrance, large, intricate, and all carved from
&+ygold. Standing here can certainly make one feel very small and insignifi-
&+ycant, very quickly. A much smaller carved door leads into the mountain-
&+yside to the north.

&+yThe Foyer of the &+YCapital Spire&n~
&+y   As a race which is somewhat reknowned for their reclusiveness, the &+YHigh-
&+YElves&+y go to great effort build their structures in fashions that could
&+ydazzles kingdoms and become wonders of the world, yet of course, the loca-
&+ytions of their buildings are so remote, they are rarely ever seen by anyone
&+yother than the &+YHigh-Elven&+y kin themselves, which is exactly how they like it.
&+yThe great spire is one of those creations which could rival the greatest
&+yfeats of construction and sorcery on the planet, comparable to the great
&+WTharnadian&+L Keep&+y, the legendary, mystical &+BTransparent Towers&+y, and elegant
&+gPalace&+y of &+GJade&+y. A spiral staircase leads downwards into the mountain rock,
&+ywhile open-arched doorways lie north, south, and east.

&+ylocations. It is a large collection of elven art, ancient texts, various
&+ymemorbilia, and most shockingly - a living display of some of the darker
&+yraces of elfkin. The &+YHigh-Elves&+y keep their displays behind thick layers of
&+yglass that encircle the hallway to the east. It is truely a sight to see,
&+ythough oppinions on the displays living conditions differ greatly. A large
&+ydoor leading to the central hallway is usually kept wide open for the many
&+yvisitors.

&+y   Despite the sheen from the golden statues lining the center of the hall-
&+yway here, the fact that a multitude of angry, imprisoned, elven half-races
&+ylie just beyond a glass window, albiet thick, along the walls, is enough to
&+yunnerve any newcomer to this museum. The &+YHigh-Elves&+y believe these races here
&+yto be nothing more than examples of hideousness to be displayed for the de-
&+ylight and entertainment of their kinsmen, however, the &+mdriders&+y, &+bnaga&+y, and
&+yeven &+Mdrow&+y, seem all to eager to escape from their prison of entertainment
&+yand teach the&+Y High-Elves&+y who is the better being in a glorified and gory
&+ypayback if they were given the chance.

&+Lthe&+Y High-Elves&+L deem so unfit of society they are nothing more than living
&+Ldisplays. Of course the majority of these "displays" are actually elfkind
&+Llike the &+bnaga&+L and&+m drider&+L, which the &+YHigh-Elves&+L enjoy to show their young
&+Lwhat type of hideous creatures lie outside the gates of &+YDawndale&+L. The
&+yhabitat&+L circles around of the &+Ymuseum&+L hallway, with both sides lined with
&+Lsolid, foot-thick glass, which allows the &+Ymuseum&+L visitors to look inside
&+Lthe &+yhabitat&+L. Guards constantly enter this area and check that none of the
&+L"displays" have fashioned any sort of weapon or item that could be used
&+Lto mastermind a escape.

&+y   A typical harpy nest, like any other found high atop mountain ranges
&+yacross the warmer climates across the globe, the nest is wide open to the
&+ythin, fresh, air and really is nothing more than a circular area and floor
&+ylined with the sparse mountain vetegation. As the harpy society spends most
&+yof their time flying through the skies, they usually only use these nests
&+yfor sleeping. The larger the family, the larger the nest. The local harpy
&+ycourier has made a nest here, and spends her time resting while not deliv-

&+yA Large Harpy Nest&n~
&+y   It is rare for a male harpy to ever achieve chieftan status within a
&+ytribe or flock, rarer still to find one fairly young, however this nest,
&+ybuilt within the mountain passage is home to a young and male harpy, who
&+yhas earned his flock's admiration over just a few short years. As the
&+ylocal leader, the nest is much larger than all the other, and of course
&+yit is also built upon the highest peak, as a symbol of leadership. Sadly,
&+yfor visitors, Keenfeather is rarely at his nest, as he spends much of his
&+ytime hunting and gathering for his flock.

&+ytrue glory of&+Y Dawndale&+y. High above the clouds this scientific masterpiece
&+yhas been constructed, a giant, circular mirror that captures the light of
&+ythe sun during and reflects it throughout the entirity of the city below,
&+ymoving automatically with magic and mechanics to stay within parallel with
&+ythe sun. &+WMoon&+w-Elf&+y labourers are constantly here washing and polishing the
&+Clense&+y, while the &+Clense&+y-crafter arrives every once in awhile to make sure
&+yeverything is working smoothly.

&+yThe &+YGolden&+y Cliffs&n~
&+y   As the great reflective &+Clense&+y of &+YDawndale&+y's capital spire shines overhead,
&+Ysunlight&+y shines over these cliffs, no matter what time of day it is. Always
&+yin a state of day, never darkened, is what names this mountainside, even
&+ythough the state has been designed and constructed by high-elven magiks. The
&+YHigh-Elves&+y founded this location as their city thousands of years ago, not
&+yjust as a remote location to keep away outsiders, but because of the fact
&+ythe mountain peak upon what the great spire has been built on reaches so far
&+ytowards the heavens, it not only became a holy location, but that of the
&+ystrong &+YHigh-Elf&+y sciences, where the great&+C lense&+y could be built, enabling the
&+Ysunlight&+y of the dawn at all times. Glistening &+Ygold&+y doors lead south to the
&+ymilitary spire.&n

&+yThe &+YMilitary Spire&n~
&+y   The military spire is where the soldiers of &+YDawndale&+y live and train.
&+yThough their military force is quite small, they are made up of fiercely
&+yloyal, stern, and arrogant elves, who take the honour of military service
&+yextremely seriously. Most of the soldiers and officers that can be found
&+yhere in the spire do not tolerate any sort of intrusion from any race they
&+ybelieve to be lesser, which is basically all. This golden spire climbs up
&+ywards high into the clouds, second in hieght only to the&+Y capital spire&+y,
&+yas a display of strength and might.&n

&+yThe Pinnacle of the &+YEducational Spire&n~
&+y   The pinnacle of the educational spire is where the headmasters and mas-
&+yter professors work, sometimes teaching the younger scholars, but mostly
&+ystudying themselves in a never-ending quest for knowledge. The domed room
&+yis lined with bookshelves and filled to capacity with desks and comfortable
&+yhardwood chairs. A few small candles sit on the desks, but seem to be rare-
&+yly used as the enternal dawn of the reflective &+Clense&+y shines in through the
&+ylarge open archways at the tip of the room.

&+wElf&+y labourers. Compared to the great gold spires that make up most of the
&+ycity, this place is nothing but a hovel, albeit spacious. Most the &+WMoon-
&+wElves&+y sleep on straw beds on hard rocky floors, and cooking and lavatory
&+yareas are nonexistent. Working for the &+YHigh-Elves&+y appears to be only
&+yslightly above slavery, and the benefits are sparse. A makeshift wooden
&+ydoor leads back out to the rest of the city to the west.

&+ythe cliffside that serves as the smith shop of &+YDawndale&+y.  A roaring furn-
&+yace has been built into the back wall, with a well designed chimney that
&+ywinds its way through the mountain rock until most the smoke disperses
&+ywithout a trace to avoid notice. The local &+YHigh-Elf&+y smith specializes in
&+ycreated and forging weapons and armor that are light and strong and ex-
&+ytremely potent.

&+y    A small alcove built into the north side of the &+Ycapital spire&+y, behind
&+ythe &+Ychancellor&+y's office houses the local elfgate of &+YDawndale&+y. The room is
&+ysmall and barren except for the large shimmering portal placed at the back
&+yof the room. Centuries ago, every elven city had numerous elfgates that all
&+yled to different locations around the world, however most have become ob-
&+ysolete, and very few remain. This one is a prize of the &+YHigh-Elves&+y and is
&+ya heavily guarded treasure. Without knowledge on the gate there really is
&+yno way of knowing where it leads, except for actually entering it.

&+yThough their military force is quite small, they are made up of fiercely
&+yloyal, stern, and arrogant elves, who take the honour of military service
&+yextremely seriously. Most of the soldiers and officers that can be found
&+yhere in the spire do not tolerate any sort of intrusion from any race they
&+ybelieve to be lesser, which is basically all. This golden spire climbs up
&+ywards high into the clouds, second in hieght only to the&+Y capital spire&+y,
&+yas a display of strength and might.&n

&+yelves of &+YDawndale&+y have not been involved in any sort of war for over a
&+ythousand years so discussing battle strategies appears somewhat silly and
&+ypointless to one not accustomed to &+YHigh-Elf&+y tradition.

&+yand other dangers common throughout the mountain range. The trail itself
&+yleads downhill, sloping along the eastern cliff face, sometimes at extreme-
&+yly steep and treacherous angles.

&+yA Barren Plateau&n~
&+y   A broad area spreads out here from the mountain cliffside, a fairly flat
&+yand sparse plateau that overhangs much of the eastern face.  Nothing really
&+ygrows except for a few tiny plants due to the entire area being strong moun-
&+ytain rock. The odd mountain animal casually wanders the plateau and every
&+yonce and a while one can see a great falcon or hawk plunge from the sky
&+yabove to snatch some small marmot or mouse that has been foolish enough to
&+yscamper across the clearing, into the open. The trail back up the mountain
&+yis west.

&+yA Steep Downward Trail&n~
&+y   The trail leads down and around the plateau above, dangerously close to
&+ythe eastern cliff face that would send anyone plummeting to their death
&+yin a fraction of a second. Near the base of this secondary trail lies yet
&+yanother plateau, a clearing within the jagged mountain peaks. This can be
&+ya difficult hike for anybody if one isn't careful and watching their feet.

&+yA Broad Encarpment&n~
&+y   A second plateau opens up here, much lower to the base of the mountains
&+ythan the first. It is fairly flat, a relief compared to the treacherous
&+ytrails that leads back up. There is no way to travel further down this side
&+yof the mountain however, as beyond this clearing is nothing but a steep
&+ydrop that would surely lead to one's death. The firbolgs that seem to have
&+yinvaded this area of the mountain range must have climbed straight up the
&+ycliff face, an impressive feat which displays their motivation and sheer
&+ydetermination.

&+yA Narrow Precipice&n~
&+y   The trail leads to a ledge here, a narrow overhang that juts out over
&+ythe mountainside. An obvious deadend, there is nowhere left to go in this
&+ydirection other than straight down to a fatal fall. Rocks tumble downwards
&+ythe crag face as one walks here, and for those wishing to admire the view
&+ya simple -yet careful- look down is enough to take one's breath away.
