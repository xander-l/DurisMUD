A Winding &+yDusty Road~
   This is a long narrow winding road running through a vast grassland with no
end. The road is lightly compacted cobblestone with weeds and ferns on either
side. Dirt is sent in the air when the wind picks up and its best to have
facial cover. Some strange force seems to curl up and devour positive thinking
while walking on this road, which is probably why it's been avoided by all
those who do not belong. Animals seem to avoid this region also. There are
smoke clouds coming from the north. This road must lead to some sort of
encampment. Swords clashing is bearly audible. It is said that the minotaurs
of nearbye lands have come together with an evil band at work in these parts
and that they work together to conquer something awesome. Evil is at work here.

Before a &+yWooden Gate~
   A gate forbids entry to the encampment ahead to the unwelcomed. A large
wooden fence runs eastward or westward surrounding the camp. Spears are
visible from above the gate and as they move back and forth. The guards on
the opposite side of the gate are sentries and undoubtly minotaur. The
guards do not, however, have to do much work because the gate they protect
looks to have been construed using magic. The seal that locks the two gates
into one hums with certainty, waiting. Whatever is on the other side of this
gate must be of some importance to have all of this security, if only there
was some way to unlock this door, a key perhaps, maybe a magical spell.
Perhaps only the &+Wch&nos&+Wen&n have permission to enter. One thing is for certain,
the encampment is huge. The wind sends dirt flying into the air.

&+LA Guard Station~
   These guards are prepared to meet any intruder. Not only do they have a
large array of weapons, but their army seems second to none. This station
was constructed using ordinary wood, but it would seem that magic played a
large part as well.  A small roof on top of this station is covered with
leaves and grass to keep out the elements. A rack of tools, weapons, and
armor covers the west wall, an unseemingly large amount of weight for that
wall to uphold. It is sentries of the gate that call upon these guards incase
of an attack. They are ready in a moments notice to cut down any intruder.
They are a warrior brigade band that have been through many campaigns. The
battlescars on their body are testimony to their victories. A small trickle
of water drips into a pan, making an annoying noise.

A &+yDusty Road~
   The road is really dusty and runs through the plains to the north east to
a bit. When the wind picks up it is very difficult to see with any type of
certainty simply because sand and other loose plant life find their way into
one's eyes. The large wooden tower to the north is a scout tower undoubtably,
and it's possible to see even the remotest traveler from that vantage point.
Weeds on either side of the road have lived a long life of constantly being
trampled upon. The sounds of war can be heard as steel rings against steel.
There must be a large amount of troops stationed here. A large domed building
must be the central part of the encampment of evil. It must shelter the troops
of this evil campaign. It is rumored among the nomads of the land that there
is a war being fought here and that it has awakened a great evil.

&+LA T&nempl&+Le Entrance~
   It has been years since anyone has entered through these vine covered doors.
Years have gone by without any end. This temple is abandoned, however, the forest
life knows nothing time and continues to grow. The temple looks to have been
built using stone, henceforth it would take many centuries for it to succumb to
the withering of time. A large wooden door is the only visible entrance to the
temple. There is a small stone statue sitting at the entrance to the temple. It
is covered in many vines and debris. It is statue of the great forger of the
known world. His name was lost to most people, but some remember him as Dulg.
Perhaps this is a temple dedicated this this lost forger, perhaps inspecting
the temple further will reveal many things kept hidden to the outside world.

plant life seem to have taken this lobby in a hostile take over. There
are no decorative items in this lobby, maybe there was once, but bandits and
travelers can't be kept out of a place with no one guarding it. The lobby
expands to the south and north. This lobby must have greeted a great many
guests because it is extremely large and there are many stone benches and
fallen wooden tables. There are snakeskins here and there, large ones.
Anacondas are said to grow large enough to swallow a cow hole, maybe there
is one here. Spiders lurk in forgotten places like this, large ones.

accosted and allowed to worship. It has been many years since a guest was
greeted within these halls and the snakes of the forest seemed to have
noticed. Nothing resembling anything pleasent resides in this room, only
various nests and old snake skins that have peeled off their hosts. There must
have been a great place of worship here. Fallen statues and broken ornaments
once paid tribute to their gods. Rugs are covered in all sort of debris and

Before a &+yTower~
   The dirt is tightly packed. Numerous amounts of soldiers having walked
upon it seems to have given it a hard as rock feel. An encampment is visible
to the northeast, with several large tents. There are no fortifications
aside from the large scout tower to the west. It appears whomever built this
encampment felt safe from the outside world or any possible threat it could
present. It is rumored among the nomads of the plains to the south that a
great evil has been living here for sometime. The nomads of the plains feel
as if that evil has been awakened now. An evil so terrible that it had been
locked away by the gods for many centuries. The tribal chief of one of the
clans has such a great fear of this evil that he now is calling upon a
unified nomad nation for fear of survival against the uncoming onslaught of
the evil demon horde that he fears must have been awakened. The tower rises
a hundred feet into the air with a sentry on top.

&+LThe Conveyor Room~
   This is where, by magical means, the scout tower guards coordinate with
southern gate and beyond. There is no doubt by the number of devises here,
that the encampment would be ready for any unexpected encounter with a foe.
A table centered around the room has charts and graphs sprawled about it
loosely. An armory is to the north it seems, for a sign reads &n'&+Lfo&+rr&+Wg&+re&n'. The
smithies here could craft anything they want thanks to the orcish wizards.
A brilliant longsword made of adamantium isn't an uncommon in this army.
Indestructable breastplates are standard equipment for the minotaur warlords
and orcish highlords as well. The master forgers have endowed the power of
the most talented wizards ever into their work. Such things have never been
done in with an army. This army could be described as the ultimate.

&+LBefore a Sp&+ci&+Cr&+ca&+Ll &+LSt&+ya&+Yirc&+ya&+Lse~
   This is the base of the scout tower. A spiraling staircase runs upwards to
where the actual sentries of the tower are located. There are two watches,
morning and night. During the switching of the shifts there is a small
window of negligence in duties, to prevent a slip up, these guys are placed in
special boots, magical boots the prevent them from moving from their location
up in the tower until their replacement arrives. If a sighting were to occur,
they would use a magical device to coordinate that position to the central
cooridination center to the east. The orcs have designated only the most alert
of their kin to this duty because it is the most important. Failing to site
an approaching army and alerting the camp could result be a disaster.

   Shelves and shelves of armor and weapons are shelved here. Nothing but the
finest of the finest of armor and weaponry have been crafted. There are a few
dents visible in some armor and chips in some of the swords. Most of the
swords look to have been used extensively. The forge is a closed in shop
with only on visible exit to the south. If ever an enemy would appear on
the horizon, this would be the first spot the soldiers in the region would
fall upon. It isn't tactically sound to have a forge so close to the gates, but
the minotaur warlords are confident in the abilities of their troop to defend
themselves as well as the camp. Only the strongest of the orcish horde and
minotaur are here. It is has been described as an indestructible army.

   This staircase runs upwards toward the top of the tower, and down toward
the base of the tower. Since there is but one sentry at a time in the watch
tower, the staircase is very narrow.  This staircase spirals upwards for some
ways until it reaches the top. A drop from the top of the staircase is fatal.
A small pocket of air pushes up, since it is less warmer in the tower top up
there. Soldiers' stories often echo through this staircase, giving the scout a
top something to keep his mind occupied to fight his boredom. These scouts
are given food three times during their shift, which fights off the weariness
and sleepiness. The orcs take great pride in their alertness and ability to
coordinate with eachother, unlike the minotaurs who are unruly.

   Railings prevent unwanted accidents like falling from the top of the tower
to the ground below. Such an occurrence had happened earliar, which created
the necessity of sentries up on this tower to wear special boots that do not
allow them to move. The tower allows one to easily see the country side in
all directions, however, a thick forest to the east doesn't give the slightest
clue what it beholds. To the north, a large tower is visible, which is not
apart of the camp. The minotaur warlords have sent scouts that have never
returned from the tower. It is said that this tower has wards that protect
it at all times. It must be a magical tower lost to the magi of the world.

can see. There is some smoke rising to the south and to the east. These are
probably battlefield sites. The halflings and barbarians have been fighting
against the orcish horde and minotaur warlords. They have been battleling for
some time now with not much progress made on either side. They both have lost
equal numbers but the orcish horde outnumber the halflings almost two to one,
this combined with the added strength of the minotaur almost makes the
prospects of victory for the goodie races nill. If it weren't for barbarians
who've joined forces with the halflings there would be no chance. The smell
of burning flesh is in the air. More battlefields are sure to come.

to the ones situated near it. When the sun beats down from above and when it
feels as though it should be extremely hot, for some reason it's not. Perhaps
this land and the land around it has had a curse or perhap enchantment placed
upon it. The night sky brings the cold, which is quite a contrast to the hot
daytime temperatures. It is rumored that the captain of the minotaur warriors
is the most fiercest warrior in all the land. That his unmerciful ways has
gotten him a following of only the strongest minotaur warriors. He leads his
band with ease in battle and destroyes ememies viciously. The orcish warlords
live in fear of him also. The wind picks up sending dirt into the air.

small print, another plaque reads 'Captain Saryarz'. There is a huge pole in
the center of the room that upholds the center portion of the tent. Rope runs

keep the tent up. The poles are nailed to the ground and run toward the huge
center pole, providing space. A flap to the north is the only exit out of the
tent. Captain Saryarz is the most feared minotaur captain ever. He has taken
out any number of foes with his great axe and eaten their livers. His horns
have impaled enemies without mercy. His one great strength is his vitality.

well. Perhaps this is the command center for the evil forces. Raised voices
can be heard from within arguing and carrying on.

The &+rWar&+LRoom~
   This large tent can hold a large number of people for strategic meetings. A
circular table in the center of the room has many geographical maps and
various logistic papers that hint at the purpose of this room, to wage war.
What good are troops if their leaders cannot coordinate an effective battle
plan. The tent is upheld from the outside by poles and an array of rope,
some of which is visible from within. There are a number of cabinets here
for storage. They must hold all the logistical information required for moving
an army and maintaining one. Feeding, supplying, and paying an army isn't the
easiest thing to do. It usually takes a well qualified accountant just do
manage the numbers and another just file them and locate them. The leaders of
this dark army take no chances with numbers and have hired any number of
persons to do their logistics. Drows are the smartest of the evil races. The
pair of drow that run a long opening and closing these cabinents are the
ones that are being paid to manage all logistics and report all feedback to
their commander. It is very dark here because sunlight hurts some of them.

   The road has been compacted into a surface as tough as steel. This region
was once a hilly grassland, but now its remnants have been turned into a
station from which to conduct a war from. Poles on either side of the path
have lanterns placed upon them to provide light during the night. During the
night, the evil creatures are on the prawl, and it's best to keep guard, which
warrants sentries pacing to and fro. A tent is to the south. The road runs
to the south and east. The camp is mostly composed of the evil orcish horde
and the minotaur warriors. It is a fierce army controlled by the one of the
greatest warlords to grace the evil underworld. His name is not spoken aloud
and there isn't much known about him. It is said that he unified these two
races with but one intent, to destroy the good in all this land.

It houses the foot soldiers of the army and the new recruits. There is a stinch
coming from the east. There is a large building to the east with many soldiers
entering and exiting from it. It seems as if the smell is coming from that
building. It is a relief when the breeze picks up because it clears the smell.

The &+yHalfling &+mCaptain Quarters~
&+m   The halfling that resides here controls the halfling regiment of the good
&+marmy. He stands just above four feet tall, a moderate size for this guy. His
&+mbig hairy feet do not cause him any grief when it comes time to kick some ass.
&+mHe is reknowned in his camp for leading raids and overall kicking some evil
&+mbooty. A few desks outline the office. Windows allow sunlight in during the
&+mday and it seems as though this office was built to last, as opposed to a
&+mtemporary residence. Part of the army is designated under his command. The
&+mother part of the army is under the control of two other warlords. The
&+mhumans are under the sovereign the the great warlord Dooku. He was former
&+mpaladin who fell because of the vileness of his deeds, however, he is still
&+ma tenacious fighter who hates all underworld dwellers. The barbarians are
&+mlead by the great barbarian warlord Armes, who is strong in brawn as he is
&+min spirit. He is a shaman juggles the skulls of the evil under world
&+mdwellers in his hands. Together these warlords put together this expedition
&+mto stop the evil empire of orcs and minotaurs from spreading any further
&+minto innocent lands.

&+WJustification of this sort of treatment is simple, if they don't touch it or
&+Wsee it, than they won't even begin to think about fooling with it, and end up
&+Wblowing up the entire tower.  However, despite being trapped in this room until
&+Wit is befitting magi to entertain a visitor, the room has many decorative and

Nearing the&+L Outhouse~
   A horrific stinch fills the air. A scathouse to the east seems to be the
source of the foul odor. Soldiers need three things to function in this
army; food, water, and a place to scat. The officers of this camp have taken
care of all three. The truth be known about this camp is that the soldiers
here are unruly. If they're under control they're not killing eachother. The
orcs have no order but the minotaur do. The two races are completely different
yet drawn together for the same cause. Minotaurs are a proud race of evils
while the orcs are a despotic race known to turn against eachother in a
momements notice. The captains of this campaign must keep them focused on the
enemy at all times so they don't turn on one another.

&+LWithin the Outhouse~
   The walls are covered in feces and urine. The stools look like they've been
dragged in the mud and hammered by rapiers. An open window does little to
relieve the stench of the scathouse and orcs come from all over the encampment
to their business. There are very few walls in this complex, the stools sit
next to each other, and there is no means to wipe one's ass. It looks as if
the evils in here have taken to playing with their own bodily waste as it is
threwn against the walls. It is an ungodly site. The few goblins that have
taken up this crusade have been given the responsibility of cleaning up this
scathouse, a responsibility they don't take seriously.

&+L   It is here where the monks that built the temple created the other portion

&+Lthem. This tunnel is well defined, huge beams uphold the ceiling above. Roots
&+Lare visible from the trees above. These roots are very thick and wet. They are
&+Lvisible through the dirt, at one time they must have covered the entire area
&+Lthat is the tunnel, however, a short stroke of a sword can put an end to any
&+Lunwanted tree root. The tunnel is very dark and wet. It is also very cramped.

Before a Large &+gMes&+Gsh&+gall~
   A large superstructure to the west has a feint smell emitting from it, the
smell of grub. It is obvious from the amount of trash littering the entrance
of this building and from the types of trash that it is a messhall. Messhalls
are well reknowned for their grub and serve as a refuge for those who've
experienced the battlefield horrors and have survived. A few spots of vomit
here and there are very contrasting with the smell of grub. The soldiers of
this army need someplace to sleep as well. There are some barracks to the
south. These barracks are open to anyone of the army but only the lowly
soldier sleeps there. The upper command of the army have their own stations.

Within a Large &+gMes&+Gsh&+gall~
   From the time a soldier steps into this place, he is doused with food from
all angles. New soldiers often fall victim to this sort of treatment, whether
they be minotaur or orc is of no consequence. The messhall has a number of
tables from which to sit upon. The only non-accessible region of the messhall
would be the kitchen. Aside from that the soldiers are allowed to wander about.
Food is often taken for granted by the evil forces here. They don't only munch
on grub, but they munch on each other as well. Orcs are reknown for eatting
man flesh. Minotaurs are said to eat a raw rabbit as well. These evil beings
feast on things that any ordinary surface dweller wouldn't even consider.

&+Lthis structure, there are however guards posted outside to the north who
&+Lwould notify those inside incase enemy troops are spotted in their proximity.
&+LThe halfling contigement is the most deadly ever faced by the forces of

A &nWhi&+Ltewas&nhed Hallway~
   Monks from a century ago once lived here. It is here that the secret
path they dug through the dirt opens up onto the surface. This path was meant
to be a great secret only known to them. It was supposed to be a means of
concealing what the monks consider most important to them, ancient books
of knowledge. These texts are were collected from all around the world. There
were many different magical books containing many spells and enchantments lost
to the world of the magi. They summoned conjureres and master wizards to
this place in order to identify some of these books, however, these arrogant
magi-users refused the summons. Their arrogance must have lead to something
catastrophic. Perhaps the monks delved too deep into these mysterious books
and stumbled onto something most terrible.

&+LAbandoned Sle&nepi&+Lng &nChambers~
&+L   This stone room was onced used by the monks as a sleeping room. There isn't
&+Lmuch to see here except the cold vine covered stone of the floors and walls.
&+LThere are a few snakeskins here and there. Spiderwebs with broken shells
&+Lcover the corners of the room. There is a slight stinch to the air. All
&+Lmonks need to sleep, so in a great show of sagacity the monks decided
&+Lto build a sleeping chamber within the new walls of their temple. This
&+Lchamber could house a great number of people if ever called upon to do so.
&+LThere are no beds, but there are blankets sprawled across the room in a chaotic
&+Lorder. Further, most of the blankets look as tho they've not been used in
&+Lcenturies, for they look ready to tear upon touch and are very wet.

Ove&+Lrloo&nking a Large &+LCa&+yve&+Lrn~
   It is from this vantage point that one can see what the monks who lived in
these runes had next on their agenda. To the north and some distance down a
large cavern is visible. This cavern was newly dug at some point in tim but
do to the sudden departure of the those who were building it was never
completed. This cavern looks to be a cliff in the forest in which this temple
resides. Above on the cliff, many trees are visible, shading out any sunlight
that might penetrate or touch upon any one of the workers that were working
upon the tunnel that was being dug. A ladder runs down a cliff, allowing easy
access to this work site or one could run north and fall flat on his ass.

have tried repeatedly to force the good forces to the north to retreat. They've
fought so many battles that both sides have lost considerable numbers. The
river seems inviting. Not only does it offer an escape from the dangerous
humidity in the air, but it gives that at which is not readily available
in the region, fresh drinking water. Weeds and algae along the shore come to
an abrupt end as a trail leads into the river, clearly the river is shallow
within this section, for booted feet are visible in the mud below the water.

Before a &+LStone Gate~
   This seems to have been a battlefield at one point in time because many
corpses cover this hill. The hilly grassland that once was this region is
no more. Burning brush and weapons of war create a thick smoke that clouds
the area. The only thing that defines this hill is the parapet to the south.
To the north the battlefield continues with ten times the destruction. Halfling
and human corpses are testiment to failed attempts to take the gate. The
orcish warriors have taken the lives of innumerable amount of valiant halfling
and humans. The paladins can be seen searching for survivers. Clerics are in
short demand. The halfling wizards probe the gate for any signs of weakness
while the most clever of the halflings attempt to scale the wall. The stinch
of death is appaling. The stone gate looks to have taken a beating. Magical
fireballs conjured by halfling sorcery have struck at the tower time and
again causing serious damage to the occupants within. Ballista missiles sent
by the halfling engineers have nearly caused the collossal gate to fall.
It is only a matter of time before the forces of good conquer the evil within.

&+r   What remains of this battlefield is horrific. Just remaining in the
&+Lvicinity is a sheer test of willpower. The monstrousities visible within this
&+gplain could cause anyone, even the strongest of the strongest, to faint. Many
&+Lbodies have been burnt to to a crisp. The weapons of war that are burning
&+rcreate a thick black smoke cloud that envelopes everything. The ballistas,
&+gcatapults, and caravans all belonging to the halfling and orcish armies are
&+Lall charred and no longer functional. Spears with impaled soldiers mark the
&+Yspot where any survivors were mangled and killed. Some sections of the plain
&+Lburn steadily. Many of the dead have arrows and swords stuck into their
&+Wbellies. A few have been burned beyond recognition by magical means. This was
&+Rone of the original battlegrounds when the fight was joined by the halflings.
&+WThey managed to cut down the enemy forces with their machines and vicious
&+Ywarrior ways. The wizards brought down the forces of destruction to destroy
&+gthe evil orcish hordes and mighty minotaur might. The barbarians avoid this
&+Wplace as it is a testiment to their failure to win a battle yet against the
&+Yvicious evil army. The evils learned that the halflings should not be taken
&+glightly.

&nApproaching a &+LSentry Outpost&n~
   A moutain range is visible to the far north east, and the sounds of battle
echo in the air. Shouts from the distance are audible but not understandable.
Smoke to the north hint a battle of some sort or maybe an encampment. This
gravel trail is about ten feet in width and stretches through the hilly plains.
The halflings make up the bulk of the goodie army. They have joined forces with
a few noble paladins and some tribal barbarians. Together they fight against
the evil warlords of the minotaurs and orcish horde. The halflings aren't the
fiercest fighters but they're the most clever. Their magic users can cause
great devastation to an enemy force. A tiny influx of magic can cause a battle
to go this way or that. The orcs and minotaurs aren't that strong in magic,
however, they more than make up for that in brute strength.

&+Rthe terrors of hell would drive one insane but the evil forces at work here
&+Rhave taken it one step further. Evil spirits forever imprisoned within this
&+Rdomain hover above a heavily fortified gate. They scream the sounds of death,
&+Rthe scretching sounds of horror. The devilish gate is fortified by devils
&+Rof unspeakable power, beings that could topple kingdoms with an utter breath.
&+RThe walls are littered with souls of many unfortunate dead, the ones who were
&+Rcaught unawares whilst the evil took their lives. The infernal sky has an
&+Reerie glow to it. It is the aclove for lost souls. An ablazed stone has
&+Rsome legible carvings edged into it and sits several feet before the gate.

   A camp fire burns steadily in the center of this camp. There are tents set
up in a circle formation. Logs for soldiers to sit upon are sprawled around
a fire. Soldiers tell tales about the fire at night and also setwatch for the
night. From the looks of things these soldiers have been encamped for a long
time. This is the halfling encampment and its mostly full of halflings. There
are no other goodie encampments except the barbarian one. The barbarians
are encampment near here to the northeast. They are fierce fighters who have
contributed a great deal. This campaign is also joined by a few noble human
paladins. These paladins have enormous power. They heal the injured as well as
they destroy the evil. This battle has been joined by both sides for weeks now
and the effects of the conflict is effident in the faces of these halflings.
A great many of them have died in this conflict with no end in sight.

corpses litter this hill. The hilly grassland that once was this region is
no more. Burning brush and smoke clouds the area. There is a parapet to the
south that is manned by the orcish horde. They continue fighting the halflings
and do so fiercely. To the south the battlefield continues with ten times the
destruction. From this vantage point the massive destruction can be taken in.
It is difficult not to flench from the brutallity of it all. There are so many
mutilated corpses of halflings and charred remains of orcs and minotaurs. These
two forces have been at it for some time. Halfling wizards have been inflicted
a great blow to the orcish and minotaur armies and they likewise have brutally
killed a great many halflings and barbarians. Clouds of smoke rise.

An&+L Abandoned Worksite~
   Many tools that were carelessly left out in the open have been overtaken
by the forest. The owners of the tools must have left in haste because they
they are laid sprawled upon the ground as if dropped or thrown. A few
benches are visible, however, they are no longer functional it seems. Some
are missing legs and others are totally covered with vines and various plant
life. To the north, a large cavern opens up. It looks as if this was a place
people came and went to on a regular basis. Whatever it took to get them to
abandon their place of worship and work must have been extraordinary.

A Large &+LCavern Opening~
   Sounds echo within these chambers easily. It is here where the cavern is
not quite a cavern and not quite a forest. This is where the forest and the
cavern meet, so in reality, this is on the fringe of both worlds. The
cavern is rather dark and continues somewhat in a downward slope and the
passageway to the outside world, the forest, is to the south. There are many
eggshells here and snakeskins as well. This forest is has many predators.
These snakes that live here are said to swallow small children whole. The
spiders are said to be venomous and humongous. Arachnids are scary and most
people try to avoid them and snakes that swallow children whole are avoided
as well.

A &+LNarrow Landing~
&+L   Rising over forty feet in height, the obsidian pillars are completely awe
&+Linspiring. Poles give support to the domed shaped ceiling. Puddles of blood
&+Lseep into the crevices on the floor, and cracks on the walls. Bones and
&+Ldifferent types of refuse cover the area, while piles of rubble inhibit the
&+Lpath of travel. Above, the ceiling gives way to what looks like an opening.
&+LThis chamber looks centuries old. It must have been forged by some ancient
&+Lcivilization. The monks that lived here must have stumbled upon this chamber
&+Lby accident. Perhaps they stumbled upon some sort of dark power. Maybe this
&+Lplace has a curse laid down upon it. There is a slight stinch in the air.

&+LStrange runes are barely visible among the rising walls and along the floor.
&+LThe runes hum softly, which is faintly audible. Pools of blood mark the area
&+Las a battle field. The battle that took place here must have been magical
&+Lin origin, for there are many scorched sections wall here and there. There
&+Lis almost nothing to be seen here except broken eggshells of some sort of
&+Lcreature. Sounds echo easily within these walls. Whoever built this place
&+Lmust have long sinced abandoned it centuries ago.

Before a Small &+yHut~
   This is where the small trail in the forest splits into two paths of travel;
to the west a small hut is visible, while to the east nothing but forest. A
slight breeze in the air stirs the moisture that makes it difficult to breath.
The plant life is very thick and impregnable anywhere off the trail. This
forest seems to house some of the most active animals in the world for they
hustle this way and that. This forest is very old. The trees seem to whisper.
The night can be lonely in this here. With nothing to keep the cold night air
off your backs and can be even lonelier still.

A &+LDense &+gForest~
   The trees prevent any sunlight to shine here. Tall evergreens have grown
hundreds of feet into the air. They are hundreds of years old. There are
vines that dangle from the branches. Squirrels run along the tree branches.
The ground is covered in leaves and brush. The forest is thick with all sorts
of plants and animals. Monkies swing from branches and snakes rustle in the
brush. A thick underbrush just to the east makes travelling difficult at best,
however, to the north it is considerably lighter. There's an eerie sensation
here, as if something is not quite right. It seems as if something is waiting.

&+RDomain of Lost Souls~
&+R   The sentries of the tower are kept here. These keepers are servants of the
&+Rlord that resides within this tower and obey only his bidding. Some beasts
&+Rwhere summoned from other dimensions, some conjured through magic. In either
&+Rcase, they're here to do one thing and to destroy any infidel who hasthenerve
&+Rto desanctify his domain. Pit fiends snarl viciously, hydras shreak with
&+Rrage, and shadows engulf the room.  Indeed, it would take the hand of god to
&+Rmatch what this domain beholds.

&+RAn Observatory~
&+R   The walls are ablaze and the heat of which could melt rock. These flames
&+Rspew sporadically through the room, scorching all within proximity. In
&+Rthe center of this fiery hell there is a circular orb, the size of which
&+Rcan not possibly be measured. It appears to have an indefinite nature
&+Rabout it and seems to perceive one's thoughts and reflect different visions
&+Rto one's mind in correspondence. Within the center of this black orb, an
&+Rarray of lights is visible. It is impossible to discern what the light is,
&+Rwhich leaves it up to speculation. Could it be the cosmos? Or could it
&+Rbe trapped souls.

An &+yAbandoned Sentry &+LPost~
   A long time ago this was once some sort of post. There are two small
bamboo towers on either side of the forest path. It must have been some sort
of look out tower or something. They don't rise very high and aren't very
stable. There is a large box at the foot of each tower. The lock has been
rusted shut but the continents must be centuries old. It is doubtful that
anything of value can be found within these boxes. The forest isn't as thick
as it normally is which means this was once a constantly occupied post.
Perhaps there were sentries here at one time. Or perhaps this was a ranger
station. Squirrels race in the tree branches above.

Approaching an&+L Village Gate~
   The trail is headed to a small gate of some sort. The gate is totally
covered with vines and moss, henceforth, it blends in perfectly with the
forest in which is resides. The gate looks like its not been opened in
some time and no trails lead to or from it. The forest's plant life and
growth seems very dense, making most of the forest impregnable. Water drips
from vines above, the air is filled with humidity, and the ground feels slimy.
During the night the sky forest is very dark. No moonlight even reaches the
forest floor. Leaves and strong brush make traveling difficult. Squirrels
rustle in the trees above. A gentle breeze stirs the branches.

Gates of a &+LLost Village~
   The gates were constructed using bamboo and some type of tough bark. The
gates stand a little over six feet up in the air with vines covering them
every square inch of the way. It seems as though the doors might have
prevented animals and beings alike from entering, however, now it doesn't
look as though it could keep a small rodent from entering. This village has
long since been abandoned. It was some sort of logging village. It must have
had many shops and houses. Perhaps there are valuables here still that were
left. Nothing is known about this village but something is sure to be known
about it soon. The night is lonely here.

&+Lthe bamboo frame is totally molded and covered with vines. The moisture seems
&+Lto have accrued for many years. What looks like a trail opens up towards the
&+Least and to the north. Both paths of travel seem identical; vines dangle from
&+Lthe trees above, dripping water and further dampening the ground, which
&+Llooks to be incredibly soggy and plagueed with much plant life.

&+Rsmall cricket in the jungle in some distant land, he would find you and evoke
&+Rhis revenge for even daring to set foot upon his threshold. There is no
&+Rescaping him, for this being is all powerful. &+RThunder cackles through the air,
&+Rconstant exposure would lead to the &+Rdestruction of one's earlobs, meaning
&+Rdeafness. Fire spews from the ground, &+Rincenerating all that it touches.  This

&+LA Crudely Built &+yHut&n~
&+L   This hut seems to have decayed over the years and due to the builders poor
&+Lcraftsmanship the process was only hastened. There aren't many &+mde&+ccorati&+mve&n
&+Litems that most cottages would have and most everything that is here looks to
&+Lbe second rate. This hut clearly was built in haste to house its inhabitants
&+Land shelter them from the elements. Moisture lingers in the air.

&+LAlong a Small &+bSt&+Brea&+bm &+Lnext to a Wind&+ymill~
&+L   The humidity in the air is horrifying, making it difficult to breath. Some
&+Lanimals stir in the underbruss. The animals are well hidden and it's difficult
&+Lto determine what they are. The stream that passes by this small village is
&+Lthe source of much drinking water and power. A windmill is clearly visible
&+Lto the east and a large hut can be seen to the north.

A &+LDead End~
&+L   There are rumors in the outside world of a long forgotten portal to another
&+Ldimension. This dimension is said to be that of the gods. It was said that
&+Lit was stumbled upon by some fools digging for silver in a mine and that the
&+Lminers were so afraid for their lives they abandoned the mines after striking
&+Lsilver in the heart of it. It is said that they purposely collasped the mine
&+Lin order to seal away what they had discovered. Centuries passed since this
&+Lhas happened. None know the whereabouts of this mine or even if it existed.
&+LOne thing is for certain, the obsidian walls are no longer falling apart.
&+LAlongside the walls, on either side, the huge cylinder pillars holding the
&+Lceiling in balance reflect your image and your thoughts. Bones lay about the
&+Lfloor. Many various types of beasts have had their last breath here. Refuse
&+Land rubble no longer cover the floor.

&+yHut&+L of the &+bBo&+Bttl&+bers~
&+L   This is where the village got its&+W fresh&n &+Lsupply of&+b water&+L. A few of the
&+Linhabitants were charged with collecting fresh water each day and processing it
&+Lto get a lot of the &+Limpurities&+L out. The finished product would be bottled, and
&+Lstored until further need. The machines that are used to process the water
&+Lare rather unique and seem to function well. There isn't much to see here.
&+LIt is very dark and the place is cramped. This is shelter from the nightsky
&+Lbut it is inhabited by rodents mostly. They scurry along the floor. There are
&+Lcobwebs in some of the corners of the room.

&+L   This is how the village got its supply of &+bwater&+L. The &+Lwind&+ymill&+L also is used
&+Lto power the machines to process the water to get the impurities out. The
&+Lwindmill is still functional and it must have kept all of the village up when
&+Lit was in use, for it is very loud. The wood is beginning to rot however, and
&+Lthe walls seem to &+Lsag&+L. Years of abandonment has turned this once well
&+Loiled machine into nothing but water logged lumber. Apes and chimps come here
&+La lot. There are traces of fur and waste. Snakes are curled up in nests in
&+Lsomeplaces as well. This place is very damp and dangerous.

&+LThe air is filled with moisture and the sun when shining has nearly no chance

&+Lday. Maybe this place has a curse placed upon it, for what else could explain
&+Lthis paradox. There are no animals visible, nor the sounds accompanying them.
&+LFor all intensive purposes this place if for the dead, literally. Dug graves
&+Lwith head tombs are lined up in order, perpendicular to each other in every
&+Lrespect. It's nearly impossible to read out the names that are enscribed into
&+Lthem simply because the vegetation in this region has grown out of control.

&+LSplit in the Eastern &+yTr&+Lai&+yl~
&+L   The trail comes to a split. A large cabin of some sort is built to the
&+Lnorth with a wooden gate surrounding it. The cabin was built using bamboo
&+Land the lumber from the trees its centered around. The trail leads southward
&+Lalso and it's possible to get a glimpse of another building of some sort, a
&+Lrather large one. The sounds of the animal life of the forest reigns supreme,
&+Lsimply because there hasn't been enough activity within this village to stir
&+La restless kender from a good nap.

&+Lrace along the branches edges. A whirl from the wind could create an odd

hundreds of feet into the air. They are hundreds of years old. There are

The ground is covered in leaves and brush. The forest is thick with all sorts
of plants and animals. Monkies swing from branches and snakes rustle in the
brush. A thick underbrush just to the east makes travelling difficult at best,
however, to the north it is considerably lighter. There's an eerie sensation
here, as if something is not quite right. It seems as if something is waiting.

Inside &+GHerbal &+yLure~
&+L   During the course of this tiny village's history, they must have deemed it
&+Lwise to build shops out of sheer necessity. Without some sort of enterprise
&+Lwithin the community the village would wither and die. So, several shops were
&+Lconstructed to stimulate the economy and to give people incentives for working.
&+LThere's however, not anything to buy in this shop, for there is no merchandise
&+Lon the counters or the display tables. The villagers must have taken their
&+Litems of this store with them when they abandoned the village. There hasn't
&+Lbeen anyone in this village for some time. Centuries seem to have passed sinced
&+Lit has been abandoned. There are many vines and other forest plants running
&+Linto the shop from broken windows and from the roof above.

&+Limpregnable fortress in some places. Moss, undergrowth, and various other
&+Lplant life covers the ground. Tredding here is very hazardous. The sun
&+Llooks to not have shone here quite some time. With so much moisture in
&+Lthe air it makes breathing an effort. The trail forms turns to the west some
&+Lof the ways to the north. The plants here are very thick and tear at
&+Lclothing. The night sky brings a terrible cold that penetrates deep. Its best
&+Lto find shelter and a warm fire when night comes. During the day the sun
&+Lnever seems to shine here. Thick branches and healthy leaves complete block
&+Lout the sun and it is very dark, even for the day.

&+Lthe shape of an oval with the exit to the south. In the center of the room,
&+La bulletin board still stands, with posts still visible, however so slightly.
&+LMost of the post are still legible, however, they state the news of some years
&+Learlier and only serve as  clue to this village's past. The roof of this
&+Lbuilding doesn't appear all too stable. Years of moisture soaking into the

&+Lsometime ago. There is a slight stinch to the air. Travel within the corridor
&+Lis difficult because of all the debris that cover the corridor. It seems as
&+La dark force is at work within these walls and it welcomes flesh blood.
&+LSpider webs cover the area. Perhaps these wicked little critters have made
&+Lthese corridors their refuge. These nasty little things can be venomous.

&+Yentering the tower to the north and haven't succeeded in discovering its
&+Ysecrets. It is said that even a few of their most powerful magi have entered
&+Yand not come out. This magical tower must have wards of some type and many
&+Ymysterious riddles to be solved inside.

On a Small &+bMoat~
&+b   This moat is only eight feet deep, yet it prevents heavy machinery from
&+bentering the tower's defense. It's strong walls have been magically enhanced
&+bto prevent even the slightest arrow from flying ten feet near it. The only
&+bmeans of entering the castle would be through the front gate, through a ground
&+bassault. The magi who created this tower had other means of entering it,
&+bhowever. Rumor has it that they had at one time had a special word only known
&+bto them, that once spoken, magically unlocked the door for anyone to enter.
&+bThe minotaur sorcerers and drow magi have tried to reveal the secrets locked
&+baway in this tower with no avail.

&+LThe Tower Entrance~
&+r   This is where the portcullis lifts and allows entry way into the keep.
&+rwhat is on the otherside is left to the imagination. The portcullis has many
&+rrunes embedded upon it. The magic inscribed upon it was written in a language
&+ronly native to magic users. One could drown him or herself with words trying
&+rto decipher just what they mean. To the south, the huge drawbridge allows an
&+ra narrow passage to and from this place. There is no roof, only two walls
&+ron either side and the portcullis to the north.

A &+WStudy~
   There are no chairs and no tables in this library. There are, however,
books. Rows and rows of books lined up into columns in the northern corner
of the chamber. The books seem to never end, an infinite number of books to
select to read is a greater treasure than a pile of&+Y gold&n that could
stretch across the world ten feet high ten times over. Choosing a book is
not as difficult as it might seem, however, for all one has todo is summon
the name of the book into mind, and it appears as if beckoned. Studying is
a arduous task, that is why it takes a silent place to do it in. Noise is
not permitted within these chambers for just that reason. Studying is even
harder without chairs and tables to do it with, however, the magi are magi
after all. One doesn't need a chair when he can hover, and one doesn't need
a table, when the books float on a cushion of&+c air&n. The wealth of the
magi is unparalleled, any student of the art would give anything just to have
the chance to study here.

A &+WChamber~
   It is here that the master of this tower slept. It is unclear whether
this master studied the dark arts or just dabbled into everything he could.
It is said that renegade magis don't consider themselves evil even though
they wield the dark art as well as any evil mage. These renegade mages are
said to experiment in potion making as well and live relatively quiet lives.
A small bed remains dormant in the west side of the room. No one has
slept there in a long while. The room seems alive and there is no trace
of the dust within these chambers that usually accompanies abandonment.
A small candle burns on a desk in the far corner of the room, alongside
a large compartment where spell components are kept. The large rug
in the center of the room has an a marvelous design upon it. The design of a
magi with an odd looking design upon it. The design looks life like, and
appears that at any given moment.

A &+WLaboratory~
   This is the concoction chamber. Anything and everything can be created
within these walls. Racks and racks of potions are lined up according to
what they do. Only those who conjured these potions know just what they do
and what they can do is a mystery. There are many tables and counters within
this lab and they are spotless. It seems as if time hasn't effected this
place even though it has been existence for many decades. Perhaps some of
these potions can give eternal youth. Some of these potions swirl and some
even glow. There are big ones little ones. It is a mystery.

The &+WAltar &nof &+CLife&n and &+LDeath~
&+W   Two cylinder columns outline the area, with a large altar in the center.
&+WThis altar is made of granite and has a width of about five feet and a total
&+Wlength of seven feet. It rises into the air with a height of four feet. Power
&+Wiminates from its base and radiates all around the area. Giving life would
&+Wbe an easy task for this altar, taking it away would would be even easier.
&+WThe room itself is about twenty feet high and fifteen feet by fifteen feet.
&+WRunes of preservation cover the walls, ceiling, floor, and even the altar.
&+WLegend has it that an altar such as this could give birth to a new world or
&+Wtake one away. It glows softly.
