   &+gThe forest ends here, the terrain changing into the murky swamp which &N
&+gleads off to the east. Even the usual sounds of the forest have died, &N
&+gbecoming one of deafening silence as the foulness of the swamp begins. To &N
&+gthe east a rope bridge can be seen, spanning across a small stream. The&N
&+glush forest continues off to the west. &+WA small sign, covered in vines rests&N
