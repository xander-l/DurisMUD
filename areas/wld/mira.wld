&+yA Well Worn &+LPath&n~
&+y   This path appears to be constantly used. Even now it is being used by both
&+ytrade caravans and military transports. Not far north is the city of
&+MMyrabolus&+y, capital of the defending armies. Directly south is No Man's Land.
&+yA wide area where hundreds of thousands have died both attacking and
&+ydefending the city. Row after row of crosses systematically flank this road,
&+yproving this could just possibly be the most sought after strategic location
&+yon the continent.&n

The &+YGates&n of &+MMyrabolus&n~
   Rumors have said that even the &+rimmortals&n themselves have not been able
to penetrate the walls of this amazing city. The &+Ygates&n are made of four
feet of solid &+yoak&n, the &+Wwalls&n, six feet of &+Lstone&n. To physically break in
would be next to impossible, but intruders must also be warned of not
the &+Rarch&+Wers&n watching carefully in the twin parapets above, but the immense
&+barcane energies&n that have been fused with both these &+Wwalls&n and &+Ygates&n,
protecting from any sort of &+bmagical&n entry.

   This is the first main insection in the city. &+YGate &+LRoad&n runs east
to west parallel &+CMarket &+LRoad&n and &+yAncients Avenue&n. Inside the gates
a huge &+Rred&n painted sign reads:
        &+W'Welcome to &+MMyrabolus&+W, Home of the &+gHunters&n.'
The peaceful citizens of the town welcome all visitors warmly and offer
directions to all this great city's attractions.  The Highway here runs
straight north here, directly towards the palace gates.&n

&+rMagistrate&n. The fountain is contructed from &+Wwhite &+wmarble&n and shaped like
the &+MMyrabolan&n elite guard's cresent &+Wmoon&n insignia with a &+Lblack&n stone
sword rising from the &+Wfountain's&n base to impale the &+Wmoon&n.  It represents

   Just a couple blocks from the &+Wpalace&n, &+Mtwo&n &+Ltowers&n raise above
the city on each side of the highway. They are the last and very
rarely used defense against &+Lair&+yships&n and &+Gdragon&n and &+ygrif&+wfon&n riders.
Not only are the most elite &+Warc&+rhers&n stationed in these &+Ltowers&n as well
a mechanical, perhaps even &+bmagical&n, contrapation that appears to sling
a dozen &+war&+rrows&n at a time.

&+RRising &+YSun &+wCorridor~
   This &+Wcorridor&n leads to a few of rentable rooms of the &+RRising &+YSun
inn. Various paintings and tapestries are hung from the walls, mostly
images of the &+gHunters&n doing battle with all forms of devils and dragons,
capturing them and freezing them in time of their most &+Wglorious&n moments.

Their support to him still carries a great deal of wieght in the city, but

Central Mast of the &+YSun&+Lwea&+Yver~
   &+yNot only does this mast serve as the primary navigation post on the
&+yvessel but it also a focal point for the balloon. The huge cloth sphere
&+yis fastened tightly here so it wont break free during ascent or descent.
&+yUnlike a sailing ship, the only sails working here are for directional
&+yuse only and open up from the bottom and sides of the &+Lship.

The High &+rMagistrate's&n Quarters~
   Probably the most well guarded room in the entire &+Mcity&n, making
it here is quite a feat.  Tucked away onboard the &+YSun&+Lwea&+Yver
is a quaint, tidy room, with dozens of bookshelves and a study desk.
This is where the &+rMagistrate&n spends his days and nights,
communicating with the rest of the city through couriers, ever since
he found out that his life was in danger.

&+yThe Western &+YBeach&n~
&+Y   This is small secluded beach along the northern coast of the
&+Ycontinent.  It runs in a small cresent from the north to the east
&+Ywith the ocean waves lapping against the shore.  The squawks from
&+Ythe seagulls and the voices from the road to the south make it
&+Yquite a noisey area here.&n

&+yThe Western &+YBeach&n~
&+Y   The sandy beach ends to the north here, as the ocean begins. This
&+Ysecluded area has a perfect lookout for the &+MMyrabolan&+Y Docks that lie
&+Yjust to the east of here, where the many ships in the harbour can be
&+Yseen floating on the gentle waves of the ocean.&n

&+bA Shallow &+YBeach&n~
&+b   The ocean begins here to the north, and it gets extremely deep
&+bextremely quickly.  Though the main docks of &+MMyrabolus&+b can be seen
&+bjust to the east of here, this area is rarely used.  The water here
&+bis very cold and almost freezes the skin while walking through it.
&+bThere is a small &+yraft&+b that has half washed up on shore here, rolling
&+bup and down on the waves that lap across the &+Ybeach&+b to the south.&n

&+yThe Pier&n~
&+y   This is the single pier that makes up the &+MMyrabolan&+Y Docks&+y.  Though
&+yno where near as large as the docks in other capital cities, the dock
&+ydoes serve its purpose well and is able to handle many ships in harbour
&+yat the same time.  Straight south are the gates of the docks that
&+yexit to the road to &+MMyrabolus&+y.&n

&+yof the time, the harbour master still keeps quite busy in checking
&+ythe incoming and outgoing ships.  The door to the west leads back

&+gA &+rSu&+c-Monster&+g Den&n~
&+g   The trail through the forest becomes far to thick to travel beyond
&+ghere and is probably only used by animals or the &+rsu&+c-monsters&+g that seem
&+gto have infested this area.  A large nest has been constructed by an
&+gextremely large su, who defends it viciously.  The nest itself seems
&+gto be built from bones and wood, held together by tree-sap.&n
