&+yOn the Shore of a &+BRiver &+gin the Dense Jungle&n~
   &+gThe jungle is a bit less dense here. The trees are not so close
&+gtogether, no longer forcing a single file march on a group. The leafy
&+gbranches overhead entwine, causing this area to be shadowy. The air
&+gis steamy and heavy. There is a river to the east.&n
