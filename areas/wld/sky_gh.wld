Before a Colossal Door~
This is the entrance to the Hall of the Skies. Before you is a colossal
doorway, and guarding it are possibly the most massive beings you have ever
seen--fearsome golems with blank stares on their faces. As a shiver runs
down your spine, it seems like it would be a good idea to let them be.

Main Hallway in the Hall of the Skies~
This is the Main Hallway of the Hall of the Skies. The floor under you is
completely transparent, and the outside world is completely visible from
beneath your feet. It seems as though the hallway extends north, but the
disorientation caused by the cloud floor makes you unsure.

The Hall Continues~
The cloud floor extends onward, and you think that you have went north. Still
highly disoriented, the room seems to go on forever, but you know that it
must end somewhere. A feeling of peace seems to radiate outward from this
entire area, and slowly the room begins to reform in your mind so that you
can comprehend where you are.

Inn of the Hall of the Skies~
There is a visible floor in this room, and everything once again seems solid.
Behind a counter stands a receptionist, smiling warmly at you. "What can I do
for you, friend?," he says. "Come take a rest here if you wish. It it free
for guild members."

Armory in the Hall of the Skies~
In this room is a solid wall and floors, as well as a large chest that appears
to hold equipment for the guild members. It seems like it could hold a lot of
things, and its sheer capacity is beyond anything you have ever seen or heard
of.
