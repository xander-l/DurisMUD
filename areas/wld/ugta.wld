&+COn a Narrow Trail, at the Entrance to a Large Camp&n~
&+c   The ground here is hard-packed, frozen solid from the constant
&+ccold air and precipitation.  A thin layer of permafrost covers the
&+cfrozen dirt beneath, causing footprints and wagon tracks to remain for
&+cmonths or even years.  Dark patches of lichen cover the ground and the
&+crare rock or boulder, breaking up the drab monotony of the largely
&+cgreyish terrain.  To the far north, the wide range of the snow-covered
&+cAkma mountain range can be seen.  A rough trail, cut out of the
&+cpermafrost, heads roughly north-south here.  Small tents can be seen to
&+cthe north, west, and east, and the occasional human form can be seen
&+cambling from one to another.  The faint burble of flowing water can
&+cbe heard to the west, somewhere out of sight.  The ground slopes upward
&+cto the north, blocking the view after several hundred feet.

&+YOn a Bridge Spanning the Ugta River&n~
&+y   A simple wooden bridge spans the narrow, fast-flowing Ugta River
&+ycoursing southward thirty feet below.  The bridge itself is of simple
&+yconstruction, two small logs, about twenty feet long, with flat
&+yboards nailed to them, spanning the length.  Clearly, the bridge has
&+ybeen made for easy transportability rather than durability.  To the
&+ywest and east, tents can be seen dotting the landscape.  The ground
&+yslopes gently southward, making it impossible to see more than a few
&+yhundred feet to the north.

&+ycoursing southward thirty feet below.  The bridge itself is of simple
&+yconstruction, two small logs, about twenty feet long, with flat
&+yboards nailed to them, spanning the length.  Clearly, the bridge has
&+ybeen made for easy transportability rather than durability.  To the
&+ywest and east, tents can be seen dotting the landscape.  The ground
&+yslopes gently southward, making it impossible to see more than a few
&+yhundred feet to the north.

&+c   The ground here is hard-packed, frozen solid from the constant
&+ccold air and precipitation.  A thin layer of permafrost covers the
&+cfrozen dirt beneath, causing footprints and wagon tracks to remain for
&+cmonths or even years.  Dark patches of lichen cover the ground and the
&+crare rock or boulder, breaking up the drab monotony of the largely
&+cgreyish terrain.  To the far north, the wide range of the snow-covered
&+cAkma mountain range can be seen.  A rough trail, cut out of the
&+cpermafrost, heads roughly north-south here.  Small tents can be seen to
&+cthe north, west, and east, and the occasional human form can be seen
&+cambling from one to another.  The ground slopes upward to the north,
&+cblocking the view after several hundred feet.

&+YInside a Caribouskin Tent&n~

&+yof the roughly forty foot square enclosure keeps the area warm,
&+ysmoke trailing out of a small hole in the top of the tent.  The
&+ytent stinks of animal fat and burning wood, and a faint cloud of
&+ysmoke hangs in the air.

&+y   There is scant little in the way of decoration; everything here
&+yis kept only because it is of some use to the nomadic inhabitants.
&+yShort cots are scattered about the area with no particular

&+YInside a Large Caribouskin Dining Tent&n~
&+y   Roughly two hundred feet to a side, this tent is large, especially
&+yby barbarian standards.  Standing forty feet tall at its highest
&+ypoint, the tent is supported by large wooden beams, a very rare
&+ycommodity here in the tundra.

&+y   A large bonfire burns in the center of the tent, creating a
&+ysurprising amount of heat and making the temperature of the area
&+yendurable.  Low wooden tables are arranged in ordered rows, with
&+yshort chairs on either side.  At the north end of the tent, a
&+ytaller table sits facing the rest, with a decidely more regal and
&+ydistinguished chair behind it.

&+y   Right now, the tent is mostly empty, but it's clear that this tent
&+yis the eating hall for the barbarians, used for meeting after a large
&+yhunt or holding a banquet for visiting VIPs.

&+YInside a Caribouskin Tent&n~
&+y   Here, inside this surprisingly large tent of caribou skins, the
&+ytemperature is almost livable.  A small campfire in the center
&+yof the roughly forty foot square enclosure keeps the area warm,
&+ysmoke trailing out of a small hole in the top of the tent.  The
&+ytent stinks of animal fat and burning wood, and a faint cloud of
&+ysmoke hangs in the air.

&+y   There is scant little in the way of decoration; everything here
&+yis kept only because it is of some use to the nomadic inhabitants.
&+yShort cots are scattered about the area with no particular
&+yorganization, and a few stone tools lie on the floor, most near the
&+yfoot of the cots.

&+ytemperature is quite hospitable.  A large campfire in the center
&+yof the roughly eighty foot square enclosure keeps the area warm,
&+ysmoke trailing out of a medium-sized hole in the top of the tent.
&+yThe tent stinks of animal fat and burning wood, and a faint cloud
&+yof smoke hangs in the air.

&+y   Near the center of the tent, next to the campfire, lies a large
&+ybearskin, clearly used for sitting upon.  A few loosely bound
&+ycollections of parchment are scattered about the tent, detailing
&+yvarious methods of making useful mixtures and calling upon the
&+yspirits to perform miraculous deeds.

&+CBarren Tundra&n~
&+c   The ground here is hard-packed, frozen solid from the constant
&+ccold air and precipitation.  A thin layer of permafrost covers the
&+cfrozen dirt beneath, causing footprints and wagon tracks to remain for
&+cmonths or even years.  Dark patches of lichen cover the ground and the
&+crare rock or boulder, breaking up the drab monotony of the largely
&+cgreyish terrain.  To the far north, the wide range of the snow-covered
&+cAkma mountain range can be seen.  Nothing but tundra stretches to the
&+cedges of the horizon, and the ground slopes gently down to the south.

&+LDark and rugged, the Akma Mountains reach up towards the sky for one or
&+Ltwo miles, easy.  Named after the man who first climbed to the top of
&+Lthe highest peak, the Akma Mountains are widely known as some of the most
&+Linhospitable in the world.

&+CIn the Frigid Waters of the Ugta River&n~
&+c   A river runs roughly north-south here, following the ground as it
&+cslopes gently down to the south.  The waters must be just barely above
&+cfreezing, as they are numbingly cold.  The river is not very wide or
&+cdeep at this point, only twenty feet wide at its widest and four or
&+cfive feet deep in the center.  Serving as the main watering point for
&+cwildlife and barbarians alike for miles around, the river flows from
&+csnowflows on the Akma Mountains far to the north, eventually joining
&+cother tributaries to the south, in warmer climes.

&+ytapestries hang from the tent supports, making the otherwise drab
&+ylandscape appear almost festive.  A large chair sits at the east end
&+yof this walled area, made of dark mahogany and with padding that looks

&+COn a Narrow Trail&n~
&+c   The ground here is hard-packed, frozen solid from the constant
&+ccold air and precipitation.  A thin layer of permafrost covers the
&+cfrozen dirt beneath, causing footprints and wagon tracks to remain for
&+cmonths or even years.  Dark patches of lichen cover the ground and the
&+crare rock or boulder, breaking up the drab monotony of the largely
&+cgreyish terrain.  To the far north, the wide range of the snow-covered
&+cAkma mountain range can be seen.  A rough trail, cut out of the
&+cpermafrost, heads roughly northeast-southwest here.  The Ugta River
&+ccan be seen flowing southward to the west, a simple bridge spanning the
&+cthirty foot gorge that the river has carved out over time.  The ground
&+cslopes upward to the north, blocking the view after several hundred
&+cfeet.

&+YOn a Bridge Spanning the Ugta River&n~
&+y   A simple wooden bridge spans the narrow, fast-flowing Ugta River
&+ycoursing southward thirty feet below.  The bridge itself is of simple
&+yconstruction, two small logs, about twenty feet long, with flat
&+yboards nailed to them, spanning the length.  Clearly, the bridge has
&+ybeen made for easy transportability rather than durability.  Dull
&+ygrey tundra stretches as far as the eye can see, broken only be the
&+ythin line of the river flowing from the mountains to the north to an
&+yunseen destination to the south.

Inside a Small Cave~
&+L   Dark, damp, and extremely cramped, this tiny crawlspace is
&+Lclaustrophia-inducing, to say the least.  To the west, through a
&+Lsmall hole in the rock, the tundra can be the seen.  To the east,
&+La space has been hollowed out of the permafrost and blocked off
&+Lby several caribou bones, stuck closely together and rigged on a
&+Lgate locked from this side.

&+L   With a floor hollowed out of the permafrost and walls and ceiling
&+Lof stone, this small area is not at all hospitable.  To the west, a

&+Lit is deemed that the poor sap prisoned within can be released.
