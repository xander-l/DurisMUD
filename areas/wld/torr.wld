&+c- &+Ydwarves&n, &+celves&n, &+Chumans&n, &+yhalflings&n.  &+cSailors and merchants
&+cpush their way through busily, but although there is much bustle
&+ca sense of &+Luneasiness&n &+ccan be felt.  Many of the stands are now
&+cempty and falling apart, the buildings surrounding have begun to look
&+cunkept and dirty.  This same &+bmarket&n &+conly a year ago would have seen
&+ctriple the merchants and sailors and stands filled to the top rather
&+cthan struggling as they are now.  The air is mixed with the &+Wsalty&n

&+bmagnificance.  The outer layer of the tower is made of a thick,
&+blight gray stone.  Only a few windows can be seen on the lower levels,
&+bbut higher above wide windows and balconies can be seen.  Although
&+bthe King and Queen often hold balls and banquets, even for the lowly
&+bcommoners and peasants, the palace is kept tightly locked up with
&+bguards protecting it on all sides.&n

&+mChipane Street&n~
&+m   The houses lining the streets begin to look larger here and finely
&+mkept, yet still far from royalty.  The roar of so many voices mixed
&+mtogether from the market dies down here.  A ways to the west the street
&+mintersects with &+gTalerenn Way&n &+mand to the east the road continues.&n

&+LAn Alley&n~
   About seven feet between two buildings make up this alley.  It's
neither creepy nor dark, but rather brightly lit with a few lamps attached
onto the sides of the buildings.  A couple nicely kept garbage cans are
along the side, a stray cat occasionally knocking them over.  The alley
continues a ways to the north, and back south is &+mChipane Street&n.

&+L   The alley ends here to the north, the back of a building blocking
&+Lthe way.  The light here is a bit dimmer, and from here the sounds of
&+Lthe nearby streets is very distant.  Sounds of the wind blowing between
&+Ltwo buildings is far from comforting.  On the side of the east
&+Lbuilding is a small, steel door that carries no ornaments but a simple
&+Lhandle.  Back south a ways lies the street.&n

&+LThe floors are carpeted in a deep red carpet, soft to the touch.
&+LA large round table centers the room, a solitary chair on the north
&+Lend and a few more on the other.  The lights in here are kept dim
&+Lbut still many of the paintings on the wall can be seen - those of
&+Ldetailed battles, victories, and losses.  There are also paintings of
&+Lpeople, such as a beautiful druidess communing with nature or a strong
&+Lsailor standing upon a ship.  An overall look of clutter fills the

&+Lscuffed walls.  Many hard wooden benches are pushed against the walls
&+Lfor those waiting to be seen.  Sailors of all ranks line up here

&+LA Hall Behind The Throne&n~
   The entrance behind you disappears, leading into a long, narrow
hallway.  The walls are made of thick grey stone, no paintings
or tapestries or even torches can be found here.  What secret lies
within here is unknown, but a terrible stench lies just north,
causing any normal person to wretch at the first inhale.  The
only exit is north.

&+LMusic can be heard, a soft humming at first, then a wild,
&+Lterrified screaming, droning into your ears, attacking them.
&+LWhat horrible creature created this place?  Deafening laughter,
&+Lnot of happiness or joy, but of pure evil pleasure fills
&+Lthe cavern walls.  The only exit is south, while a portal

&+LA&+Y Sandy&+y Path&n~
&+Y   This is probably the only part of the beach area that is
&+Ynot rocky but rather a smooth sand can be felt under your
&+Yfeet.  When the sun shines down on the sand through the
&+Yday the sand becomes hot, almost unbearably.  A small
&+Ybeach house can be seen to the north, while a rocky path
&+Yleads down to the beach south.&n

&+bA Small&+B Beach&+b House&n~
&+B   This beach house appears to be the remains of the old
&+Blighthouse, the walls made of a thick white stone.  The
&+Bsounds of the ocean echo upon the walls.  A large
&+Bwindow makes up for most of the wall facing the actual
&+Bbeach, allowing the sun to shine in during the day.&n
