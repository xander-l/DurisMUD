&+LBefore Some Massive Stone Gates&N~
   Well-worn granite flagstones line the floor here beneath the imposing walls
that stretch off to the north and south.  The archway here beneath the wall is
tranquil, but ominous.  Though many visitors once passed through this gate,
there is no sign that anyone has been by in recent times.  Dwarven handiwork is
evident in the stone gates that stand locked to the east, the gates and the
tall walls to which they are connected provide excellent protection from the
surrounding forest.  Narrow openings in the gates themselves reveal a large
mansion just beyond an overgrown courtyard.  The mansion appears to be
abandoned, though there are sounds that echo from the courtyard beyond that
would suggest that there is some life to be found.

The dwarven handiwork in the carved stone gates is evident in the smooth even
lines that have been carved throughout the gates themselves.  Supports as wide
around as a man's wrist are spaced just far enough apart that a spear or arrow
can be thrown through, but no further.  Though the gates are locked it is clear
that they are perfectly counter-weighted so that anyone with a key can easily
open them.

&+GIn an Overgrown Courtyard&N~
   Though not as overgrown and dark as the forest beyond the walls that enclose
this strange compound, the plants here have a twisted aspect to them that
matches the forest, and perhaps even magnifies its strangeness.  Once beautiful
flowering bushes and trees have been planted through out the courtyard as it
leads up to the small mansion to the east.  Time and lack of care have allowed
the plants to become overgrown to the point that they fight each other for
light and food.  That alone can't explain the twisted nature of everything in
the area.  It is as if the whole area has been put under a terrible curse, a
curse that has festered over time.  The mansion itself has a twisted facade
with broken windows and strangely twisted gargoyles that dangle over its
entryway.  Stone paths lead into the overgrown courtyard to the north and south
as well as off toward the stairs that lead up to the mansion's door.

&+GIn an Overgrown Courtyard&N~
   Tiny purple flowers bloom all along the thin climbing vines that stretch
their way up the wall to the south.  The blossoms exude a faint perfume that
smells much like that of roses.  Soft breezes rustle the branches of a nearby
pear tree.  The tree doesn't appear to have borne any fruit for many years now,
but its use as a decoration is easy to appreciate.  The original gardeners
chose trees and bushes that they could organize into beautiful three-
dimensional living artwork.  Such intricate gardening requires constant care
and attention, something that hasn't occurred here for centuries, meaning that
the garden is now so overgrown that it is impossible to see what the garden is
really designed to look like.

   Thin cracks line the now still fountain as it stands quietly in the corner
formed by the walls to the south and west.  Whatever magical pump must once
have sent water flowing along its graceful lines has ceased to function.  All
that remains is a pool of stagnant water at its bottom, water that some of the
surrounding vines and bushes appear to be reaching for.  A single flowering
plant stands alone nearby the fountain, perhaps it has been protected from
encroachment by the stone walkway that circles it.  Flagstone paths wind their
way through the courtyard shrouded slightly by some of the overgrown plants.

   Many of the plants here must grow at different rates.  Several of the trees
that stand in a line to the west were clearly designed to be trimmed to the
same height, but now they have grown to different heights and their branches
have grown in every direction.  The center trees have pink and yellow blossoms
whereas the flanking trees, which haven't grown as quickly, bear bright red
blossoms with faint purple veins.  Stone walkways wind through the small
courtyard so that visitors may view its beauty, a beauty that has been overcome
by the ugliness of brutal competition by the plants for light.

   Tucked into the corner formed by the walls to the north and west, this
fountain, though cracked and ancient, still flows.  The soft splash of the
water is quickly swallowed by the nearby plants which have grown so close to
the fountain that they threaten to swallow it completely.  This part of the
courtyard must once have been quite specatacular.  All of the plants here bear
blossoms of varying hues of purple and light blue, but they have grown into
each other, twisting and tearing at each other's branches for some sort of
advantage.  The plants, the courtyard, and everything nearby has a darkness to
it, an attractive beauty that has been twisted into something sinister.  It is
almost as if it is designed to draw people in and trap them.

   Thick vines climb some of the smaller bushes and trees here, strangling them
as they climb toward the sunlight.  Old flower buds, flowers which have shown
their colors and since collapsed upon themselves, droop from the vines and
bushes, cloaking whatever colors they once had.  Several narrow flagstone
pathways wind through the courtyard which is so overgrown in places that it is
difficult to even make out the stairway that leads into the mansion.  A narrow
path heads east between the northern wall and the mansion.  The path itself
appears to have once been used by servants and gardeners and has little
decoration except for the gate that allows entry to it.  The path has been
overgrown like the courtyard, but the tall wall and the mansion block most of
the light that reaches the ground there, giving everything beyond the small
gate a sinister darkness.

&+yA Barren Area in the Courtyard&N~
   Though surrounded by thick plants, this area is muddy and has only a few
struggling saplings.  Deep clawmarks scratch the ground and broken flagstones
have been tossed aside.  Some large beast must have taken a profound disliking
to this portion of the Courtyard for the destruction that has been wreaked here
is almost complete.  What is even more frightening however, is the fact that
some of the broken plants appear to be dripping fresh sap, an indication that
the destruction is quite recent.

&+GBefore a Long Stairway&N~
   Elegant white marble steps lead up to the doorway into a large mansion.  The
sturdy marble shows the wear of many feet, but the broken windows in the
mansion, and the lack of any lanterns suggests that they haven't been in use
for quite a long time.  The courtyard that extends to the north, south and west
was once a beautiful place, a place of wonder, bearing the type of elegance
that the very wealthy use to impress each other.  That time has long gone past,
now the courtyard is so overgrown that not even the finest gardener could
rescue it.  The plants have become intertwined and appear to be in some sort of
quiet struggle, slowly strangling each other out of existence.

   Some large burrowing creature has evidently made a burrow of some type
beneath a few of the bushes to the east.  The burrow has been cleverly done,
perfectly placed beneath the thorny branches of the bushes so that anyone
trying to enter it would be subject to some painful sticks at the same time
providing protection with a minimum of digging.  Only a creature with a
particularily thick hide would even bother to try to use such a den, yet such
creatures can certainly be found in many places throughout the world of Duris.

   This part of the courtyard has been planted with a number of beautiful
orchids, all of which now battle each other for position.  One plant with pale
pink blossoms has been clearly beaten out by the others, it has begun to wilt
and die, held up now only be the fact that the surrounding plants have become
so intertangled with it that it will never be set free.  The courtyard itself
continues to the north and east, planted with a variety of beautiful plants.
The beauty of the courtyard is tempered by a sinister presence, a ghastly
feeling of impending doom.

&+LA Long, Narrow Path&N~
   The tall wall to the north and the side of the mansion to the south enclose
this small path in a disheartening darkness.  Small round stones positioned
about ten feet above the ground along the mansion wall shed a vague light that
creates more shadows than illumination.  The magical light shed by the stones
must once have been fairly strong, but now they have faded so much that they
are more of a hindrance than a help.  It appears the thin strip of dirt between
the path and the northern wall was once used as a nursery by the gardeners, who
must nurture smaller plants before planting them in larger gardens.  The plants
growing there now have become dark and twisted, looking more dead than alive.
The path continues to the west toward the back of the mansion and a gate to
the east leads out to the courtyard in front of the mansion.

&+ySome Abandoned Servant's Quarters&N~
   When the mansion was great, proud, and well-visited it must have had many
servants to serve its owners and guests.  A number of beds line this room and
the room to the east, enough to house at least twelve to fourteen servants.  A
door into the room to the east must once have offered some privacy to those
living in that room, however, the door has been torn from its hinges and lies
cast aside.  It leans against a small dust-covered stove that must have been
used to cook meals for some of the servants when they were off-duty.  A sturdy
locked door leads into a room to the south and a second room full of beds is
to the east.

Most of the beds here have been broken or torn up, by someone or something in

additional blankets and rugs.  There are even boxes for extra clothing for the
guests of the mansion.  The southern wall is lined with casks of wine and ale
which are brightly lit by several glowing rods that have been placed on the
wall.  Unfortunately,  All of these items have decayed and rotted to the point
that all their value has been ruined.  If one wanted to risk having rotten
crates collapse on them they could search for a while but it is unlikely that
there is anything of value here.

   These windowless quarters clearly once housed the gardener's for the

servants for the mansion.  Seven sturdy wooden beds line the wall to the east,
all of them separated by privace curtains.  Along the long wall to the west
there is a small kitchen and a long table with matching chairs.  A small
bookcase in the southwest corner contains several books, most of which appear
to deal with varieties of plants, including one volume on meat-eating and
blood-sucking plants.  Thick layers of dust cover everything in the room, but
everything seems to be in pretty good shape.  A doors to the north and south

   Though some light appears to filter through the thick plants to the west,
there is very little light here.  What light does come down from the magical
stones set in the mansion wall to the south is vague and disconcerting.  The
pale blue light creates as many shadows as it illuminates, and the shadows
often appear to move with a life of their own.  This narrow path ends at a
gate immediately to the east and continues west toward the front of the
mansion.  Beyond the gate an immense garden can be seen, a garden that has
been overgrown for many years.

   This garden was clearly a masterpiece at some time in the past.  Those with
extraordinary wealth choose many ways to show off thier money, this garden was
once such a display of wealth.  Something has happened here though, something
dark and sinister.  Every plant has here has been touched with some sort of
evil poison that has led everything growing here to struggle for complete
dominance over its neighbors.  It is clear from here that the mansion that
stands looking over this vast garden to the southwest is quite deserted, and
that since its desertion other creatures have taken over here.  The garden
continues to the south and east through tangled, overgrown plants of all
varieties, and a small gate leads to a dark path that travels alongside the

   It is clear as one studies the plants here that this was once a spectacular
garden, requiring a number of laborers just to keep up.  Nobody has done
anything with the garden for many years now and it has become overgrown and
strangely twisted.  Whatever curse fell upon the forest outside the walls that
protect the mansion has had double the effect here.  The huge variety of
plants appears to be locked in a sort of slow and deadly combat.  Gradually
destroying each other.  Vines drape their way through bushes and trees
strangling them as they go, and even the small roses and other flowers have
found ways to fight against each other.  The mansion has a beautiful marble
terrace that overlooks the garden to the west, but now some of the vines and
trees have had time to climb their way up to it, beginning their slow assault
on the mansion itself.

twisted together, locked in a slow but deadly mortal combat that is to simple,
and yet to complex to understand.  There is a mysterious darkness here that
even sunlight cannot eliminate.  One would guess that the source of this
sinister darkness is also responsible for the twisted and mutated nature of
the plants and animals in the forest just outside the walls that protect the
mansion.  In fact, it would almost seem that something in this garden may be

difficult, and disconcerting because the bushes seem to move toward anything

between good and evil, for evil has clearly won that battle ages ago, but of a
contest of wills between all the different animals and plants that make this

their way through every possible space in the limbs of the trees and bushes,
sometimes being strangled by the owners of the space they invade, sometimes
doing the strangling themselves.

   When this garden was first planted, small bushes were carefully placed
around larger trees, all spaced so that all the plants received the proper
amount of light.  As time has passed, a strange darkness has overcome the
plants, they all struggle against each other vying for more sunlight or water.
In some cases, it appears that they are simply out to kill each other, tainted
somehow by a madness that has mutated them into something sinister and
malevolent.  A dark pool of water surrounded by dark granite lies to the east
against the eastern wall that encloses the garden.  The water itself swirls
and glows, making the garden and all of its strange plants feel safe by
comparison.

   Tendrils of mist seep in from the dark pool to the east, adding moisture to
the already moist air.  All the once carefully cultivated trees and bushes
battle each other for light, even though there would appear to be enough for
all.  There is a malevolence here that would frighten even the tall marble
statue that stands here, if it were capable of fear.  Nobody has been here for
a very long time, at least nobody that has escaped to tell the tale.  Every
breath of the tainted air here makes one feel a bit more enclosed, a bit more
trapped and unable to escape.  One hopes it is just the feeling of dread
though, dread of the unknown and mysterious and not some strange poison that
floats through the air.

&+gIn an Overgrown Garden&N~
   The feeling of 'wrongness' in this odd garden increases with every step.  A
fountain once stood here but growing vines have wound around it, eventually
squeezing until the very bowl of the fountain has shattered.  One has the
distinct impression that standing in one place too long could lead one to the
same fate.  The plants have acquired some sort of basic intelligence, a
malevolent nature that has led them to attack everything around them.  A dark
pool is to the east, filled with swirling water that glows with a sinister
darkness that makes the garden itself appear safe.

   The trees and bushes here are thicker and taller then those closer to the
mansion to the west.  This is not surprising though, if the tall plants were
closer to the marble terrace at the back of the mansion it would be difficult
to see the smaller flowers and bushes in the garden.  Thick vines have wound
their way through every possible space in the limbs of the trees and bushes,
sometimes being strangled by the owners of the space they invade, sometimes
doing the strangling themselves.  Everything here appears to be in combat with
all the other creatures of the garden.  When there is nothing else around the
plants seem to even turn in on themselves, bearing a hatred so deep that they
must wreak some sort of destruction.

&+gIn an Overgrown Garden&N~
   The garden, and all its sick and twisted plants, comes to an end here.  The
massive granite walls that enclose the mansion and garden stand to the south
and east, and a sinister, glowing pool of water runs along the wall as it
heads north.  Breathing the air alone makes one feel a bit more paranoid,
forces one to ponder what might be hidden behind that nearby bush.  Odorless
fumes seep in from the pool to the north, fumes with a distinctly sinister
quality to them.  It is time to leave, to find a safe place, but there are
none here, even one's traveling companions could be suspect in a place like
this.  Perhaps THEY are also tainted by this darkness.

   Enclosed in granite this pool was clearly made for decoration, and even
bathing use.  It is certain that in some distant past people bathed here
beside the gorgeous garden during the warm summer months.  That past is very

undeniable, even overpowering.  The dark waters continue downward, deep into

&+gIn an Overgrown Garden&N~
   It is clear as one studies the plants here that this was once a spectacular
garden, requiring a number of laborers just to keep up.  Nobody has done
anything with the garden for many years now and it has become overgrown and
strangely twisted.  Whatever curse fell upon the forest outside the walls that
protect the mansion has had double the effect here.  The huge variety of
plants appears to be locked in a sort of slow and deadly combat.  Gradually
destroying each other.  Every shadow here moves with a life of its own, reason
would claim it is just the breeze blowing the limbs of the bushes and trees
around.  But there is a baser instinct that screams in horror with every faint
movement caught in the corner of one's eye.  A dragon would be a more welcome
foe then this fear of the unknown, dread of what may or may not be.  It is
said that imagination can create greater monsters than have ever really
existed.  Ofcourse, what is to say that this garden isn't filled with the
creatures from some malevolent imagination come to life?

   The rough stone walls can barely be made out through the murky water.
Dwarven workmanship so evident in the walls that surround the surface of the
pool is missing here, most assuredly due to the dwarven hatred for water.
There is nothing natural to the murky darkness here, all the fish and other
creatures that reside within the water have become mutated, sinister and
vicious.  Malevolence seems to ride on the very swirls and eddies of water
that make their way through the pool.  The rough stone walls show that this
pool was at least partially natural, that modifications made above to make it
look more artistic didn't stretch down to these unseen depths.

&+LThe End of an Underwater Tunnel&N~
   The tunnel ends at an ugly, rough stone door.  Whatever lives beyond must
be both powerful and dangerous, it appears that the tunnel walls were simply
torn aside by powerful claws.  Several skeletons lie on the rock floor,
covered in the rusted armor that dragged their corpses down to this depth.
Swirls of water containing some sort of air or gas escape through a gap in the
door and spiral upwards making their way to the surface of the pool.  It is
entirely possible that this is the source of the twisted garden up above, it
is also possible that this dark place is a by-product of the same forces that
have cursed the garden.  In either case, death is clearly close at hand.

everything around here with evil.  Fumes of some sort bubble up from some odd
black rocks that are part of the wall to the east, they then spiral together
in small eddies of water that work their way out the door to the west and head
upward to the surface of the pool.

   This well-concealed room contains piles of treasure, some valuable, some
just bright baubles of no value.  A few items are so light that they attempt
to float in the dark water making it difficult to see what things are hidden
here.  A small stone chest has been tucked into the rock in the southern
corner, it is locked though and the lock looks quite complex.  Though well-
hidden and cared for, there really appears to be very little here that is of
great value, or at least enough value to merit hauling it out.

   Though not the most elegant of stones, this granite has seen far better
workmanship then the marble in many castles.  It has been cut and polished so
that the individual stones fit so closely together that they need no mortar.
The dark stone gleams with small bits of quartz, making it seem almost alive.
Continuing upward toward the entrance to a large mansion and downward to an
overgrown courtyard, this wide stone stairway is clearly designed to present
an understated elegance.  Rather than drawing attention to the mansion it
leads up to, it causes the eye to drift back toward the courtyard which must
once have been a far prettier site than it is now.

welcoming words, there are protective niches on each side of the double doors
for guards to stand watch.  Arrow slits in the walls higher above and to the
sides appear to be more for threats then actual use for large windows, now
broken, have been set on either side of the doorway.  An elegant, though
understated, granite stairway leads down into what must once have been a
beautiful courtyard.

   The black marble of the double doors that lead into the mansion have been
covered with a creamy wood veneer on their inside surface to keep the foyer
from becoming dark during the day.  A small sitting room with a large window
is off to the south and a long hallway continues off to the west.  A winding
staircase spirals upward from this point to the second level of the house.
Planters containing dirt and shriveled plants have been set on numerous stands
and niches throughout the entryway, and the hallway that extends to the west.
When they were properly cared for they were undoubtedly a tasteful addition to
the otherwise plain decor.

south lead into other rooms in the mansion.  Though the door to the north has
no defining markings, the door to the south has the simple inlayed design of a
book in its center.  The hallway continues to the east and west.

magnificent garden.  In a time where the garden was properly cared for this
room and its view would have been truely magificent.  However, the garden is

forest that encloses the mansion grounds.  Carefully constructed parquet

was used for work rather than holding meetings of any sort, the only chair in
the room is the leather chair that stands behind the desk.  Despite the fact
the room isn't for show, it is elegantly and tastefully adorned, with comfort
being the most important factor in its decoration.

   One would guess that this room was once quite well adorned, looters have
made their way in though and nothing of value remains.  What couldn't be
stolen has been completely demolished.  In fact, the room looks as though a
lengthy battle of some sort has been carried out here, a battle that the
furniture has lost.  Great enough force was used to destroy the bed that
wooden splinters from it have sprung up from the floor to impale the once
gorgeous wooden paneling.  The dresser also lies in shambles, its marble top
and small mirror lie broken on top of the shattered wood.  Who or whatever did
this not only had great strength but they must also have been consumed by a
great rage.

creamy brown wood stands beneath a window in the northern wall.  The window is
just high enough to peer over the wall that encloses the mansion and its
gardens.  Beyond the wall a carpet of thorny trees can be seen stretching off
into the distance.  The forest has a twisted darkness to it, a darkness that
seems to hang in the air in the mansion as well.  A beautifully carved door

of flowers and small bushes growing in the room, fed by the light above and
the water from the fountain.  When water ceased flowing in the fountain, the
plants eventually died, leaving only their dried remains behind.  An open spot
in the floor suggests something of value may once have stood there, something
that has since found its way to another place.  An arched doorway leads to a
wide hallway to the north.

&+WThe Ballroom&N~
   This vast room extends almost the entire width of the mansion and is well
lit both by magically enchanted crystal chandeliers and by the fact that the
eastern wall is almost entirely made of windows.  Looking out over a marble
terrace and the vast garden behind the mansion, the windows add a grandness to
the room that was clearly thought about when the room was initially designed.
Like many things owned by the extremely wealthy, this room is designed for
both comfort and a demonstration of wealth.  In a time where the garden was
properly cared for this room and its view would have been truely magificent.
However, the garden is overgrown now, and even has an odd, ominous aspect to
it that matches the forest that encloses the mansion grounds.  Carefully
constructed parquet floors extend to the north where there is a glass door
leading out to the marble terrace

&+yAn Elegant Dining Area&N~
   The light here is a bit more muted then in the ballroom that continues to
the north.  Either the chandelier here has lost a bit of its magic, or it was
designed to have a little less light.  A long dining table extends across the
room surrounded by at least three dozen chairs.  Whatever place settings may
have been left on the table were taken ages ago, not even condiment containers
have been left behind.  A plain panel in the wall to the west is clearly the
servant's door into the kitchen, through which the meals were once brought.
Large windows in the wall to the east show a clear view of a marble terrace
and the magificent garden it overlooks.  The garden is now overgrown and
twisted, bearing a dark and ominous taint to it similar to the forest that
surrounds the mansion grounds.

   Shelves and carts line the walls here, where they once held the plates and
serving utensils for the dining room that lies beyond the door to the east.
Everything of value was stripped from the shelves and carts a long time ago.
Even the cupboards that line the western wall have been stripped of any edible
food.  As the kitchen continues to the south a massive stove and oven can be
seen.

&+WAlongside a Massive Stove&N~
   A massive stove, capable of cooking enough food for almost a hundred people
at once, lines the southern wall.  Long, thin vents in the wall above the
stove were clearly designed to vent some of the heat and odors out of the
kitchen to avoid any untoward aromas leaking into the dining room.  This
kitchen was designed to serve far more people then this mansion could really
hold, a typical waste of money among the very wealthy.  A narrow liquor room
is to the east and the kitchen continues to the north.

&+yA Narrow Liquor Storage Room&N~
   A small bench along the extensive wine racks shows that this room was
clearly used in the creation of many different drinks as well as in the simple
pouring and serving of ale and wine.  The empty bottles that lie around the
room show that only the most expensive and exquisite wines and other drinks
were served here.  Casks lined up against the southern wall have clearly been
empty for many years, but the markings on them reveal ancient vintages that
are still talked about today.  There is a small door in the wall to the east
that has clearly been designed to be as unnoticeable as possible, and the main
kitchen stove is to the west.

&+WA Marble Terrace&N~
   One of the main features of the mansion would appear to be its grounds.
The garden behind the mansion was certainly quite spectacular during the time
it was well-maintained, now though it has a dark and twisted nature to it.
Colorful flowers still dot the bushes and trees that spread out to the east,
but the plants appear to be growing completely wild now, attacking anything
and everything they run into.  Certain trees and long vines have even reached
the marble balustrade that runs along the edge of the terrace to the east.
The terrace continues to the north, giving a wide view of the once beautiful
garden.

&+WA Marble Terrace&N~
   Even though the garden below is dark and twisted, the beauty it once had is
easy to determine.  This terrace must have entertained many people with its
clear overview of the intricate garden below, giving a clear demonstration of
its owner's wealth.  Marble benches have been set along the balustrade to the
east to provide a clear, relaxing view of the garden.  Nothing about the
garden brings any feelings of relaxation now, it has become overgrown, and
twisted by some strange darkness that has consumed every creature within it.

   Vines have climbed up the beautiful marble stairway that leads down into
the garden, in preparation for a slow takeover of the terrace.  A beautiful
glass door leads into a large ballroom to the west, a room that is still well-
lit.  Massive glass windows run along the mansion allowing a view of this
terrace and the garden to the east.  The garden must once have been the center
of conversation here, and certainly a great cost to its owner, yet now it has
become overgrown and tainted with an ugliness that is not so much seen as
felt.

   The raised vantage point of the terrace gives a clear view of the once
beautiful garden below.  All the plants have become tainted somehow, gaining
an ugly darkness that one senses in some intangible manner.  It still looks
quite beautiful, though overgrown, yet it bears an ominous nature that is
difficult to fathom.  The precious white marble that has been used to create
the smooth flooring here has also been used to create the intricate
trelliswork of the balustrade that prevents any from tumbling off the terrace
into the garden below.  The stonework here was done with taste, and skill,
giving a firm but quiet impression of extreme wealth.

&+yOn a Spiral Staircase&N~
   Turning as it climbs upward, this staircase bears many empty niches that
must once have contained beautiful vases or statues.  The barren niches have
layers of dust that suggest nothing has occupied those spots for many years.
A sturdy rail bearing carved vines and flowers runs along the wall the
stairway continues both up and down.  Though not really of great length, it
seems that great care went into the design of the staircase and its small
niches.  Clearly, the staircase was meant to be artistic as well as
functional.

&+yA Short Hallway&N~
   Perhaps this hallway was once elegantly adorned, now though, it is quite
plain.  The most distictive features in the hallway are the ornate doors that
can be seen evenly spaced along its walls.  All of the doors have been left
closed, some even appear to be locked.  Where there are no doors there are
paneled niches for vases and statues, or clear areas of paneling that must
once have held pictures or tapestries.  A single small window to the west
gives a view of the front courtyard and allows a small amount of light into
this otherwise dark hallway.  An ornate door is to the south and the hallway
continues east.  A narrow stairway spirals downward from here to the first
floor of the mansion.

   Dark and windowless, this unadorned room was clearly used to store many of

been stored here, from clothing for small boys and girls to elegant gowns and
suits as well as old vases and statues that must once have been on display.
Time has done its job on most everything here, and rats or mice have helped
destroy the rest.  An elegant door leads back out of the room to the north.

overlooked, but nothing remains in this part of the hallway to even bother
searching.  The hallway continues to the east and west where more ornate doors

&+BA Boy's Room&N~
   Numerous toy swords lie around in a state of complete disarray, marking
this as a young boy's room.  A magnificent tapestry on the eastern wall
depicts the battle between a clan of dwarves and a large black dragon.  Most
of the details of the tapestry focus on the dragon and its many wounds, as if
the dragon is considered the hero of the portrait rather than the valiant
dwarves that are battling it.  A wide dresser stands beneath a window in the
northern wall and a large bed can be seen further to the west as the bedroom
continues.

   Despite its large size, the sheets and blankets that cover the bed clearly

lie in a heap on the matching sheets that cover the bed.  Windows in the
northern and eastern wall look out over the forest and courtyard,
respectively.  A ceremonial long sword has been hung in its scabbard from one
of the bedposts, showing that the boy that once lived here was at least old
enough to handle such an item without hurting himself.

A deep, dark brown dresser stands along the western wall, topped by several
elegant vases that contain the dried up remains of some flowers.  The
decorations here have a decidedly feminine touch, with the decaying remains of
a silk gown hanging from a rack in the center of the room it is easy to guess
that a young woman once lived here.

marble top of the vanity, immediately in front of the mirror that tops it.
Paintings of different flower arrangements and groups of fruit add color to
the plain panel walls and a massive vase in the northeastern corner contains a
dead plant of some sort.  A large window looks out over a vast forest to the
south, but the forest has little in the way of attractive detail, it looks
more like a dark green carpet then anything else.

   Small niches along the panel walls here show that they were once decorated

some light into the room.  A massive, ornate door stands to the west sporting
a complex and expensive lock.  Numerous scratches and bruises in the door and
the wood paneling to the north and south show that someone, or something, has
tried to enter the room beyond without any success.

   A massive steel vault fills almost the entire room.  This is where the Lord

years of standing here alone, it is clear that the vault has never been
opened.  It is also clear however, that the lock is quite complex and would
require a key that is nowhere to be found.  Whatever the vault contains will
likely stay there until a key can be found, or perhaps made by a skilled
craftsman.

draped so that nobody can see in through it.  On top of both dressers a number
of tiny ivory statues can be seen, all of them so intricately carved that they
are clearly worth a fortune.

mansion's gardens.  Every single decoration in the room appears to have been
carefully considered, statues and vases have matching themes whose colors
match well with the tapestries and paintings hanging on the walls.  Not only
did the decorator have an eye for good art, they also had an eye for
displaying it to its greatest advantage.  If the missing decorations in the
barren hallways of the mansion were this fine, then this would truely have
been a marvelous place to live.

   Smooth marble steps have been cloaked by slow growing vines that are
beginning to creep up from the garden below.  Figures have been carved into
the railing on each side of the stairway, but these too are cloaked in vines.
The plants bear a strange darkness to them.  It is as if they have required
feelings, or at least a feeling, hate.  All the different plants of the garden
below are locked in some strange slow-motion struggle for dominance that
appears to be driven by hatred and rage.  There is an eerie silence to the
garden that is pierced only occasionally by a tortured scream.  Not even the
calls of crickets or other insects can be heard echoing up from below.
