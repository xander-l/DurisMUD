The Nexus of the Web~
   The many skeins of the web come together here. In this center of the
great bottomless cavern of arachdrathos the spider Aracnon spun her web. It
is here she lairs, and here she guards the gateway to the web of the Demoness
Lolth. The wind howls in shrill from above, and the web here trembles under
the feet of a thousand demons.

Under the Shadow of Sorcery~
   The web here draws close to the tower of high sorcery, that of house
Olipth. The powerful magics incanted in this glorious tower radiate intensely
along the skeins of the web, dancing in graceful arcs along the heavily
reconstructed webwalk, and jumping to swirl along the sides of the tower.

A Radial Skein~
   The thick silk strand spun by the great spider Arachdra climbs away from
house Zochra towards the Llzazan Ghetto. Some evidence of reconstruction is
readily apparent as the drow of the Jewel of the Underworld finally decided
to repair the damage done to this precious web by the sack on house Llzazan.

Below House Ilith~
   The massive expanse of House Ilith spreads across the horizon of the web
above. Below the arch of House Zarbonesti straddles the web, and rises
high above eye level even at this high rim of the web. The web itself here
has been reinforced and reconstructed by the silk of cavefishers into a grand
webwalk.

the bone tower, not for its appearance, which is entirely of the common black
basalt veined with durithalite, but for the activities of the house, that of
high necromancy in the drow realms. Above the skein stretches towards the

The Back Door~
   The end of this skein of web just above marks the back door of
Arachdrathos as the thick web reaches a small cave at the edge of the
great cavern of Arachdrathos. Below, the web stretches off across the
cavern, cradling the noble houses of Arachdrathos in its grasp.

   House Zochra, the bone tower, and tower of High Necromancy erupts from
the web below. It climbs high overhead though, stretching well into the void
that dominates the skies over Arachdrathos. A screaming wind rips in from

The End of a Skein~
   Here the skein that supports this section of the web from edge to center
finds its anchoring point on the wind-polished cavern wall. It is anchored
to nothing more than a relatively small fissure in the wall which sinks into
the cliff face less than three feet. Both above and below this ripple in the
surface of the cave, the wall is sheer as it climbs and descends into
oblivion.

By climbing down the webwalk extending from the cliff edge, one can access
the web itself and walk out to one of the many great spires of rock
mysteriously captured by the web. To the east, the sigil of House Zarbonesti

&+rA Sandy Cavern&N~
   A thick black sand coats the floor of the cavern here. It is very loose
and very deep, allowing one to sink above their knees with each footfall. The
sand is obviously of black basalt, but what broke this rock into such a fine
powder here is not readily apparent.

On a Ledge~
   The Ledge here ends abruptly as it is anchored to the webwalk above house
Zochra. Far below the web of the City of Arachdrathos stretches across the
cavern. Supported on this great web are six unusual rock formations, all of
which have been converted into the noble's houses of Arachdrathos.

On a Ledge~
   The Ledge ends abruptly to the south as signs of a huge blast have severed
the rock from the cliff face. Looking over the edge, with the exception of
the massive void expanding to oblivion, ther eis only a meager webwalk
constructed across this gap in the ledge.

The Webwalk~
   This bridge of silk crosses a gap that was blasted in the rock on the side
of the great cavern of Arachdrathos. It sways violently under the strong wind
from above, and pitches dangerously, attempting to throw off anybody crossing
it.

The Webwalk~
   Constructed with the help of cave fishers, the drow use these unique
structures to supplement the natural web of the great city Arachdrathos, or
in this case as simple bridges to connect rock outcroppings into roads. The
cavern wall here is heavily blackened, as if an amazing force has decimated
the cavern wall in this region.

The Webwalk of the Blasted Wall~
   The drow have enslaved cave fishers here and used them to construct a
bridge of silk across a blasted section of cavern wall from here to the
north. To the east, the webwalk anchors to the mouth of the Llzazan ghetto.
The wall of the chasm of the city of spiders and Jewel of the Underworld has
been heavily balsted by a magnificent force. Even more magnificent here is
the awesome void that stretches out above and below the cavern. From this
void above howls a wind that sends the mighty web of the city bowing under
its force and entire houses of nobles standing proud upon the web a swaying.

The Back Door Wilderness~
   The cavern here ends abruptly at a great chasm, housing the city of
Arachdrathos. A strong wind can be heard howling in from above,
occasionally blasting through this side cavern. Below, a skein of the great
web of Arachdrathos stretches across the cavern to join the main web of the
city and the noble houses scattered throughout it. To the north a strange
forest of mushroom stalks chokes off a small path through this cavern.

A Trail in the Wilderness~
   The mushroom trees and bushes have choked off a very tight and twisted
path through the wilderness here. Small fungus throrns have grown on some
of the more twisted fungus bushes, threatening to rip at flesh and clothing.
Spiny spore balls litter the wilderness floor making footing treacherous
indeed.

A Change in the Wilderness.~
   It is unclear if the dunes give way to forst or if the forst is giving way
to dunes here, but anyway it is viewed, the mushroom forest is sporting a
very loose and granular basalt sand floor that begins to overtake the fungus
bushes. The sand is fine enough and soft enough that it is easy for ones
footsteps to become mired as they trek through these dunes.

&+LThe Arachdrathan Dunes&N~
   Rich piles of basalt sand fill the cavern here, soft and powdery, this
sand forms quickly around the boots of anybody walking through it, allowing
these people to sink into the soft dunes well past the knee. The cavern
ceiling is fairly low here, making upright walking difficult.

&+LA Low Cave Ceiling over the Arachdrathan Dunes&N~
   Named after the nearby city of spiders and jewel of the underworld, these
dunes are about as hospitable to a drow as the city of Arachdrathos is to a
human. The ceiling is so low that one must crawl through the dunes here,
making breating very difficult as one sinks through the soft black basalt
sand. The cave continues to the South and West.

blinding to behold. A small yellow post it note is attached to the north
wall of the room. A huge hole has been blasted in the west wall.
