&+yA Rocky Trail~
   This rocky trail cuts through a small wooded area towards the
center of the valley where a fairly nice settlement has been
established this far away from the powerful kingdoms of Tharnadia.
There are many sounds in the area, including those of people hard
at work and children playing. The village can be seen just off
to the north here.

&+yOutside Some Flimsy Wooden Gates~
  This seems to be where the town starts, where these poorly
constructed gates stand approximately fifteen feet high. The gates
are made out of only timber, and not the best timber at that.
The mountains seem to have made this area a little bit colder
than the rest of the area. There is much snowfall during the year,
however, the peasants seem to have been able to grow quit a
plentiful crop.

&+yInside The Tall Wooden Gates~
  Inside these gates opens a vast village that flourishes from
many different kinds of crops. There are several people walking
around the city pulling crates of fresh vegetables and fruits
along with them. From this point of view, the gates look at tiny
bit more sturdy. The wood used to make these gates was probably cut
down from one of the local forest to the valley, and seems to be
of a very sturdy condition.  Small engravings have been engraved
upon the gate during the time it was built.

&+YA Pleasant Village Path~
  This path runs through the farming lands of the town, and is
nothing more than a dirt road where wagon trails have been worn
into the ground. The gates of the small village are short ways
off to the south, and there are farm lands all around.

seems to glow with light. The whole cave is extremely huge, and smooth,
with a small pile of frosty leaves as what looks like a bed in the far
corner of the cave.

Mid Air~
   This area is nothing but open air, as it goes up the mountain side.
There are beautiful skies all around, and huge mountains to the north
and to the east. From this view point, a small band of evils can be
seen near the Faang Pass.

  This path roams through the fields here with farm houses all around,
and the main part of town is still a ways off in the distance. The
gates of the village are a ways back to the south, and a huge mountain
at the edge of the valley rises in the sky over towards the east.

&+WA Holy Shrine&n~
   The mountain comes to a climax here where the cloud giants of
this mountain have set up a holy shrine to their god.  Several
cloud giants can be seen praying and offering sacrifices on a
daily base.  The whole area seems to be filled with a healing
power.  When one of the villagers is attacked or killed, they
come up here to be blessed.

   The misty shaft opens up to the top of the cloudy
mountain here.  This is the first of a series of mountains
that stretch on up into the sky further and further.  To
the north is a pathway along the peaks of the mountain. The
path to the north is cloudy and visibility is slightly
limited.  The sounds of giants can be heard.

   The path continues along the mountain top here.
This area is right in the cloud line and it is very
difficult to see very far down the path.  Every now
and then, the clouds open up for a moment allowing
more of the path to be visible.  The area is worn
very deep from what looks like cloud giant tracks.

&+LThe Grand Foyer of &+CCastle Selanis&n~
  This foyer is the grand entry way to the great
Castle Selanis.  This castle appears to be incredibly
old, having sat in these mountains and witnessed
many civilizations rise and fall in the surrounding
areas.  The stone of the castle has been carved
directly out of the mountain peak.  The surrounding
clouds around the castle seep in through windows
and fill the rooms with a fine mist.

small cave in the mountain that has been carved out
by the cloud giants when they created their castle.
The rock of the mountain appears very malleable
under the right amount of pressure, which the cloud
giants can supply.  The quarters have been nicely
decorated with a bed, desk, and book shelf.

  This room serves as guest quarters for those
visiting Castle Selinas.  Essentially this is a
small cave in the mountain that has been carved out
by the cloud giants when they created their castle.
The rock of the mountain appears very malleable
under the right amount of pressure, which the cloud
giants can supply.  The quarters have been nicely
decorated with a bed, desk, and book shelf.
