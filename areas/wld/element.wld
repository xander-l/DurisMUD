&+GThe Entrance to the Vale&n~
   The path here comes around an outcropping of stone; to the south a
large, wide vale is revealed.  The vale is absolutely awash with colors;
there are a mind-boggling assortment of trees in the vale, mostly growing
here or there with no rhyme or reason, except for glades spotted here or
there that consist of similar types of trees.  For the most part the trees
are impassable, but some sort of path seems to wind through the vale.

&+yWinding path through the &+RElemental&+G Glades&n~
   This is not so much a path as it is the only passable way through the
dense trees.  Despite the density of the trees, the wood is still light for
the most part; sunlight or moonlight is still free to come in from the
heavens, shining light on the wildly assorted trees that line the path.  A
dizzying array of tree species surround the path, and there seems to be a
slight humming in the air.

&+yWinding Path Through the &+RElemental&+G Glades&n~
   This is not so much a path as it is the only passable way through the
dense trees.  Despite the density of the trees, the wood is still light for
the most part; sunlight or moonlight is still free to come in from the
heavens, shining light on the wildly assorted trees that line the path.  A
dizzying array of tree species surround the path, and there seems to be a

   The tall slender trees that make up this grove fill the air with a semi-
sweet smell.  Their branches are thin and do not have many leaves on them;
the ground is covered with a thin layer of the fallen leaves, which release
a clean smell into the air.  Breathing in the fragrance of the trees is
reputed to open one's sinuses, but who knows?

&+cOpen Air~
   In all directions there is nothing but wide open space, except to the
east, where some sort of tower hangs in the air.  It is possible to see an
almost unlimited distance down, but there is nothing there.  Barely
detectable streams of rushing air prohibit travel in certain directions,
since entering the jet stream would blow one away.  Literally.

&+cEntrance to the Tower in the Air&n~
   The walls of this structure are made of pumice, a porous rock that
floats on water.  It must have been magically enhanced, however, to manage
to float in the air.  There is no ground, but a few plants float around in
this enclosed area, their roots drawing nutrients from the air.  There is a
way to climb into the tower itself to the southeast.
