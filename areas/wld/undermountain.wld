&+LLight pours in from the busy inn fifty feet above. To the south, a damp&N
&+Lpassageway begins into the heart of the dark dungeon as the floors change&N
&+Lfrom a sandy texture to hard stone. A message has been scrawled out in&N

A Hidden Room~
   This is a large room hidden within the main passage. Curiously the room
seems to have wooden walls, but upon closer inspection, this is found to be
untrue. The walls are in fact stone, but the light source creates an odd
optical illusion making it appear to be wood. The floors are damp and in
several places are standing puddles of water. Apparently something has been
sleeping here among the shadows.

   &+LThis large room is fairly nondescript with the exception of massive vents&N
&+Lleading to the surface. The ceiling is about twenty feet high, and contains&N
&+Lseven vents which probably lead to various parts of the mountains or caves.&N
&+LThey give off an enormous amount of steam and heat. The purpose of these vents&N
&+Lis uncertain, as there seems to be no practical use in Verzanan for something&N

   Along both the northern and southern walls in this long hallway, are rows
and rows of shiny mirrors. Each mirror is ten feet wide and each is separated
by a section of wall which is also ten feet wide. The room's lofty ceilings
seem covered in ancient cobwebs. To the east there is a staircase which
disappears down into the darkness. To the south a passage begins and continues
deeper into the dungeon. To the north a short corridor leads to an adjoining

&+Lreinforced by thick steel bars. To the east is a sliding, black ebony door with&N
&+Lfingerholes instead of a door handle. A peculiar knocking sound can be heard&N

A Knight's Tomb~
   In this room there is a human skeleton lying in the northwestern corner.
There is a small epitaph inscribed upon the wall above the skeleton. Scattered
about the floor are small droppings of some sort, which smells very similar to
bat guano. In the southwestern corner of the room, a small nest has been made
from an old black leather backpack and various other materials. To the north
there is a steel-reinforced oak door. There are two open exits to the east and
south.

The Chamber of Death~
   This is a large room which connects four passageways in the dungeon. The
ceilings rise to about twenty feet with a plain stone pillar as support in
the center of the room. The walls appear to have held tapestries or paintings
at one time, but are now bare and nondescript. The cold tile floor is covered
in puddles of still wet blood. Apparently there was a recent battle here as the
smell of sulfur and burned flesh lingers in the air. There are open exits
leading in all directions.

bite anyone who enters the room. To the north the passage leads into a long

&+RThe Clan Viper Sleeping Area&N~
   &+cThis was the sleeping area for the Clan Viper Goblin Raiders before they&N
&+cwere forced to go into hiding. There are about ten small cots lined neatly in&N
&+crows along the walls and each bedframe appears to be coated with the magical&N
&+ceverbright to prevent rusting and the need for cleaning. The Raiders were&N
&+cobviously very well organized and highly trained to have been capable of&N
&+csupplying equipment of this sort. There are a few showers in one corner of the&N
&+croom as well as wash basins. The water supply appears to have been magically&N
&+csupplied for the Clan members, but the magic appears to have run out, as none&N
&+cof the showers or sinks will supply water any longer. It seems new residents&N
&+chave moved in since the Clan abandoned this outpost.&N

&+ROld Clan Viper Raiding Post&N~
   &+cThis is what used to be a central ambush point for the once dreaded Clan&N
&+cViper Goblin Raiders. Now the Clan has been either forced into hiding or&N
&+ckilled. This room contains several old benches and a large table. This was&N
&+cprobably the planning room and central meeting point for the raiders. From&N
&+cthe looks of things, the Clan was highly organized and well trained, but after&N
&+cword of their success spread throughtout the dungeon and the surface, they were&N
&+cwiped out one by one. Rumor has it that some members of the Clan still remain&N
&+cin deeper parts of the Dungeon and under new leadership. There is a corridor&N
&+cleading north and an adjacent room is to the east.&N

&+GAn Underground Garden&N~
   &+cThis room is notably filled with several species of plantlife and fungi. The&N
&+cfoliage grows wild it seems through massive cracks in the walls and floors.&N
&+cThe wild plants seem to sway to a silent harmony which only the plants can&N
&+csense. The room is large and spacious, with its ceiling extending well over&N
&+cthirty feet. Some of the more prodigious plants have risen high to the ceiling&N
&+cand beyond. The wondrous plants seem to shy away from light and cringe when&N
&+cthe serenity of their home is disturbed by both intruders and noises. Several&N

&+LA Towering Room&N~
   &+yThis room rises to almost seventy foot above the floor. The walls are&N
&+yformed from layered brick and mortar, and the floors are created from tiled&N
&+yflagstone blocks. Several of the flagstone blocks have been lifted out of the&N
&+yground to reveal a small cavity in the floor. The cavity appears to be empty.&N
&+yAcross the high ceiling above, a sprawling spider web formed of thick strands&N
&+yforms eerie shadows upon the floor from some undetermined light source on the&N
&+yceiling. There are stone doors leading to the north, south, and east.&N

&+RA Circular Room&N~
   &+LThis room is covered in protective glyphs and wards which were probably used&N
&+Lfor some unholy ritual. The room is however, not used to summon demons or&N
&+Lanimate the dead any longer. Now the room is a treasure cache of sorts. The&N
&+Lwalls of the room are painted black and the symbols upon the wall are in&N
&+Lblood red. A strange musky smell is all around the room. The smell is similar&N
&+Lto that of a large pig, but has a peculiar sharpness, which the domestic pig&N
&+Ldoes not have. There is a stone door to the south.&N

&+BA Peculiar Alcove&N~
   &+LWithin this strange alcove is an intricate throne, which has been carved&N
&+Lout of a single piece of stone. The throne is covered with odd patterns and&N
&+Lancient scripts from a long forgotten language. Above the throne, separated&N
&+Lbones from a long dead human float in midair. The skull of the human&N
&+Lcontinuously follows anyone within the room, keeping an eerie watch over the&N
&+Lcorridor. Firmly planted in front of the throne are the two feet of the&N
&+Lskeleton, which are the only intact parts remaining. There is a solid oak&N
&+Ldoor, which leads to the north, and to the south, a new passageway begins.&N

&+mthe walls in this room are tapestries which could only have come from the&N
&+mdarkest of Underground cities. The tapestries show a magnificient city, the&N
&+mlikes of which few surface dwellers have ever seen. The main point of interest&N
&+mwithin the city is the port, which looks as if it services some vast&N
&+munderground sea. Other tapestries show majestic drow cities far beneath the&N
&+mSpine of the World and other cities which are so alien in appearance, they can&N
&+monly be fantasy. The only exit is a broad mithral door to the north.&N

&+Ysymbols of power and prestige as well as meticulous carvings of holy symbols&N

   This is a rather large room, which bears literally thousands of images
and writings. The room apparently catalogues various parts of the Prime
Material plane. One such drawing depicts severel spheres within larger
spheres, all of which is bound and connected by a massive globulous
region, which apparently has no boundaries. Other pictures show individual
spheres and various blue and green regions upon each sphere. To the north
is a short flight of stairs leading upwards, and to the south is a

   &+cWithin this strange room are paintings and carvings depicting the wondrous&N
&+cElemental Plane of Earth. The entire room is painted in a rusty dark brown&N

&+ca group of earth elementals engaged in combat against dark-skinned elven&N

&+LA Mysterious Study&N~
   &+yThis ancient room looks to have been a study for someone or something at one&N
&+ytime. The room contains several large empty bookcases along all four walls,&N
&+ywhich rise to almost the full fifteen foot height of the room. The floor is&N
&+ysolid stone, and is highly polished. A massive oak desk, which continues to&N
&+yshine from its frequent polishing, lies in front of the northern wall and faces&N
&+yto the south. A high-backed leather chair, which looks to be very comfortable&N
&+yrests behind the massive desk. One wonders if the owner of this study truly has&N
&+yabandoned this place of privacy. The only exit is a barely noticeable door to&N
&+ythe west.&N

&+ywhich were used to furnish the many empty rooms of the dungeon. Upon the tables&N
&+yare large saws, and great clamps which are now rusted and beyond use, as well&N
&+yas rotted wood, and piles of dusty scrap metal. Upon one table are the remains&N

&+rthe burial place of the infamous House Redstorm, a notable organized crime&N
&+rgroup which lost prestige over three hundred years ago. There are seven coffins&N
&+rwhich look to have been very intricately decorated at one time, but all of&N
&+rthese coffins are now broken open, the corpses are gone, and any treasures&N
&+rwhich might have been present are now gone. Each coffin has a name carved on&N

&+rhouse. Passageway begin to the east and down a short flight of stairs to the&N

&+rtombs for the old organized crime group known as House Redstorm. The family&N

&+rrespected within the City of Splendors. A worn statue of Shanolin Redstorm,&N
&+rthe head of House Redstorm, sits in the center of the wide passageway, facing&N
&+reast. The statue depicts a male human clothed in full battlegear. Above the&N
&+rstatue is a message which appears to have been written in midair. The glowing&N

&+rlies in the center of the room is crafted entirely from the bones of several&N
&+rhumans, possibly those which crossed Shanolin during his reign in Verzanan.&N
&+rThe chamber is cold, and a feeling of death surrounds all which enter this&N
&+rroom. Upon all the walls are magnificient paintings, depicting the enormous&N
&+rwealth and power of the once reknown family. Upon closer inspection, these&N
&+rpaintings are all blood based, causing an added sense of the sheer evil&N
&+rof the House Redstorm. The only exit is a barely noticeable stone door to the&N

&+YThe Throne Guard Room~
   &+LWithin this impressive room is a small dais which rises to a magnificient&N
&+Lthrone. The throne is carved from a single piece of stone and thousands of&N
&+Lchiseled runes have been carved upon its surface. The throne is immaculate&N
&+Lin condition and appears to be rarely used if ever. Red carpet with fine&N
&+Lgolden silk trimming leads up to the throne from the eastern exit. To the&N
&+Lsouth is a battered iron door.&N

   &+yThis magnificient room was apparently the sleeping chambers of some wealthy&N
&+ynobleman. The walls bear gorgeous tapestries from far away lands and the floor&N
&+yis covered with an expensive looking rug. Along the southern wall is a high-&N
&+ybacked four-poster bed with satin sheets and drapes. A massive dresser sits&N
&+ynear the bed as well. The room does not appear to have be used recently, as&N
&+ythe bed is cold and the sheets have been made. The only exit is a battered &N

&+WA Snowcovered Forest~
   &+cThe forest all around depicts a scene of solitide and serenity. Both the
&+cground and the evergreen trees are covered with snow. The silence is deafening
&+cas there are no birds, nor insects, nor animals about. In several places, the
&+cpathway through the trees is obscured by fallen pine trees and thick foliage.
&+cTo the south and west are clear passageways through the forest.

&+WA Passageway&N~
   &+LThe damp stone walls catch the light and sparkle giving the illusion that&N
&+Lthey contain valuable ores. While moving among the corridors, one gets a&N
&+Lstrange uncomfortable sensation of wonder and fear. Constant awareness seems&N
&+Lto be the only ally in these deep, murky tunnels. The passage continues to&N
&+Lthe west at the beginning of a long dark stone staircase. To the east is a&N
&+Lbarely noticeable door.&N

&+mPrison of the &+LDamned&n~
&+m   This is a small prison cell for the drow priestess to hold her victims until they
&+mcan be properly sacrificed to the dark, Lloth.  There are no furnishings within the room
&+mand the only real difference from a bare room is the stench of dying, pathetic things.
&+mThe only exit is back up through the grate.&n
