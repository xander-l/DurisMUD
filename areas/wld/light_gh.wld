&=lLEnt&=lwran&+Wce to th&=lwe Li&+Lght~
&=lWThis room was carved out a solid piece of marble over fifty feet in height.
&=lWThe walls are so clean they reflect your image almost perfectly as you gaze
&=lWinto them.  A few beams of light shine through the upper entrance here, they
&=lWilluminate the room entirely, leaving no shadows and practically blinding
&=lWall who wander into the room.

&=lwperhaps not the brightest in the land.  The walls were painted and etched
&=lwin the style of &+YUgta's &=lwmany huts and paths.  Unfortunately the walls were done

&=lWRoom of &+CHuman &+Wlore~
This room is garnered with no decorations, the walls are baren and crafted out
of  cheap pine wood  found near Tharnadia.  The only dust to be  found in the
building is found in this room which is  obviously not very well kept.  There
are no  scenes of battles on the  walls, no paintings garner the room.  It is
dull and plain.

&=lLThis is the only room left darkened in the entire structure. It is littered
&=lLwith cots and blankets of all sizes so that it remains  a comfortable place
&=lLto rest one's head for  the night.  No sound seems to enter into  this room
&=lLfrom  the rest of the  building making  it the  perfect place for quiet and
&=lLpeaceful rest.

to be
