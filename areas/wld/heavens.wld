&+LThe &+WSan&+wctu&+Lary of &+WDrannak&+L, &+rHarbinger&+L of &+WSal&+wvat&+Lion&n~
As you stand in this room, you are overcome with a feeling of &+Wpeace &nand &+rsecurity&n.
Mystical &+Cmists&n dart throughout the room creating a slight &+ch&+Caz&+ce&n. A &+ccr&+Cystal&n clear
waterfall softly splashes against smooth &+Lobsidian &nrocks which form this room. A &+Yheavenly&n
light casts &+ysoft&n rays throughout the room, feeling your body with &+ywarmth &nas they caress
your skin.

Because I am hard you will not like me. But the more you hate me the more you

look down on niggers, kikes, wops or greasers. Here you are all equally

&+Lis visible, if not somewhat distorted.  Though trees and grasses exist only
&+Lscant inches from what your eyes can see, they are clouded in haze and you are
&+Lunable to interact with them.  Sound is somewhat muted here, but is not hindered
&+Lby the fact that you are on an entirely different Plane of existence.  The sound
&+Lof birds in a blurry tree not far off are fairly clear to the ear.  The clouds of
&+Limmaterial substance that persist here roil and combine in a way that obscures

&+c   This room has been subtly taken over by the devious powers of Jera.
&+cThe walls are covered with mementos of her various incarnations, includ-
&+cing a&N &+YLyre of the Svalich Minotaur&+c, a simulacrum of the three-pronged
&+Wt&+Co&+Wt&+Ce&+Wm&N &+cof the&N &+WNaga Queen&+c, as well as a small emblem denoting devotions
&+cto the might of&N &+mLolth&+c.  Each item has been placed with care, and are
&+clovingly maintained.  A desk in the corner has been covered with reams of
&+cparchment and paper, maps and drawings of the various towns within the
&+clands are scattered everywhere as well as the descriptions of a myriad
&+cdifferent items to be found around the realms.&N

Your Own Personal Hell, With Seventeen Little Doorknobs In The Floor~
   Yep. You feel very alive, and very much in pain and otherwise
uncomfortable. You are flooded with constant sensation through your
every nerve. The source is indeterminate, as your senses do not agree.
It could be fire, raging torrents of water, chain saws and other machinery.
The exact reason in unimportant, as the results greatly out shadow anything
else. Your mind is so overwhelmed that you only have rudimentary control
over your muscles, with every movement strained and severely shaking. Balance
is a cruel memory from the past, as you tumble over, and over, slamming into
words like sacks of potatoes into a pool of vinegar.
   A sign flashes consistently and at an insistent rate. It seems to want
you to look at it, and the maddening rapidity of the flashes makes it
nearly unavoidable. You need to vomit.

&+W   Within this chamber rests the responsibilities of the entire player-
&+Wbase.  Council members meet once per real-life week to discuss the many
&+Wissues facing their electorate, and as well, they decide on the variety
&+Wof complaints and problems that have been brought to their attention.
&+WThe council members may face many obstacles and conflicts on their way
&+Wto reaching resolution, but the players they represent have voted them
&+Win with confidence that equable solutions will be reached.  There is no
&+Wroom for partisanship, but instead, a merging of races and ideals so that
&+Wthe council can speak as one voice to the Immortals in presenting their
&+Wideas and concepts for improvements to this world.  As such, these
&+Wcouncil members are seen as the ideal player, and it can only be hoped
&+Wthat they keep this in mind when interacting and representing their

   Headquarters for the Code project coordinator, whomever that may be at
the moment. Little yellow post-it notes are strewn about the walls, with
various proc names written in illegible chicken scratch. On the east
wall, someone has hung a dartboard and placed a photograph in the center.
A box of stale dunkin donuts half covers a coffee stain on the
press-board desk, obviously a garage sale gem.  The pride and joy of the
code team, the main machine, sits happily upon its own personal table
with fold-out legs for easy portability. It beeps and whirls, making all
manner of noises as the code drones on. A sign, stuck on the monitor with
fun-tack, reads 'State of the art in Commodore technology'.

&+Rorganized pantheon of beings. Each layer of this god plane consists of a
&+Rriver of shifting fire that form vast arches through the empty space
&+Rbetween them. On this massive piece of hell almost a thousand meters wide,
&+Ris the massive temple to Tripod the Well Hung. The enormous black
&+Rstructure is made of smooth, burnt marble blocks. Within the building are
&+Rseveral rooms and long decorated hallways. In the middle of the temple is
&+Rthe chamber that Tripod uses as a throne room. The throne room is huge
&+Rwith a very high ceiling. To the far north of the chamber is the god's

Please take the time to look over these carefully and understand them.

participation partic par p~
Participation:

This refers to the level of participation each god is expected to contribute
to the mud in order to have a god of some power here.

What this is intended to teach you is that it IS a privilege to be God here
on Duris, not a right.  Once you have earned your immortality, you are an
example to all the others below you who would die to be in your shoes.  You
are expected to contribute to the mud in some way on a regular basis.  You
cant make one or two zones, get a god, and ride on fame forever here like you
could on Sojourn.  We do NOT mean you have to work every day or even every month
for that matter, but SOME contribution from every god is necessary to keep our
mud expanding and growing.

Remember, it is a privilege to be a god here, not a right.
~
E
cheating cheat c~
Cheating:

This is a sensative issue on any mud.  Cheating in general degrades a mud and
can do considerable damage to it's reputation when it occurs.

Thus, on Duris, we have developed a Very strict attitude towards cheating,
and you MUST understand it.  The policy is simple and to the point;

If you are caught cheating with your god, you will be deleted from the mud
loosing all god powers, no questions asked, no second chances.

This goes for Overlords as well as everyone else, Cheating is NOT tolerated here

We have adapted this strict policy to discourage people from cheating in the
first place.  Just don't do it, as its not worth the consequences if you are
caught.

And as a reminder, Duris has VERY detailed logs.  Almost everything you do as
a god is logged, dropping things, moving about, everything.

No, we are not trying to be policeman here, and we are not like Big Brother who
will always be watching over your shoulder.  Trust is a major factor for all of
us as gods, and without it, we will get nothing good done.  I almost never look
at the logs, but do occasionally when Im bored for grins.  So don't be nervous
about it, just don't cheat.  But if someone by
which is most often the case, you are history, period.

Thus the policy is set, you have read it and are expected to ablidge by it.
~
E
advancement advancement advance a~
Advancement:

On any mud, as is human nature in all things, we strive to be all we can be.
I have yet to meet a person who doesn't want to be Top Dog, and this is fine.

On Duris, we encourage you to participate and add to our mud, as all who add
to it in a significant way, will be moved up in the chain of command. Though
it will not be easy to move up the ladder, as the ladder is not too long here.

Remember, having your god is a Privilege, not a Right.

If you make a nice zone or add neat features or good code, you will move
up on the ladder, and be rewarded for your hard work.  We Forgers like to
encourage people to work hard and add to our world, a never ending process.

We need your help!

And with that said, if you work for us, you WILL be rewarded.  On the other
hand, no one g
scat.  We do NOT give away free gods or god levels, as that undermines the
entire principle of participation and is entirely unfair to those who have
worked hard to get where they are.  If you don't get the god of your choice,
and want to be higher, more work is probably the answer.

If however you feel cheated, you may request an audience in the next Forger
council meeting, where your concerns will be heard before open council.  We
can then make a fair vote on your case, and hopefully solve any problems.

As a mortal playing on any mud, we often get lost or have problems that are
far beyond our control.  This always happens no matter how good you make the
code.

Thus there WILL be situations where you are the only god around and some
problem has arisen.  It is your Responsibility as a god to know the mud and
it's general workings, so that you might be able to help out when something
goes
up the chain, that is NOT wrong or bad to do.

But We don't want a bunch of gods running around who know nothing about the
mud, and can't answer simple questions that a mortal might ask.  If you dont
feel knowledge enough about things, try to learn so you will be ready.

Remember, you represent our entire mud when you talk one on one with a mortal.
You are the god, and your actions will reflect heavily upon us all. One god who
makes a dumb mistake to the right person could be disastrous. They could whine
all over the internet and newsgroups about how horrible Duris is.  That would
be very damaging and embarrassing as I'm sure you will agree.

So if there is a problem beyond your control, don't blow em off, get help.

&+BCreators Workshop and Meeting Place~
   Reality enters a flux here.  Patterns of time and space flow like
snaky cords through the room in &+rs&+Yh&+Gi&+gm&+Bm&+be&+cr&+mi&+Mn&+Rg&n colors,
gigantic knot in the center of the room.  When a stray strand of
reality breaks loose, all Chaos erupts.  Sirens go off, bells clang,
whistles hoot and mortals find mysterious ways of gaining three levels
by stomping sewer rats.  Creator gods and their summoned slaves race
about trying to get things back into Order.  The gathering place of
the creative forces of Duris is not a well organized place, but then
neither is most of reality.  They're working on it, one area at a time.
   There is a large conference table here, floating in nothingness.
Notes and books also float about the room, jottings of area creators
made to enlighten those new at shaping reality.  Oddly, there is also a
&+Rlarge, shiny, red button&n floating right in your face.

large shiny button~
When taking a further glance at the enticingly shiny, red button, you here
a voice scream from across the room
&+W      'DON'T TOUCH THAT!  IT'S THE HISTORY ERASER BUTTON!'

You back away in alarm and horror...

&+RThe Great Audience Hall Of The Overlords&n~
   &+rFour chairs sit around a four-sided table with four seas in
&+rthe distance, as seen through four wide windows with a view that
&+rseems to stretch around all the mortal world, like strands of silver
&+rwebbing spun to infinity and back.

&+rHall of &+RD&+LI&+rS&+RC&+LO&+rR&+RD&+r on the Plane Pandemonium&n~
   &+LThis is the abode of Xyzom, The Lord of Discord and God of the Drow&N
&+LElves. The most noticeable feature is the howling wind, ripping through&N
&+LA series of off pitch wind chimes creating a ferocius din. The walls of&N
&+Lthe room are draped with garish black, red, and orange curtains that&N
&+Lare continuously tossed by the wind. There is a large flat table in&N
&+Lthe middle of the room. Looking closely at the table, it becomes quite&N
&+Lobvious that it constitutes one of the projects Xyzom is currently working&N
&+Lon. The room itself, windchimes, table, curtains, and all are suspended in&N
&+Lthe middle of one of the vast tunnels of wind that constitute the&N
&+Lfabled first layer of pandemonium. There is obviously no escape from&N
&+Lthis noisy windy hell, and that is exactly the way Xyzom likes it.&N
&+LLooking carefully at the floor however, there is a small crack in the&N
&+Lred veined black marble that might just be wide enough for an escape!&N

&+BA Large picture hangs on the wall with the words &+YNaughty Mortal&N
&+YCamera&N &+Bengraved below it&N

&+bA Great Pool of Energy on the &+BPlane of Nirvana.~
   &+bA gigantic&n &+Csilvery pool&+b that is round and extends in all&n
&+bdirections
&+bitself extends too far for the mortal eye to see.  There are huge&n
&+binterlocking wheels, that connect to each other like the gears of a&n
&+bfinely crafted clock.  These wheels are made of matter and are&n
&+bapproximately 500 or more miles across.  There is a strange box&n
&+bresting here.  There is a portal to the Prime Material Plane that&n
&+bextends downward.  Another portal, which appears to be east, leads to&n
&+bthe&n &+CConcordant Opposition&+b.

   This is a device of unknown origin, it has a glowing
face, with strange inscriptions that appear on it, and in
front of it, there is a flat tablet with little squares that
stick out of the top of the tablet.

&+LAn Unmarked &+wGrave&N~
&+w   You m&+Lagically appear within an unmarked grave.   The walls of this grave are marked with
&+wlong clawing &+Lscratches as though someone has attempted escape into the afterlife once more,
&+wand seem to rise u&+Lp as far as you can see.   Terrifying screams and moans of people in pain
&+wfill the area with a se&+Lnse of danger.  The ground is covered with the remains of some
&+wof the ever so unfortunate. &+L A skeletal hand seems to reach with skeletal fingers from one
&+wof the crevices in the ground.&n
