&+LA Recently Unearthed Chamber~
   A recent earthquake has revealed a crack in the mountains, leading to a
hollowed out ancient chamber.  Strong circular pillars support the large
amount of earth and rock which, until recently, had protected this chamber
from all would be explorers.  Plain, triangular stone slabs make up the floor
of the room.  A very thick layer of dust covers the ground.  Noone has been
here in centuries.  A dusty &+ytome&n sits upon a pedestal of &+Lobsidian rock&n in the
center of the large chamber.

tome book~
This ancient tome is covered with the same amount of dust that graces the
floor.  The book is open to a page which seems to contain the last incantations
of a powerful glyph.  Touching the book or trying to change the page would
surely destroy the tome.  A few letters can be deciphered through the dust.

Approaching a &+LLarge Iron&n Gate~
   This area is very dark and it makes scanning ahead very difficult.  Through
the darkness and unsettled dust, a large gate can just barely be distinguished.
The entire area seems to be quiet, except for the reverberating footsteps of
the party.  The walls and ceiling of this hidden area are rather plain.  The
floor is made up of interlocking, equilateral triangles.

Before a &+LLarge Iron&n Gate~
   The chamber opens up into an enormous room here.  An iron gate has been
crafted in the northern wall, standing 80 feet high.  Two equal recesses have
been placed on either side of the large gate.  The recesses could easily
accomodate a giant, but it's unlikely a giant could survive in these environs
for long without food and water.  It would take a group effort to even budge
the gate doors if somehow the massive gates could be unlocked.

This massive gate blocks entry to the north.  Even tho the gate is 80 feet in
height, the keyhole is only 5 feet above the ground.

&+LA Small Chamber with a &+bPortal~
&+L   This room is far smaller than the previous.  The only noticeable feature of
&+Lthis chamber is a shimmering &+bblue portal&+L that casts an eerie light upon the
&+Lwalls cutting through the darkness.  Faint outlines of hideous beasts appear
&+Lin the portal from time to time.  The air in this room is very &+Ccold&+L - far
&+Lcolder than the others.  It almost seems as if a chilling draft is coming from
&+Lthe portal.

&+mThe &+rScorched &+mPlains of &+LApocalypse~
   This land is barren.  The ground is dry and cracked, as if it has gone
centuries without water or plantlife.  The scorched ground stretches out in all
directions seemingly without end.  The only decorations of these plains are
petrified trees, lifeless like a statue and just as hard.  A bizarre &+mpurple
sky covers the land.  It is neither dark nor light in this world... only
perpetual twilight.  The sky is beautiful and horrific at the same time.

centuries without water or plantlife.  The scorched ground stretches out in all
directions seemingly without end.  The only decorations of these plains are
petrified trees, lifeless like a statue and just as hard.  A bizarre &+mpurple
sky covers the land.  It is neither dark nor light in this world... only
perpetual twilight.  The sky is beautiful and horrific at the same time.

&+LThe &+bCenter&+L of a Ruined Town~
   This appears to be the crossroads of a town that has been left in ruins for
aeons.  A destroyed well has dried up, and the blocks which surrounded it have
crumbled.  Two desolate streets cross here leading in all directions.  To the
north, a gloomy castle rises into the purple sky.  A strange &+bblue slab&n has been
placed before the well.  Unlike the rest of this desolate town, it shows signs
of life.

   This street might have been quite scenic before it was destroyed, but it is
hard to tell now.  Maplethorpe road runs north and south between mounds of
rubble which, at one time, were shops and houses.  To the north, the outline of
a foreboding castle can be seen.  To the left and right, buildings in various
stages of decay can be found.

   At this point, Orangegrove street crossed Maplethorpe road.  Orangegrove
is a smaller street which was home to the middle class portion of the town
judging by the size and craftsmanship of the houses.  To the north, an ominous
castle stands, but there appears to be some rubble blocking the path towards
the castle.

   The road here comes to an abrupt end.  The walls of a large building to the

available to the castle ahead, it will not be from this road.  The only exit
from here is south back onto maplethorpe road.

&+LAn Abandoned Bar~
   The only things remaining in this room are a few broken chairs and tables
and a partially standing bar table.  A few bottles line the shelves behind the
bar - fewer still are intact.  The roof of this bar has a gaping hole in it.
Through the hole, the &+mmagenta sky&n - a trademark of this barren world, can be
seen.

&+LA Former &+cArmor&+L Shop~
   Rusted suits of platemail and ragged leather tunics line the floor of this
ancient armory.  At one time, suits of armor were sold on a regular basis to
the inhabitants of the town.  Shields, gauntlets, greaves, and vambraces have
been stored in shattered display cases.  Whatever destroyed this town seemed
to have only affected living tissue.  There appears to be no damage, other
than that done by father time, to the contents of this store.

&+LA Former &+rWeapons&+L Shop~
   This shop was evidentally a place where the citizens of this town could
purchase weapons to hunt or defend themselves.  All of the weapons that were
of any magical value have likely been taken, leaving simple steel and wood
weapons behind to decay.  Of all the shops in the town, this building seems
to have held up quite well to the test of time.

&+LA Destroyed Section of &+gMaplethorpe Road~
   This street might have been quite scenic before it was destroyed, but it is
hard to tell now.  Maplethorpe road runs north and south between mounds of
rubble which, at one time, were shops and houses.  To the north, the outline of
a foreboding castle can be seen.  To the left and right, buildings in various
stages of decay can be found.

   At this point, two streets converge at an intersection.  Crimson street
intersects maplethorpe on the southern end of the town.  To the east and west
crimson street is lined with houses that aren't as large or decorative as those
found in the north part of the town.  The remnants of a bakery can be seen to
the north, and maplethorpe continues to the south.

   Destroyed stoves and pastry cases indicate this building was used as a
bakery for the town before it's demise.  Decaying wooden planks hang from the
walls and ceiling.  A few chairs have withstood the perils of aging well - a
testament to their craftsman.  Whatever food products that were in the store
when the town seemingly died have disintegrated.

   Opulance was rare in this part of town.  This two-story home sticks out like
a sore thumb.  The family that previously occupied this town appears to have
been much better off than the rest of crimson street.  Perhaps the field that
is visible to the east was part of their property.  Some well-constructed
furniture has defied destruction, but it's demise is certain given enough
time.  A rickety staircase leads to the second floor.

   This room was evidently used as a bedroom for three people.  Two of the beds
are full-sized, and one is much smaller - possibly made for a child.  A window
in the east wall allows for a view of the field further down crimson road.  A
gaping hole dominates the south wall.  Holes in the ceiling also create a
hazard.  Care should be taken, for a plunge from this height would be painful
to say the least.

is exclusively houses.  Rubble has settled almost everywhere in this house.
Just another tragedy of an abandoned village.

The cobblestone road acted as the primary artery into and out of the town, so
it was likely created with longevity in mind.  A butchers shop is north.

   A rusted iron gate has collapsed on the ground here marking the entrance to
the town.  The heavy gate was, at one time, hinged to two buildings north and
south of the road.  Since there are no walls surrounding this town, the gate
was really nothing more than a showpiece.  It would offer no protection from
an advancing army or the like.  Trying to advance out of the village, results
in a strange magical shove backwards.  Strong magic seems to have contained
this cursed town.

   This bedroom is quite large.  It has withstood the test of time quite
admirably.  A shattered vanity adorns the southern wall, suggesting the prior
occupant was a female - perhaps the matriarch of the family.

&+BA Large Bedroom~
   A king-sized bed dominates the room.  The size of the bed gives testament
to the strength of the floor boards of this room.  Poor construction would
have allowed the massive bed to fall through the ceiling long ago.

&+MA Small, Well-Constructed Home~
   Although this house is small, it has been created with style and precision.
The wood used in making the walls must have been of the utmost quality because
it is withstanding the elements quite well.  This was probably the home of
a solitary mage.  The designs on the walls indicate a scholarly man who is
not interested in exuberance.

&+gThe Entrance to a &+GMagical Garden~
   Unbelievably, to the north a garden with thriving plantlife has survived in
a dimension tormented by death and desolation.  Soft green grass cushions the
feet.  After endless travel on cracked ground, the feel of grass is like
heaven.

&+gAn Out-of-place Garden~
   This area must be magically enchanted, because unlike the rest of this
strange dimension, plantlife is abundant and thriving.  A magical fountain,
which is the likely source of the life in this garden can be found in the
northeast corner.  The exit to Willow street is to the south.  A large tree
grows near the north wall.

&+CA Magical Fountain &+gin the Garden~
   This portion of the garden is dominated by a fountain which seems to have an
endless supply of water recirculating through it's sytem.  Plants and flowers
gravitate towards the large silver-colored fountain.  The lush grass offers
a welcome blanket to sleep on, and the gurgling fountain would offer a nice
soothing music to ease the transition into the dream world.  An enormous tree
can be seen to the west.  It is so large that some of it's branches clear the
northern wall of the village.

   This large tree can support many people at once due to its size.  Heavy
branches extend in all directions.  Travel is blocked by many twigs and leaves.

   This strong branch of the tree extends north from the tree.  The thick
branch supports the weight of many people with ease.  To the north the branch
thins out and becomes weaker.  If one were to fall from this branch, it is
unlikely that they would be able to reach the tree.  The branch, at this point,
is directly over the wall enclosing the garden.

   This temple was erected in reverence to a long-forgotten God.  The ceiling
is barely being supported by cracking columns of what was once a polished
marble.  The vaulted ceiling is twenty feet high, and a cracking mural has
painstakingly painted above.  Stained glass windows adorn the east and west
walls, though many have been broken.  A large altar can be seen to the north.

&+gA Small Path Leading up to a &+LSmall Building~
  This path leads north towards a building.. possibly an office of some kind.
To the east and west, trails lead into the foliage.  The circular path around
the building begins to the south.  Growls ring out from the foliage, and the
humidity in this bizarre tropical area is thick enough to cut with a knife.

&+gA &+LDead-end &+gin the Atrium Forest~
   Here the foliage is so thick, there is only one way out and that is taking
the trail back to the intersection.  Red eyes gleam out of the thick grass
like a bad nightmare.  Swarms of flying insects populate this humid, hellish
garden.  This garden could only be the creation of the Horseman of Pestilence.

&+yThe Groundskeepers Office~
   This small building has been designed as an office and sleeping quarters
for the groundskeeper.  The groundskeeper has the duties of maintaining the
castle and attending to the guests.  The groundskeeper has access to all the
rooms in the castle.  The office is rather cluttered.  A makeshift desk has
been constructed, and several pieces of parchment can be found atop the desk.

that prevents access to the spires of the castle.  The passageway is quite
large and would allow beasts of enormous size to pass through easily.

&+L   The screams of those s&noul&+Ls which the Horseman of &nDeath&+L has claimed fill
&+Lthe air in his chamber.  &nDeath&+L seems to thrive off the pain of those who
&+Lhave fallen at his hand.  He keeps their s&noul&+Ls present and enjoys their
&+Lscreams of &+ragony&+L.  The darkness becomes an asset to &nDeath&+L as he is able
&+Lto move about almost undetected.

&+LThe Entry to a &+LLarge &+rBlood Splattered&+L Stairwell~
&+L   This very large stairwell has been splattered heavily with &+rblood&+L - fresh
&+rblood&+L.  The otherwise plain stairwell stretches to the south.  Piles of bodies
&+Lhave been discarded in various spots throughout the staircase.  The sheer
&+Lamount of the bodycount suggests a war was fought here.  It is hard to tell who
&+Lthe victor was.. or if there was a victor.

&+LThe Bottom of the Staircase~
&+L   The bodycount is increasing.  Bodies lie strewn about these large chambers
&+Las if they were victims of war... The battlefield is crimson red.  Above, a
&+Lstaircase rises up into a large, imposing tower.

&+LThe Tower of &+rWar~
&+L   The combatants whose bodies lie here appear to be stronger.  Possibly the
&+Lelite members of the army who perished here in the castle of demons.  It almost
&+Lappears as if a massive group of people were summoned here and forced to fight
&+Lto the top of the tower.  Apparently, noone made it to the top.

&+LThe Lair of the Horseman of &+rWar~
&+L   This strange, dark area is a testament to the greatest generals and leaders
&+Lof warring nations.  Stoic figures in gleaming platemail with ornate helmets
&+Lhave been represented here.  The greatest generals of the &+ydwarves&+L, &+bogres&+L,
&+chumans&+L, and orcs all have a statue.  Perhaps the Horseman of &+rWar&+L enjoys the
&+Lcompany of men whose lives were dedicated to that which he loves most - mass
&+Lgenocide.

&+YThe Vault of the Keepers~
&+Y   This large room has housed the treasures of a long forgotten empire for
&+Ycenturies.  The people who created this vault and the portal which cealed
&+Ythe apocalypse demons in their world had stored many valuable items and
&+Yartifacts in this vault for safekeeping and as a reward to any who were
&+Yable to challenge and defeat the horsemen.

&+LA Secret Tunnel in the Castle~
&+L  This small tunnel seems to have been made into an escape route from the
&+Lcastle.  Perhaps it was created by the original owners of the fortress to
&+Lescape if ever the castle should come under siege.  To the north a swirling
&+Lportal seems to have been placed.  This tunnel is only large enough for
&+Lhumanoids to fit through.
