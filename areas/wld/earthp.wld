&+yA System of Large Passages.~
   &+yThis section seems to have been more eaten through than dug by other
&+ysections.  It goes out in every direction you see twisting through the
&+ysolid rock in a zig zag pattern.  The rock here seems to have some minerals
&+yinside it, these &n&+Yminerals&n&+y could possibly be eatible pieces for a different
&+yof life.

&+yA Winding System of &n&+YPassageways&n&+y.~
  &+yThis area appears to be a system of tunnels dug or maybe rock that has
&+ybeen eaten.  The &n&+Lrock&n&+y here seems to have a more of a soft mineral content
&+ythan other &n&+Lrock&n&+y here.  This maze of tunnels goes in all directions you see.
