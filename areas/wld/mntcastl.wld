&+BA Small Lake&n &+gin a Lush Plateau&n~
   This small lake is quite serene, fitting perfectly into this
untouched environment.  It is surrounded by sheer walls on the
northern and western sides, and is fed a constant supply of fresh
water from the snow capped mountains above.  Its clear surface is
rippled by the occasional fish that tries for a floating insect.

   Looking at this clearing it is obvious that it is a fairly
popular place.  Looking out on to the lake and surrounded by
trees, the pleasure and relaxation is a welcome reprieve.  A
small sandy beach of sorts, leads into the lake affording an
appealing swimming area.

would not be formed and ruin the surrounding beauty.  In an

The trail however does not appear to have been used in sometime

&+BA Stream&n &+gThrough a Lush Plateau&n~
   This small stream winds its way through the plateau.  Its
source is the small lake to the north.  Whilst it does not deal
with a large volume of water, it supplies enough to keep the
valley lush and green.  Small immature fish can be seen nestling
in the rocky floor of the stream and quickly scatter when
disturbed.

   Carrying the water from the melted snow, this small river bed
has a constant supply of water, which drains into the valley below.
The river bed itself is mainly comprised of a hard granite rock,
which due to the constant flow of water has been worn smooth over
the years.  Trout can be seen laying their eggs in the nooks and
cranies that have escaped the errosion of the water and can be seen
clearly through its crystal surface.

   This empty shop has not been occupied in quite some time.  The
counter of the shop is covered in dirt and grim and is starting to
show signs of damage, due to the lack of care.  Cobwebs line the
roof and walls, with their owners hiding among the cracks in the
walls.  The once clean floor, is now slippery with stagnating water,
and the first signs of mold are just beginning.  The entrance to the
shop consists only of a set of dirty windows, and a door whose
hinges have rusted beyond repair, and have left the door in a half
open state.

   The top of the castle spire is suprisingly dank.  Offering
none of the spectacular views of the lowers levels.  The
windows have been draped in heavy cloth and the only light
comes from magical orbs floating in the air.  Books and
various spell components litter the floor, and the bare stone
has a sheen of dust to it.  A desk and chair, are the only
visable furniture in the room, and they are covered in a fine
dust also.

&+LA&n &+wGranite&n &+LStairway&n~
   Travelling down at a steepish angle this stairway leads below
the Du'Maathe castle spire and into the prison cells.  Sconces
line the wall at regular intervals, and are set with slow burning
torches that provide enough light to traverse the stairway.  The
stair itself has been made from huge granite blocks that have been
pieced together to form the stair.  A distinct lack of breeze from,
the bottom of the stair implies that the lower levels are carved
from the mountian itself.

   Leading north is a corridor that the guards use to patrol the
prison cells, and to feed and water the prisoners.  To the south
is the only exit from the prison, and the granite stair that leads
to freedom.  The prison itself is a fairly simple system, where
wards protect those who police it and stop those who should be
there from escaping.

   This stone walkway gives access to the prison cells of the
Du'Maathe castle.  The cell doors line the corridor and allow
the guards to keep an eye on their occupants.  The doors
themselves are contsructs from a thick oak, and are reinforced
with iron bands, a small section of the door has been cut away
from the door to allow for the the prisoners to be fed, and also
to provide some ventilation and light for the captives.

&+LA&n &+cPrison Cell&n &+Lof the&n &+rDu'Maathe&n &+LCastle&n~
   The cell has been carved from the mountain itself and offers
little chance of escape.  The only exit from the cell is via a
thick oak door, which has no need to be opened, due to the little
carving in the middle, through which food and water can be passed.
The cell is fairly large and can hold a number of prisoners at any
one time.  A set of shackles have been set into the wall for
problem or dangerous prisoners, and should the need arise a small
rune has been carved into the door, which a guard can attivate by
word.

   This spiralling stair leads deeper in to the mountain beneath the

from the wall, and curve down with a set patern.  Positioned at
regular intervals are sconces which have rusted with age, and in some
of them the last remains of the torches they once held crumble to dust
at the touch.  Small scraping sounds can be heard in the darkness at
the bottom of the stairs, the sounds origine cannot be determined
however.

&+LNeglected Tunnels Beneath the&n &+rDu'Maathe&n &+LCastle&n~
   These dark and dusty tunnels very existence seems to have
been forgotten.  The tunnels being crafted in to the mountain
itself.  The walls and the ceilings are showing signs of
disrepair, in that the very surface seems to crumble at the
touch.  There are small tracks that wind through the dusty
floor, obviously made by the animals that now call the tunnels
home.

&+BShallow Riverbed&n~
   Carrying the water from the melted snow, this small river bed has
a constant supply of water, which drains into the valley below.  The
river bed itself is mainly comprised of a hard granit rock, which due
to the constant flow of water has been worn smooth over the years.
Trout can be seen laying their eggs in the nooks and cranies that have
escaped the errosion of the water and can be seen clearly through its
crystal surface.

   Giving access to the Cheltenham village, this tiny wooden bridge
crosses a slow flowing river which is fed from the melting snow in
the mountains to the north of the village.  To the south is a little
used dirt road, whos primary function is to allow the villagers an
entry and an exit from the village.  The bridge has been constructed
around allowing a cart and horse team, so that the produce from the
village can be taken to outside markets.  Made from a sturdy and thick
wood, this bridge is more than able to do the task for which it was
constructed.

   This small road is mainly used by the villagers of the
Cheltenham village to cart their produce to the bigger cities

years of use from the villagers.  The remains of ruts caused
by the carts from last years harvest can just be seen, as they
deteriate and the road repairs itself.  On either side of the
road is the beginnings of a forest which streches out from the
base of the mountains to the north.

&+WA Small Steaming&n &+bPool&n~
   Located back from the limestone cavern, this small pool of steaming
water is thought to promote healing and is sort after as regenerative
tonic.  The milky colored water puts out a fine mist that gives the
cavern and the surrounding caves a humid temperature.  It also helps
promote some fungal growth that seems to thrive in this dark and damp
cavern.

   The walls of this passage have been worn smooth, from the

is a limestone composite, and gives the water a cloudy look to
it.  The water is quite warm and small algae can be seen floating
near the surface of the passage.

&+LA Small Cave Entrance&n~
   Hidden from view by the bushes that over look the wheat fields
this small cave entrance leads into a limestone cavern.  The fairly
low roof restricts any quick movements, and also stops the light
penetrating further into the cave.  Small green vines grow up the
side of the cave mouth and continue up the side of the mountain,
providing a degree of secrecy.  The walls and floors of the cave
are smooth, suggesting that at some stage it was an outlet for a
stream of some sort.

&+LA Hiding Place Among the&n &+GBushy Shrubs&n~
   This small area north of the wheat fields has been kept a
closely guarded secret by the youths of the village, obviously
seeking a hiding place from their chores.  Scattered across the
ground are the remains of what are most likely stolen pies and
bread.  A small shelf of sorts has been constructed in one corner
with all sorts of scavenged items, including a small pile of
stones - to arm one of the slings lying on the ground.  A rather
clever little tunnel leads to the fields, with the bushes growing
over the entrance concealing it from view.

&+LA Jumble of Interconnecting Passages&n~
   This maze of tunnels has been formed over a number of years
by miners, greedy for the last piece of ore.  The result is a
mess of tunnels that seems to lead nowhere with any set course.
Looking at the walls, one can see the last of the ore that was
just too much trouble to retrieve.  Jagged scars mare the walls
and create sharp outcrops which are sharp to the touch.  A
pervading damp fills the senses, and a warm humid temperature
makes these tunnels very muggy and unpleasant.

&+LA Jumble of Interconnecting Passages&n~
   This maze of tunnels has been formed over a number of years
by miners, greedy for the last piece of ore.  The result is a
mess of tunnels that seems to lead nowhere with any set course.
Looking at the walls, one can see the last of the ore that was
just too much trouble to retrieve.  Jagged scars mare the walls
and create sharp outcrops which are sharp to the touch.  A
pervading damp fills the senses, and a warm humid temperature
makes these tunnels very muggy and unpleasant.

   The fairly large wheat fields are an essential part of the
village economy.  Providing not only enough wheat for the
village to remain subsistant, but also enough to provide a
lucrative trade with the bigger towns and cities.  The fields
are tended to daily by the village men, and they can be seen
working from the early hours until the dark forces them indoors.

   This black marble hallway has been carved by some expert craftsmen.
Depicted along the floor, ceilings and walls of the hallway are
pictures of dragons, whether they be in combat or at rest.  Despite
the beauty of the craftsmenship and the wide open hallway a sensation
of fear and dread is almost overpowering, the source of this discomfort
is unknown.

guests to move between rooms and other areas of the castle.
It is quite common to see servants bringing beverages to the

afforded by the castle spire though, people who are not to be

   This chamber is simply furnished, allowing a castle guest
a comfortable stay.  It is lit by a magical orb that floats
in the center of the room, and is bathed in a soft blue light.
Without windows it is not a very appealing place to spend ones
time, as every effort has been made to show the castle views
to everyone, as opposed to a select few.

guests to move between rooms and other areas of the castle.
It is quite common to see servants bringing beverages to the
guests at all hours of the day.  Given the spectacular views
afforded by the castle spire though, people who are not to be
found in their rooms are often found looking over the
surrounding landscape.

   This chamber is simply furnished, allowing a castle guest
a comfortable stay.  It is lit by a magical orb that floats
in the center of the room, and is bathed in a soft blue light.
Without windows it is not a very appealing place to spend ones
time, as every effort has been made to show the castle views
to everyone, as opposed to a select few.
