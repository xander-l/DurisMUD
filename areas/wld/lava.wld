&+L   A tight tunnel squeezes into a very hot, dry, and dark place.  The
&+Lwalls are solid rock that seems to have been burrowed out by some force
&+Lunknown.  Echoes ring from deep within.  A gas like substance can be
&+Lsmelt.  A warm breeze passes, escaping outside.&n

&+Mconditions.  The area is guarded when possible, to keep trouble out.
&+MHorde smells are bellowing from deep within the cavern.  Incredible

&+LThere are many eerie sounds of unknown creatures in the distance.&n

&+c   This is a vacant room above the inn.  This room is neatly fixed up
&+cfor the next customer.  There are two beds on each side of the room.
&+cThe wooden floor has been swept.  On the west side of the room is a
&+csmall window.  Some wilted flowers have been setup next to each bed.
&+cThe room is well lit with a couple of lanterns.  There is a sense of
&+crefreshment being here.&n

&+L   This is a small lookout post for the town guards.  The post is
&+yof wooden construction that has been built off the corner a busy
&+yintersection.  This was made for several safety reasons.  The ceiling
&+yconsists of the cavern itself.   The post has numerous lanterns hung
&+yon the walls.  From this point you can look out over most of the town.
&+yThe post has been neatly kept up.  The trapdoor leads back down to the
&+Lcavern foyer.&n

&+r   The lava spring cavern is extremely hot.  The stale air has the
&+rsmell of rotting corpses.  Most likely the corpses of the fire demon's
&+rvictims.  The only available light in this cavern is coming from the
&+rlava itself.  The lava springs are little mounds of earth that are
&+rfilled with molten lava.  Under the cavern floor are various lava tubes
&+rwhich transport the lava to the springs.  It seems as if there is a
&+rsense of dagger in the air.  A loud roar can be heard deep within the
&+rcavern.&n

&+r   Voinak's throne room is inside a large lava spring.  There doesn't
&+rseem to be any way out of this spring.  The spring is extremely hot
&+rinfact the heat is almost unbearable.  The lava is keeping a constant
&+rflow around the spring.  The stale air has the smell of rotting
&+rcorpses.  Most likely the corpses of Voinak's prey.  Towards the back
&+rof the room is a large throne which belongs to Voinak.  The throne is
&+rnicely decorated and seems to be floating.&n

&+L   This is a small lookout post for the town guards.  The post is
&+yof wooden construction that has been built off the corner a busy
&+yintersection.  This was made for several safety reasons.  The ceiling
&+yconsists of the cavern itself.   The post has numerous lanterns hung
&+yon the walls.  From this point you can look out over most of the town.
&+yThe post has been neatly kept up.  The trapdoor leads back down to the
&+Lcavern foyer.&n
