&=lLEntrance to an abandoned cave~
&=lLThis cave seems to have been created by some magical force of awesome power.
&=lLThe exit the north seems to have been used recently however the room shows
&=lLno sign of use for some time.  Beneath your feet there lies baren rock that
&=lLhas been tainted black as death somehow.  The room is empty save a few large
&=lLboulders that seem to watch all who enter the cave.

&+Lsolely by large patches of &+gph&+Gos&+gph&+Gor&+gant &+Ggreen moss&+L. There seems to have been no
&+Lattempt made to furnish the chamber, save a large mural that has been painted
&+Ldirectly upon the domed ceiling overhead. The painting depicts a scene of great
&+Ldestruction, in which three &+rdra&+Lgo&+gns&+L of differing colors are ravaging the world.

&+Lis apparently used as temporary sleeping quarters for the guild's inhabitants.
