   &+rThe walls here are thickly veined with durithalite, which through&N

&+rslightly, at its brightest almost bright enough to allow normal vision&N
&+rin this room, but in reality just making it impossible for surface world&N
&+reyes to adjust to the light levels in the cavern. There are a multitude&N
&+rof exits from this room, but the one to the east requires special&N

immaculate rows of fungus tirelessy, out of fear of their cruel Drow
taskmasters. The cavern itself here is massive, with a ceiling extending
hundreds of feet above the farming floors. Gypsum flowers coat the walls of
this massive cavern, except in the portions webbed by thick veins of
durithalite, which does not promote the growth of these strange rock
blossums. There is a large building to the northeast and a gallows ahead in

   Hell road follows along the south side of an odd stone building with a
mushroom stalk roof. There are no window in the side of the building, which
is odd for a building of this size. To the south there is a large gallows,
which makes this general vicinity of the cave take on a most foul odor of
death mixed with mushroom fertilizer. The road continues to the east and west
towards the edges of this very large cave.

&+MBend in Hell Road&N~
   The road takes a sharp bend form east-west to north-south here. A person
traveling in from the north would probably argue the opposite perspective
however. The reason for this bend is quite obvious, especially to the
traveler coming from the east, as they would run into a large basalt and
durithalite wall if it was not for this bend northward. The wall, in
addition to being an obstacle to eastward travel is covered with gypsum
flowers, which dont look like flowers at all, unless viewed through eyes
that are attached to a body that has consumed far too much ale or smoked
too much pipeweed, or both.

&+MHell Road on the East Side of a Large Building&N~
   The road here stretches along the east side of a large building. To the
east of the road a massive cavern opens up. The cavern is probably 200 feet
tall at its apex and contains a nice sized lake rimmed by mushroom farms.
Hell Road, after passing by the east side of this building, passes by the
western end of this lake. Looking to the south, the cavern is almost as
impressive to behold but somewhat smaller. A gallows hangs to the southwest.

of their slavery, at the hands of a drow executioner. The gallows itself is
charred and coated with creosote. The lack of a noose indicates that hanging
is not the method of execution reserved for the inobediant Svirfneblin.
Instead, by the body parts strewn upon the ground, a varity of mutilations
seem to be used ranging from simple disembowelment, to live complete
lobotomy. The ground here is covered with gnome remnants and fecal matter.

   The Mushroom grove is thin here as the south end of the lake confines it
to a narrow strip between the lakes end and the cavern wall. To the east and
west the grove extends, but to the north the lake extends for a good distance
across this cavern before curving to the west. Small spore balls float on
the surface of the lake here, landing so softly they produce nary a wave as

   It really stinks here! There are many odors of the underworld, but few to
be feared as much as the combination of rothe hide, rothe scat, svirfneblin
sweat and decomposing svirfneblin and rothe corpses. The method of harvesting
the rothe from their pasture is very efficient. That which does not become
drow dinner is left on the field to rot to become substrate for new pasture.
The corpses of the butchered svirfneblin slaves who have not met the cruel
performance standards of their wicked drow masters bear witness to their fate
worse than that of the rothe. It is rumored that svirfneblin steaks are
served in the houses of the lower class drow.

of pain and death. Here in the heart of the Underworld, Arachdrathos is the
epitome of all that is evil and unholy. It is rumored that there is a
direct link to the web of Lolth somewhere behind these gates. Then again,
that is just one of the many rumors that surround this city at the heart of

&+BNortheast Corner of the Great Llzazan Lake&N~
   The lake here extends to the west and south, expanding towards a grove of
giant mushrooms, some of which seem to tower almost a hundred feet overhead.
The water here is very still, very clear and very cold. High overhead the
ceiling of this cavern glows dimly with a rich quantity of durithalite,
reflecting softly on the water in the darkness.

&+rThe Tavern of the Decapitated Dwarves&N~
   Long ago, before the fall of House Llzazan to the combined Houses of
Arachdrathos, this portion of the Llzazan Caverns was the site of a great
battle, where Drow and Dwarf clashed over rich Durithalite deposits in
the area. It was where this tavern now stands, that a contingent of Llzazan
house nobles captured and executed a large band of Dwarven prisoners.
Fourteen skulls are bolted to the west wall of this taverrn, directly above
the bar. These fourteen skulls are the decapitated heads of the Dwarves the
Llzazan Nobles siezed on that day. This odd shrine to drow battle prowess
makes the Tavern of the Decapitated Dwarves one of the few sources of pride
for the downtrodden people of the Llzazan Ghetto.

this shop are all but eroded form disuse. The east wall once sported the
entrance to a forge, but the old door, as well as the forge were razed

overlooks a vast expanse of space. A huge vertical shaft with neither floor
nor ceiling in sight. Throughout the shaft, a giant spiderweb stretches.
Large rock islands hang in space, supported by this great web, and from these
islands spring great spires of durithalite and basalt, spiraling into the
blackness of this shaft. The great arch of house Zarbonosti presides over
the center of the cavern, thrusting upwards from the spider web in defiance
to all that seems sane about this world. A horrendous wind howls in from
above making the entire cavern groan with the force of a million screams.
Below in this windy web lies the jewel of the underworld, Arachdrathos.

&+RThe Llzazan Road&N~
   The road here continues from a hole in the cave ceiling. There is a thick
coating of fungus chips and rothe dung on the ground here, and some
footprints have tracked through it, especially near the south wall of the
cave. Flecks of durithalite dimly illuminate this section of the road,
allowing just enough light for drow eyes, but way too little for any creature
of the surface.

&+RThe Llzazan Road&N~
   The road here comes out of a hole in the cave floor to travel to the east.
The floor here is littered with rothe excrement and pieces of mushroom,
giving the floor a certain bouncy spongyness.  Footprints disrupt the putrid
carpet of muck, especially along the northern wall of the cave. The road
continues towards the manufacturing distric to the east.

&+RA Bend on the Great Llzazan Road&N~
   The road here bends form west to north as it travels between the farms
and the manufacturing district. There is a generous piling of excement and
fungus fragments on the road here, making for some rather unusual footing.
The stench here is also quite unusual and there is very little positive
that can be said about this road.

&+rA Room Full of Junk&N~
   This room is full of odds and ends, dinnerware, chalices, crates and
whatnot, all of which seem rather worthless, except perhaps to the inhabitant
of this abode. It is well hidden from the street and fairly undisturbed by
the comings and goings in the Llzazan Ghetto. There is also a small rotheskin
bedroll in the coerner of the room and a small, smelly bucket in the other
corner.

   The road here trails off to the south after coming through a hole in the
ceiling. Many rotten pieces of mushroom timbers litter the road as well as
a fair helping of rothe manure. There is a small quantity of durithalite
in the tunnel illuminating the road for underworld eyes.

&+rA Commoner's Dwelling&N~
   This abode is very hastily assmebled from the rubble that lines the

   The road here bends form north to west as it travels through the Lower

road itself has a generous coating of rothe manure and fungus chips, giving
it a soft surface. The stench accompanying this odd surfacing however is
