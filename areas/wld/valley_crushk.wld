&+YOn the Rocky Trail~
 &+yThis is the start of a rocky trail which travels to the east. It is very
&+ydusty, dirty, and seems well traveled upon.  To the east you see a small
&+yvalley which the trail seems to travel through.  To the west you see a turning
&+ypoint of roads which lead north through the hills, before turning west
&+ytowards the city of Tharnadia.

&+yA &+LShady &+yHut&N~
   &+yThis small wooden house is made of the same type of local evergreens and pines
&+ythat grow in the neighboring forest.  A large desk sits on a far side of the room
&+yacross from a hard-iron stove.  A room down a short hallway leads to a small
&+ybedroom with a miniature fire place and chimney.  However quaint, this hut
&+yis nevertheless quite shady, as all the lights have been put out, the drapes
&+yclosed, and the furniture pushed against the doors.
