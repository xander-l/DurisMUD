&+LA Dark and Narrow Hallway&n~
&+W   Dust &+Lcollects in heeps upon the floor with the exception of tiny foot prints&n
&+Lleft by &+yrats&+L.  Black bricks make up the walls in this narrow hallway.  The     &n
&+Lstench of &+rdeath&+L is in the air here.  Its rotting smell burns your eyes causing &n
&+Lthem to tear.  Some &+Wbones&+L of warriors past lay on the ground here, perhaps as a&n
&+Lwarning.  A strange ungodly chill darts down your spine and fills you with a&n
&+Lstrange fear.  The hall continues to the north.&n

&+r   Blood &+Lis a river that flows in these dismal C&+ba&+Lt&+ba&+Lc&+bo&+Lmbs.  The floor here is&N
&+Lcovered with it and droplets of &+Rcrimson &+Lfall from the ceiling.  &+WSkulls &+Lof&n
&+Lwarriors past along with their &+Wbones &+Llitters the ground.  Living walls seem to&n
&+Lmove and sway.  &+CSo&+cul&+Cs &+Lof the lost struggling to escape their infernal &+reternal&n
&+Ltorment.  Screams of beyond echo within this abysmal &+revil &+Lplace.  The sounds&n
&+Lstart to fill you with an odd unholy &+Bchill&+L.  This room seems like it is a dead&n
&+Lend.&n
