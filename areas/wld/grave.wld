&+yApproaching an Old Graveyard~
   A small pebble path leads east into a large old graveyard.  The path seems
quite old and has survived many generations.  A few old trees line the path
which leads into the graveyard ahead.  Up ahead a large iron gate closes the
burial ground off from uninvited guests.  A corroded &+ywooden sign&n has been left
to rot on the south side of the path here.  Exits lead east towards the gate of
the graveyard, and west away from cemetery.

   A small pebble path leads east into a large old graveyard.  The path seems
quite old and has survived many generations.  A few old trees line the path
which leads into the graveyard ahead.  Up ahead a large iron gate closes the
burial ground off from uninvited guests.  A heavy darkness seems to cover the
entire area blanketing it in perpetual night.  Exits lead east towards the gate
of the graveyard, and to the west a path leads away from cemetery.

&+yBefore a Large &+LIron Gate~
   A small pebble path leads east into a large old graveyard.  The path seems
quite old and has survived many generations.  A few old trees line the path
which leads into the graveyard ahead.  Here, a large iron gate rusts after many
years of faithful service to the cemetery.  This large double iron gate stands
eight feet tall, but it doesn't appear strong enough to withstand a determined
adventurer from entering.  The gate here leads into the graveyard to the east,
and a worn pepple path leads west to the wilderness.

&+yThe Entrance to an Old Graveyard~
   The &+gmoss &ncovering the ground mixed with the humidity in the air has produced
a foggy effect which rises from the cemetery floor.  The light in this area is
sparse and it becomes difficult to tell what time of the day it is whilst in
the graveyard.  A simple iron fence stretches around the perimeter of the
graveyard and sharp metal points at the top of the fence prevents unwanted
visitors from hopping over to rob the graves.  A wide path leads east through
the large graveyard, and the a smaller path leads around the graveyard to the
south and north.

Along an &+LIron Fence &nin a &+yGraveyard~
   This small path leads around the entire graveyard.  Faint shapes appear and
disappear in the foggy mist which covers the cemetery.  Gravestones are dotted
about the area inside the graveyard.  A tall &+Liron fence&n with sharp pointed
tips surrounds the graveyard as a deterance from grave robbers and the like.
The squeeking of bats pierces the quiet murky air on occasion, and small vermin
scamper along the path.  Exits lead south and north along the fence.

   Before you stands a simple stone structure which houses the remains of a
single family.  Three of these structures have been constructed in the
graveyard.  The two on the northern side of the main path are smaller than
the southern crypt.  A sturdy stone double door has been placed as a silent
sentry against outsiders.  To the north, the door prevents entry into one
of the smaller tombs.

Before a Small Crypt Door~
   A small crypt has been made here beneath the graveyard.  An imposing steel
door closes the crypt off from outsiders.  The steel door has been set at a 45
degree angle upon a polished marble based wall.  The door seems to have stopped
the unwanted entry of grave-robbers on many occasions.  Failed lockpicking
attempts are obvious upon inspection of the keyhole.  The door has foiled all
efforts due to its intricate lock.  A key will most definitely be needed to
open this crypt door.

Above a &+LDark Crypt~
   Here, at the end of a series of graves, a large underground crypt was made.
The original crypt door, which was constructed of steel, seems to have been
pried open.  The large amount of rust on the door suggest that not much force
would have been neccesary to forcefully open the crypt.  It is likely that
grave-robbers are the culprits behind the lock picking.  They were probably in
search of valuables, but any jewelery that may have decorated the inhabitants
of the crypt have likely all been removed by now.

&+yAmidst a Row of&n &+LGrave Stones~
   Gravestones of all shapes and sizes line the small side path here to the
left and right.  The ground before some of the gravestones seems to be dug up,
but from the inside.  &+WBones &nand tattered clothing dot the ground in some
places.  The howling of some angry beast pierces the damp air and the vile
stench of rotting flesh attacks the senses.  Between the fog and the darkness
directions become hard to follow and getting lost becomes easy.

&+yBefore an Immense &+LDead&+y Oak Tree~
   This corner of the graveyard is heavily dominated by an enormous oak tree,
that reaches into the sky, perhaps beyond the thick fog.  Strange shapes seem
to be perched in the branches of the long dead tree.  The shapes seem to appear
and disappear at will.  The tree seems to have been petrified which seems odd
because in this warm humid area, weathering should have claimed this tree to
the soil soon after death.

a gravestone above.  The humid air here stifles normal breathing.  Small vermin
scurry around the floor of this dank room.  The thin earth here has been kept
at bay with large wooden planks which prevent this small antechamber from
collapsing.  A large iron door stands here barring entry to the crypt.

   This appears to be the caretakers shed.  Tools of all kinds line the walls
of the shoddy wooden room.  Hammers, saws, shovels, and a crowbar have been
hung off of nails that were pounded into the thin wooden walls.  Wind creeps
through cracks in the old shed walls and creates an eerie wailing noise which
chills to the bone.  A single desk stands against the western wall, trying
desperately not to succumb to the elements of time.

first sets of graves that were put in the ancient graveyard.  Graves can only
be found on the west side of the row, because a series of dead oak trees decay
on the east side.  The trees have long since lost the ability to grow leaves,
and their barren branches sway in the breeze creaking at every swing.

   The gravestone for this grave has been crumbled over time, or some other
sort of weathering has taken its toll.  The earth feels mushy here, almost like
it is hollow.  The north, west, and southern exits of this area are blocked by
long-dead oak trees.  The howl of a wolf can be heard on occasion, snapping
attention away from the eerie dead end of this very old path of graves.

bury their dead apart from the rest of the commoners.  Well constructed marble
was used to support the walls of this elaborate crypt.  Magical torches have
been lit upon the walls, suggesting that the family had friends adept in the
arts of sorcery.  A polished marble stairway leads up to a well constructed
steel door.  A small &+Bplaque&n adorns the wall here.  The crypt continues to the

&+LA Coffin Lined Crypt~
   Many generations of a family have been buried in this immense crypt which
has been constructed under the graveyard.  The sheer darkness in this area is
overwhelming.  Caskets line the crypt here in four rows, with 3 paths leading
between them.  On further examination, it appears that most of the coffins are
open, and more disturbingly, they are empty.

eldest members of the family occupy or once occupied these final resting areas.

A Small Crypt~
   Polished marble walls lit my magical torches make up the structure of this
crypt.  Four coffins have been placed in each corner of this small mausoleum.
In the east corner of the room, a single alcove has been adorned with a larger,
more ornate coffin.  The coffin in this corner has an inscription which reads:
"Kalyb Fryntok, youngest son of Raydyrn Fryntok, rests here.  Life taken away
far too soon.  He will always be remembered."

An Alcove in a Small Crypt~
   This area of the crypt has been reserved for the master of the Fryntok
family.  Raydyrn Fryntok was well known as a wealthy merchant, and liked by
many who knew him.  Raydyrn's family was slaughtered by a marauding ogre troop
east of the Tharnadian gates.  Raydyrn swore vengeance against all ogres, and
in a fit of rage, he equipped himself with the finest weapons and armor in his
collection and set off for the underdark.  Raydyrn, an accomplished fighter
slew many ogres in the Faang caverns.  His weary body, exhausted from fighting
and riddled with terrible wounds, sustained a death blow from a veteran ogre
guard many hours after beginning his seige on the town of ogres.  His corpse
was recovered days later by a paladin raiding party and brought back to be
buried in this crypt.

&+L   The coffin in the room remains closed.  It has been nailed shut from the
&+Loutside.  The sounds of rhythmic beating on the lid of the coffin from the
&+Linside is barely audible.  The thought of being trapped in a coffin, even as an

&+Ldisturbance in this graveyard, and why?  Further investigation could lead to
&+Lyour death, or worse, the beginning of your undead existence.

which are creating these monstrosities are still unexplained.  It is, however,
obvious why this graveyard seems to have been abandoned.  None of the bodies

this area.  This stone crypt is rather plain, with coffins set in simple rows.

&+yA Path Leading to a Large &+LTomb~
   This small dirt path leads away from the main cemetery path.  It is the only
artery to a large tomb to the south.  A small series of gravestones leaves east
and west from here.  The dirt path leads south up to a door to the largest
crypt in the graveyard.  Strange noises filter out from the tomb to the south.
It is likely, that this building is the epicenter of the chaos that surrounds
this graveyard.

   This small row of gravestones seems to be untouched.  Unlike just about
all of the other graves, these do not seem to be disturbed in any way.  It is
unclear why these bodies have been spared the horror of reincarnation and
necromancy.  Perhaps it has something to do with the mausoleum to the south.

   Torch light is a rare commodity in this large tomb.  Moaning and groaning
sounds come from all around.  Death has been cheated here, and the poor souls
whose bodies have become reanimated are paying the price.  Even the most
oblivious warriors can still feel the powerful magical aura which surrounds
this tomb.  The rough cut floors make travel precarious, and falling in this
area would give the undead here ample opportunity to make an attack.

&+LA Well-Hidden Alcove~
&+L   This small alcove has been well hidden due to the dark lighting in the tomb.
&+LThis room appears to have once been a side crypt room.  No torch light seems
&+Lto reach this alcove, and feeling along the walls seems to be the only way to
&+Lmove about without tripping over the cracked stone floor.

&+LA Small &nAlcove&+L in the Crypt~
   This small alcove has been turned into a sort of laboratory of the dead.
Someone has taken over this room and used it to perform rituals of necromancy
and other hideous black magics.  A small stone altar dominates the center of
the alcove.  Behind the altar is a shelf full of strange liguids and totems of
all kinds.  Scrolls and books also line a second shelf in the southeast corner
of the alcove.  This must certainly be the staging ground for the reanimation
of the graveyard corpses.

&+yOn a Branch of a Petrified Tree~
   This once great oak tree, is now nothing but a hardened statue which towers
above the graveyard below.  The branches are as resistant as the strongest
rocks known in this world.  The dark brown color of the branches suggests that
this tree was once a great oak.  Strange incantations must have solidifed this
tree since it is certainly not old enough to petrify on natural terms.  The
branches of this immense tree can withstand incredible weight.  Exits lead
north and south back to the trunk.
