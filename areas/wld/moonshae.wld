&+gA Little Traveling Path&N~
   This path is the Great Corwell Road it is just a bit on the
deserted side. There looks as if no travelers have came by this
way in a very long time. The over growth of tree's and bushes is
unreal, It is very hard to see, let alone where the woods all around
here might lead.

&+LA Cursed Moonwell&N~
   This little pool of water has an evil aura about it. There is
smooth stone rocks around its walls, with writing on them written
in solidly into the stones. The forest here is almost dead,
with the trees all about twenty feet from the moonwell, making
a perfect circle. The grass is extremely short, and looks
brown. A sensation of death accompanies any who look into the moonwell.
There is no wind or sound whatsoever. There is a path to the south.&N

&+yPath Along The Mountains~
   The path is easier to travel now, But it is still heavy
with vegetation. There is a slight incline due to the huge
mountains viewable from horse top. The mountains sort of lie
hidden from the previous paths that lead here. But there is beauty
beauty among them. There are no sounds around here. The path leads
east and west.

for travellers and their mounts. The view is spectacular, although it is
mostly forest, and fields. There are plenty of berries around to
eat, But none of which look edible. The path continues up the mountain
at a much lesser incline then before. There is a patch of nice soft
grass to rest on.

   The path leads this way for a long time, getting more and more harder
to follow its direction. The Valley is hard to see though all the trees
and overgrowth, this path definitely hasn't been traveled before, and if
it has it was by forest animals. for there are no signs of travel on
it anywhere. The sounds of little animals can be heard scurrying about
from all directions. The path ends here. The only path leads west
down the mountain.

&+YShining Path Through The Mountain&N~
   This little trail is no doubt one of a kind. No matter where
one steps or move aside branches, or leaves, it all seems to go right
back into the original place it was before it was moved. It would be
impossible to follow someone though here without holding their hand.
There is heavy vegetation in all directions and there are
no signs of life other then typical forest life.

You are at the top of the mountain from what you can tell. There is nothing
around you to look out at, it is almost to much for you to believe, since
just a little while ago you could see all of the valley.

floating in the air all around. There is nothing in the wind save

Everything has a light green glow to it that seems to be un dispellable.

rest of the festivals activities and enjoyment. The path is made of

surrounding this moonwell. The stones appear to have been here for
a very very long time. There is absolutely no sound at all in here
and the faintest whisper can be heard with no effort. The stones are
about fifteen feet in the air, and totally surround the sacred druid
moonwell of the earthmother. A feeling of peace comes over one as they
look into the waters of the moonwell, making them feel safe and secure.
