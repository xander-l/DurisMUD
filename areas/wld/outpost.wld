&+LNear the Entrance of an Outpost&N~
    The dirt ground is very solid here as are the walls and ceiling. Light
seems to be coming from all directions with a strange magical glow. While
giving enough light to see, it is not a huge amount which leaves the area
very dim and hard to see for most people. The tunnel continues northwards
where the entrance to an underground entrance can be seen. It is possible
to exit this place upwards.

&+bThe Entrance to a Human Outpost&N~
    This is the entrance to an underground base. Wooden poles can be found
in the room which hold up the ceiling. This is a great structure and
probably took engineers many years to create. The air is rather stale here
from the dust in the air caused by the dirt floor. A finely structured
guard walk extends to the west and east from here. Northwards leads inside
the outpost.

&+bThe Guard Walk&N~
    This is a small guard walk which can occupy a good crowd of humans.
It has been strategically placed so that archers can fire upon people
attempting to enter the outpost while remaining relatively protected.
It is rather dark in here so that the exact position of guards wouldn't
be easily detectable. The only exit is to the east.

&+gA Well-Lit Meeting Room&N~
    This is the entrance to an underground outpost. Magical torches line
the walls filling the room with a dim blue glow. It is very evident that
this outpost was carved from tough rock as large chunks of boulders can
be seen jutting from the wall every so often. It is rather dusty here making
breathing an effort. Tunnels lead to the north, east, and west while the
entrance to the outpost is to the south.

the function of connecting the armory to the rest of the outpost. The air
is very dusty from the walls having been worked on recently. Southwards
leads back to the main entrance of the outpost.

outpost. Here new weapons and armor are forged, and magical items discovered
on raids are also brought here for identification. A counter has been set
up so that visitors to the outpost can buy weapons from the armorer here.
While the outpost generally frowns upon visitors, very rich adventurers
are often welcome here to buy the magical weapons and armor at greatly
inflated prices. Northwards is a thick metal door which probably leads
to something very important while upwards leads back near the outpost.

about five human sized people to walk through side by side as though to
allow quick access during an emergency. The floor consists of smooth packed
dirt however, the walls have rocks jutting out of them as though it was
unfinished. The dusty air makes breathing an effort although it is not

to bend theirs heads down while they walk. Thick oaken doors can be seen

Ornate weapons and Tharnadian symbols can be found on the walls screwed
tightly by thick metal bolts. This area is much cleaner than the rest of

of the soldiers.

found on raids which the soldiers immediately store here. Being a very secure
room, the only exit is to the south through a thick metal door.
