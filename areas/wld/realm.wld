Way of the Faerie~
   This is the Way of the Faerie.  The way continues to become wider
and better paved as one moves to the east, towards the Valley of
Dancing lights.  The Faerie Forest is beginning to recede further back
to south as one approaches the valley.  To the distant north, the
faerie highlands are masked in swirling mists.  Travel is possible to
the east and west along the Way.

      realm, and fewer yet who seek it wantonly.  Be warned now though that
      this is not of your world.  Few here have interest in your existence;
      only those faeries which venture into your world find humans worth their

Beginning of the Way of the Faerie~
   You blink with amazement at the world around you.  Reality seems to
have changed.  Images seem much sharper now, sounds clearer... this is
definitely a place of magic.  The forest to the north and south seems
to extend endlessly; there is no navigable way through that forest.
The trees tower thousands of feet into the air, their leaves
shimmering magically in vibrant hues of green, silver and gold.  To
the west is the safety of the clearing, to the east is the Way, wide
and paved haphazardly with white stones.

either.  Through the depths of the upper forest, you can see that the
tree branches interlink to form vast pathways which the faeries can
travel.  The light is getting brighter as the path moves up beyond the
hazy light of the forest bellow.  The path travels gradually downward
to the west, and makes another sharp climb up towards the east.

top canopy of the Faerie Forest.  Like the byways the branches make
within the depths of the forest, the overlapping crowns of the trees
seem to be ways of travel for that of the faerie.  The sun is very
bright now that you are above the hazy light of the forest.  The sky
is a vibrant blue and filled with birds and creatures of flight; all
around you singing and buzzing and whooping in their graceful flights.
The path continues up the hill, and down towards the forest floor.

Atop a Large Hill Within the Faerie Forest~
   After the long climb up the hill you ogle in awe at the view around
you.  This is the highest point of the hill and offers a panoramic
view of the world around you in all directions.  The enormity of the
world is mind boggling.  For as far as you can see the Faerie Forest
extends; there doesn't seem to be really an end to it, just spots
where the forest gives way to clear spaces of meadows, valleys, and
hills.  In no direction is there a familiar object from your world.
The forest is alive with sounds of movement and life.  All sights and
sound blend to become a symphony of wonders to the senses.  There are
two paths leading down the hill one to the west, the other to the
east.  To the south there appears to be a small glade of trees which
couldn't bee seen before on the way up the hill.  To the north is a
steep drop and open air into the skies above.

south, through the trees to tumble down the hill bellow.  The grounds
around the trees are well kept; not a dead leaf or twig can be found
in the area.  The wind rustles musically through the leaves of the
trees, and you find yourself becoming relaxed in such a beautiful

shimmer in a light of their own, but at best it is still very dim
here.  All bearing or direction was lost upon entering the forest, and

In the Midst of Tinkers~
   You emerge from the Forest of the Faerie into what seems to be a
natural clearing, with your eyes wincing.  Even in the dim light of
the forest, the garish colors of the Tinker wagons an eyesore.  It
would make sense now finding Tinkers unheedingly camping in the Faerie
Forest; they care little about harm or even self-preservation, their
nomadic life quest is to find their lost Song from an age gone by.
The camp is a small one, and you suddenly wonder how the Tinkers,
people of your world, found the Realm of the Fays.  To the west is an
open Tinker wagon. To the south and west you can see the warm glows of
campfires and hear the merry melodies of Tinker songs.  To the north

A Tinker Wagon~
   The Tinker wagon assaults the aesthetics of color coordination with
a skill that is mind boggling.  Painted green cupboards adorn yellow
walls.  Purple with and orange polka-dotted-quilts cover a wooden,
mauve bedframe.  Pink chairs sit placidly around a dark blue table.
Your eyes reel in the technicolor nightmare.  There is an exit to
relative sanity to the east.  To the west is a door leading to the
other side of the wagon.

   There is a campfire here with Tinkers clustered around it dancing
and singing songs of their ancestry.  They are at the same time
cheerful yet sad; singing songs expressing the emotion of nomadic
exiles from society, searching for the Song.  The camp continues to
the east and to the north.  To the south sits a wagon that looks like
it plowed into a rainbow and kept on going.

   You are in a Tinker wagon which strives to offend your sense of

   This is within the midst of a Tinker camp, relaxing among the
cheerful nature of Tinkers.  The Tinkers revere life and hold it
sacred.  The Tinkers abhor weapons and fighting, and look with
disapproving glances at your monster survival gear.  You could try
explaining to them that without such handy devices as a sword and
shield, you wouldn't be here today to enjoy their company and fire,
but then decide it's just not worth the effort.  The Tinker camp
spreads north and west of here.

   This is a typical garishly decorated Tinker wagon.  What is not so
typical about the wagon, though, is it seems to be a shop of sorts
with Fulbar, a rather rotund and hairy Tinker, ready to help any
shopper.  Mended pots and other items of interest adorn the walls.
You can browse your purchase before buying it by simply looking at it

is not much larger than the other Tinker wagons, and is painted in the

Guhan's desk of large and sturdy oak is untouched by color.  Guhan is
here shuffling through papers, lost in the duties of a Tinker leader.

   The path on the eastern side of the hill gradually slopes down at a
much gentler angle than the path up the west side.  From here one can
see the entire layout of the land east of here.  Towards the east, the
path leads into a hilly, unforested highland, which is just north of a
large broad valley to the distant southeast of here.  The path leads

the Way of the Faerie.  The terrain looks treacherous from here to the
Way, full of jagged rocks sticking out at unexpected spots.
Attempting to travel down that would mean stretching ones luck too
far.  To the north, beyond the hill, the Faerie Forest looms
impenetrably. To the east the path levels out as it enters the hilly
highlands north of the Valley of Dancing Lights.  The path also

the walls of the cottage seem to be grow right out of the oak trees.
The branches of the four, towering oak trees, grow so close together
they seem to form the roof of the cottage.  One cannot begin to fathom

crystal.  The air inside is sweet and fragrant, reminiscent of dried
flowers and spiced wood.  The entry hallway leads north.  The door out

soft, spongy moss.  The walls are made of flowing, living wood, and look so
natural that one would suspect that the walls formed this way as a freak of
nature.  The hallway continues north and south.  To the east another small

the roof creating patterns of shadow and light upon the mossy carpet.
Being closer to the roof of the cottage from this vantage point, you
are amazed by the structure.  The branches and leaves seem to be
frozen in time, perfectly still, and magically encased within sheets
of crystal.  The whole spectacle is dazzling to the eye, as sunlight
enters through the roof and refracts through the crystal and leaves,
shattering the light into shards of light and shadows of leaves.
There is a door to the east and a huge archway in the wall to the

a product of nature.  The huge four-poster bed seems to be growing
right out of the floor.  The nightstand, dresser and chairs all are
made of one flowing piece of wood; it is hard to discern whether or
not they are separate objects from the house.  There is a window made

OBERON, GOD OF FAYS:
   Before mortal history Oberon watched over the faeries, and in
particularly loved the elves.  He was peaceful and loved all faeries
alike and never understood why the Unseelie and Seelie fays could
never end their fighting.  Oberon was slain by the demon Wervnod,
ruler of the Underdark realm, summoned by the chaotic Unseelie in
their quest to destroy.  The ancient city of Gaelis, home of the elves
within the Faerie Realm was destroyed in the ensuing battle.  Celriya,
was the only one of the elves to remain in the Faerie Realm after the
elves had decided to depart to the mortal planes.
   Oberon's temple was built within the heart of the now lost city of
Gaelis; the temple now is in ruins now, surrounded by a beautiful
garden.

done if Oberon had not been slain and the elves had not left.  Celriya
was the only elf of those who lived in Gaelis to stay behind in the
Realm of the Faeries; she awaits the day that Oberon will return and
bring life back to the elvish heartland.
   She is said also to be searching for a sign that her bloodline

what was the elvish heartland.  The elves sick beyond grief at the

FAERIE FOREST:
   A forest which mortals should not enter unless they intend to spend

don't understand its many ways and paths.  The forest is the defining
characteristic of this realm; its magic and existence is the soul of
this realm.  If the forest should ever die, then magic and faeries
would most likely disappear entirely.

POLITICS:
   A mortal convention which was introduced to the faeries by the
elves.  Since that time the fays have been of the Unseelie Court,
Seelie Court, or refused the mortal politics, and are considered
Solitary or Trooping Faeries.  The Solitary Faeries are often fays
which prefer their own company.  Trooping Faeries are those which do
not really think one way or another about the two Courts and simply do
whatever they do.  They often venture into the mortal world and create
havoc or fortune wherever they go.
   It is interesting to note though that the elves became so sick of
living among the warring Seelie and Unseelie, and in great grief at
the death of Oberon, and the destruction of their city Gaelis, the
elves left the Realm of Faeries to join mortal existence.

what mortals consider the more aesthetic qualities of life: singing,
dancing, beauty, pleasure, etc.  The Seelie do not often mind

the order which Queen Mab had eternally held, several years ago.  The

perhaps the Tinkers' quest is so great that it drew an entire group at
once to this place of wishes and magic.

faeries faerie fay fays~
FAERIES, FAYS:
   Beings of magic and life.  They are the immortal concepts of nature
and magic embodied in the form of a live, physical body.  Faeries
don't really fit any concept of size or shape.  They often are whoever
they want to be.  They have received mortal names such as 'changlings'
because of this fact.  Many have a certain state they enjoy most; and
others feel most akin to certain magicks or nature.  They are often
categorized this way.  Water faeries, wood sprites, nymphs, gnomes,
sylphs... all are examples of names which have been given to faeries
because of their geographic orientation.
   Faeries are immortal in that as long as there is nature and magic
there will be faeries.  Mortals struggle with this concept, because
faeries do not posses a soul that moves on after the death of its
physical state.  Rather the faerie simply 'is' once again.  The
transformation from magical or natural essence to that of a physical
form is beyond the scope of this entry.

A Cozy Den in the Oak Tree Cottage~
   This is a small room which looks to serve like a private place of
reading and relaxation.  There is a large couch, which looks very
comfortable to rest on, in the east corner.  The roof, walls and floor
here are all made of the living wood which permeates the house.  There
is an aromatic smell to the room like that of dried flowers and herbs.
There are no windows or light coming from the outside; the walls
themselves seem to glow with their own light.

  The smells of fresh baked pies and warm bread fill the air here.  A
huge oven is immediately noticeable, made completely of stone filling
up most of the western side of the wall.  From the walls hang all
sorts of vegetables, herbs, dried fruit, and such.  There are several
tables to prepare meals on here, and a large table where one could sit
and eat the rewards of ones effort.  There are windows to the north
made of the same crystal that the ceiling is made of and a door
leading out of the cottage as well.  To the south, there is a hallway.

the darkness, waiting for the foolish traveler to return.  The walls
of the tunnel pulse with a dim magical light.  Carved into the dirt
walls you are many fiery, blue runes of magic, placed around the room;
symbols of warding.  A group of adventurers must have made it this far
to safeguard the room against the power of the oak tree cottage.  The
whole room is filled with warring magic powers: the runes fighting off
the affects of the cottage, the cottage trying to destroy the barriers
erected within its domain. On the wall above a rotting corpse a
message can be seen, scrawled into the wall along with the runes, To
the east there is an eerie green glow of light, leading into another
chamber.

           GO BACK NOW... We have created the runes to protect
          those who made it this far.  My companions have left
             into the next chamber    many days ago... I was to await
            their arrival because I was too weak to follow.
   I    am   dying    now.... This was such a foolish quest......

Chamber of the Tree Spirit~
   Upon entering the room, the exit immediately closed itself off by
slamming tons of earth between this room and the mud pit.
   This is a huge dry chamber that is bathed in an eerie green glow.
You notice immediately a towering creature occupying most of the room.
It is the essence, the being, of the oak tree cottage.  The being
hesitates only slightly before destroying you for defiling his domain,
and challenging his power.

Up an Oak Tree~
   Climbing through the thick, leafy branches of the giant oak tree is
no easy task; this is a hard climb!  This is halfway up the tree,
about eye level with the roof of the oak tree cottage.  Up or down is

   Climbing up the oak tree is a rough trip of scraped flesh and

more poky tree branches to get to the top.  From this point nothing
can really be seen except an abundance of leaves and bark.  From

a couple of the monstrous branches can be followed to the west and

   This branch from the oak tree extends north out into the clearing
in the Faerie Forest.  The Faerie Forest looms far above you, even
from this height.  The trees in the forest are so gigantic that each
looks like a tower which would take any human hundreds of years to
build if made of stone.  The branches of the towering faerie trees are
so interlinked and entwined that it would be possible to travel
through the forest without even touching the ground.  The branch leads
back to the trunk of the tree to the south.

your head.  This oak tree still doesn't even come close to the height
of the rest of the Faerie Forest, a fact which is more than a little

make up the road are pitted and worn down by the elements.  So few
stones remain on the roadway that this seems more of a natural track
through the forest than something that was made.  The forest looms to

pool water waters reflection~
You look deeper into the pool...
   Your mind suddenly explodes with lights and images.  Your vision
becomes grey and dim.  You open your eyes and realize that you are in
the same place, but at a different time....

   This is the temple, but fully intact.  You know that this is a time
long past, in ages before mortal history...  Suddenly the sky grows
dark, and from seemingly nowhere hoards of the evil Unseelie faerie
appear within the grounds of the temple.
   You look again, and you know you are seeing this through the eyes
of Oberon, God of Fays.  ...The elven city!  The Unseelie surely must
have destroyed it in reaching my temple... You can see the virtuous
elves among the throng, desperately trying to fight of the Unseelie.
   Magic crackles across the sky.  Battles of magic and might can be
heard booming in the distant forest from here ...The elves! Who dares
this affrontry to my domain, my people, my peace!!... You look over
the now teeming garden of evil faeries and elves and see the demon
Wervnod, laughing at you.  Your anger mounts to a fury, as you realize
the chaotic faeries had sunk so low as to summon the evils of the
Underdark to help them in this insanity.
   With a sneer you summon the essence of your magic and hurl it full
force at Wervnod.  Most of the temple explodes around you at the force
of unleashing such power.  Wervnod is only knocked down.  Within a
leap you are upon him, battering him with mighty club Hammerwood which
magically sprang into your hand at the sight of Wervnod.  Wervnod, in
a display of sheer power rocks your world as he smacks you off of him;
you feel your body soar into the air and land crashing into the broken
elven city of Gaelis.  You look up and see Wervnod coming down upon
you from the sky....

Your head snaps back and you blink.  The images are gone but the memory
is not...

Ruins of Oberon's Temple~
   This is the remains of the temple of Oberon, God of the Fays.
Fallen marble columns and crumbling stone walls are all the is left of
this temple.  There is a reflection pool here which extends all the
way west to the other entrance of the temple.  The pool reflects
little... but something magical stirs within its waters.  The temple
ruins extend to the south and east of here.  To the east are steps
leading down the grassy lawn into the garden.

pool waters water reflection~
You look deeper into the pool...
Images and sounds suddenly fill your mind.  Your vision becomes cloudy
and dim, and then black.

   You open your eyes again and you are in the same place, but at a
different time... far into the past.  You look around and see more
than just the ruins of the temple.  The entire landscape has been
devastated.  Bodies are in heaps and piled all around, the smell of
fire and blood is thick in the air.
   You know you are Celriya, once keeper of the temple grounds.  At
your feet lies the body of Oberon slayed by Wervnod, in his attempts
to purge the demon from Realm of Faeries.  Oberon was successful, but
for the price of reimprisoning the demon in the Underdark, it
destroyed him.  Now the elves of Gaelis, what is left of them, stand
before you.  They talk of leaving the Faerie Realm, of joining the
mortals within their realm.  They are sick of the warring Seelie and
Unseelie, a battle which will never be won.  They have strayed far
from their faerie blood, they long to leave this realm and seek peace
elsewhere.  Few are willing to stay and rebuild.  You mourn bitterly
at what has happened but there is nothing to do.... time passes.
   Now you are the only one of the elves to have stayed.  The others
have all left or faded into the darkness of the forest, so filled with
grief, unable to go on living among the ruins of their once great
city.  The garden is growing back, but slowly, it will take much time
for the evil of what despoiled it to be cleansed from the land, you
sigh and weep silently...

You blink and you are back within your own time.  The images of the
pool are gone, but the memories are not.  So this is what became of the
elves, so this is how they came into the world of mortals....

   The walls of the temple still stand tall here.  Parts of the heavy
stone roof somehow are still held in place.  Debris of time worn
marble and stone lie across the floor in gigantic mounds.  To the

   The room is dark and small.  This is the first breath of life this

of a mammoth marble crypt on an elevated dais in the center of the
room.  This room feels sacred and the presence of any mortals defiling
to the honor of Oberon.  Perhaps you should leave.

stand fairly high and parts of the roof are somehow still in place
overhead.  Little can be seen of the temple now.  Time and its
ruination have destroyed much of the beauty of the place.  There is a
heavy sense of sorrow even now among the ruined remains of the temple.

Trail Through the Light Woods~
   This trail seems to have been made for people a lot shorter than
two feet.  The trail is well formed and clear to see on the ground,
but overhanging limbs and shrubbery make it hard to move through the
forest.  Smaller trees grow around this path, the towering trees of
the Faerie Forest have receded to the north. The forest is peaceful
here, and little is left of the oppression and gloom of the Faerie
Forest to the north. The song of birds fill the air, and a gentle
breeze can be felt moving among the trees.  The trail continues to
east and south, and to the west, back onto the old roadway.

intention of only people less than two feet would be able to walk it
easily.  The forest is alive with the sounds of life.  The woods
around the path are full of light and the trees grow far enough apart
to that glades and clearings are common.  The trail continues to the

civilization are long gone.  All that remains are the crumbling

broken stone, which looked like it might have served as a palace one
day, but is now completely decimated.  To the distant north the Way of

seem to lift even in the bright light of the sun.

Way of the Faerie~
  This is the Way of the Faerie.  To the east a towering archway of
stone marks the entrance of the way into the valley.  A small wall of
white stone rings the valley, seemingly more symbolic then protective.
The way continues to the east towards the Valley of Dancing Lights and
to the west.

Under the Great Stone Arch~
   This is under a great stone archway which towers into the sky above
you.  Birds high above you wield through the skies and land on the
arch using it as a lofty perch.  The stone arch marks the entrance
into the Valley of the Dancing lights.  The way continues to the west
away from the shining valley below.

arch stone archway~
This towering structure serves as a marker of the entrance into the valley
below.  It is made completely from stone, seemingly carved from one giant
piece of rock.  It looks old and weathered, ancient beyond any stone structure
you've seen before.
