&+LBeyond the &+cNorthern Gates&+L of Barovia&N~
   &+LJust south of here sit the northern gates of the village of Barovia.
&+LFrom here, an old and battered road that is very frequently completely
&+Lcovered in fallen &+yleaves&+L, winds north into the forest before
&+Lclimbing up a large hillside.  East of here can be seen the towering
&+Lspires of Castle Ravenloft, overshadowing the village of Barovia like
&+Lan elephant and a mouse.

&+LA Gravel Highway &+gCovered in Leaves&N~
   &+LThis large highway sprawls through the rolling hillside of the Barovia
&+Lvalley.  The Svalich woods to the south almost consume the now-distant
&+Lvillage.  The road continues further northward, and northeastern on the
&+Lhorizon, one can see the path is all uphill towards the Castle, and
&+Ldownhill back towards the village.  Leaves from the looming trees of the
&+LSvalich Woods blanket the entire area, as well as a dark and chilling mist.

   This cliffside overlooks the Svalich woods below here, which become
denser and denser around the village of Barovia.  The village is almost
impossible to see from this vantage point without the aid of farsight,
due to the tallness of the Svalich Woods as well as the dark mists
that blanket the realm of Barovia.  North of here a mountain pass
finds its way into a large cave, which appears to be well-guarded.

A Rope Bridge of &+yWooden &NPlanks&N~
   This rope bridge swings dangerously over the rapids of the Tser
river below.  This location bares the rubble and debris on either
bank suggesting that at one time a stone bridge stood strongly over
this bridge, but has since crumbled and been replaced by a rope
bridge.  The planks are old and warped, but look to be native wood
from the Svalich Woods.  The fine hemp rope used to build this
bridge was either purchased from an outsider to Barovia, or taken
from them.  Although not beautifully maintained, this rope bridge
still functions and serves its purpose across the Tser river.

&+LA Gravel Highway&N North of a Bridge&N~
   &+yThis is the only road that wraps through the great wilderness
&+yof Barovia.  Leaves litter the ground, but do not mask the road
&+ycompletely.  Grass has overgrown most of the road, which has been
&+ybeaten a few lenghts into the ground.  A dark mist settles upon
&+ythe area, blocking farsight through much of the surrounding
&+yareas, which imposes an element of paranoia and readiness upon
&+ythe chests of any of those brave enough to venture further towards
&+ythe castle of the first vampire.

&+BThe Tser River&N~
   &+BWild raging rapids of fresh water come crashes across
&+Bnumerous rocks and splashing all around, leaving a
&+Bfrothy white foam.  The rapids of the Tser river
&+Bcollect in the Tser Pool before cascading down west-
&+Bward through the Tser river and eventually out of
&+Bthe great valley of Barovia.  This river runs deep,
&+Bseperating Lysaga Hill and the northern portion of
&+Bthe Barovia from the southern portion, which includes
&+Bthe Svalich Woods and the village.

&+gwind, gently carressing the valley floor of Barovia.  From this

&+gthe lower portions of the valley have lifted somewhat, making it
&+geasier to see.  However, a gloomy and dark presence still clutches

&+LA Rocky Ascent &+gOn Lysaga Hill&N~
   &+gThe forest parts around a large hill, a spur of bare rock
&+gjutting up from the earth.  Near the hill's highest point, one

&+LThe Entrance to the Tower of the Mountain Fane~
   &+LOn this point of Lysaga Hill, the entrance to a small, but
&+Lancient stone tower rests.  Although the &+ydoor&+L to the tower
&+Lhas completely deteriorated, the stone supports of the tower
&+Lhave withstood the test of time.  This ancient tower was once a
&+Lproud sanction of a great wizardess in the realm of Barovia.
&+LThe rumored &+rMountain Fane&+L resides in this dismal dwelling,
&+Ltwisted and warped with long life from the powerful corruptive
&+Lmagics spewing from Castle Ravenloft itself.

&+rThe Tower of the Mountain Fane&N~
   &+rThe tower of the mountain faine, a once proud and illustriously-
&+rdecorated tower of the great Baba Zelenna, sage princess and
&+rsoothsayer of the Barovia people, has been warped and twisted
&+rinto this vacant, dismal tower of the Mountain Fane.  The tower
&+rstands strong without a single creek of wood, which has rotted
&+raway hundreds of years ago.  This entire area, along with all
&+rof Lysaga Hill, is blanketed in a dark mist from its close
&+rperimeter to Castle Ravenloft, the source of the evil.

&+WThe Dilapidated Domain of Baba Zelenna&N~
   &+WThis small wizard's study, resting atop of this tower, has
&+Wbeen completed dilapidated over the years, yet is still in
&+Wwhat appears to be frequent use.  A pile of sheets and random
&+Wbits of clothing from all over the realm are scattered in the
&+Wfar corner of this room.  A small ancient Svalich Wood desk,
&+Waged to the point of petrification, rests on the western side.
&+WThe entire desk is covered with all sorts of notes and scrolls,
&+Wscribbled on haphazardly.  The most common word written on
&+Wthese pieces of paper debris is '&+RChernovog&+W' appearing numerous
&+Wtimes on some.  This study, and whatever magical practices it was
&+Wstudied within in the past, has been 'renovated' into the
&+Wfilthy cell of a madly-insane mountain recluse.

   &+WThis high mountain summit stands above the black haze shadowing
&+Wthe entire valley of Barovia.  From this point, the Castle of
&+WStrahd stands directly to the south, while the rocky descent

&+Wvantage point, the village of Barovia is quite small, almost
&+Wcompletely encompassed by the Svalich Woods.  The distant howl
&+Wof wolves can be heard echoing through the wilderness below,
&+Wwhile the monolithic &+rCastle Ravenloft&+W, standing directly south
&+Wof here, overshadows the entire valley with an ominous omnipotence.
   &+WFrom this vantage point, this is probably the best &+Cview&+W of

   This small grassy egress at the peak of Mount Ravenloft rests
just west of the upper echelon of the Tser River, flowing gently
through a small ravine through these mountain peaks.  The grass
in this area is soft and gentle, much shorter then the hay-like
yellow-grass blowing throughout the valley floor of Barovia.

&+rThese gates are very sturdy and completely unbreakable.  There

&+LBarovia2 Main Dispersement Room~
There's 3 "tiers" of the main valley of Barovia.  They can be referred to
as tier 1 - tier 3, numbered respectively for which are encountered first.

Exits N/S/SE 	-	Tier 1
Exits E/W/NE/NW	-	Tier 2
Exits U/D 	- 	Tier 3

Tier 2 is the largest of the three, so it gets two extra exits for mobs to
disperse to, while Tier 3 has the smallest, so it only gets two.  Tier 1 is
pretty cool too.
