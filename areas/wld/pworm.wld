&+mA Large Crack In the Cavern Wall&n~
       A huge crack in the cavern wall of the underdark is situated here.
The crack seems to ooze with a purple slime, and is quite huge.  It's
possible that this crack leads into a whole new section of the underdark.
There's just enough room for someone to slip through this crack if they
moved a few rocks.

&+mThe Great Tracks of the Gargantuan Purple Worm&n~
    The great tracks of the gargantuan purple worm are one of the most
feared tunnels ever dug in the entire underdark.  Unlike most purple
worms, this one is gargantuan, digging a tunnel larger than any others
in the entire underdark as it burrows. The dimensions of the tunnel are
so great one could create a stack of ten ogres tall before even reaching
the ceiling of the tunnel. The walls are smooth, created by the worm's
digging techniques.  In addition to the ooze left in the worm's trail,
the area is littered with humungeous deposits of worm droppings and
crushed underdark creatured who got in teh way. To the sides of the
cavern, every so often a smaller tunnel swizzles out, dug out by a
small purple worm, perhaps an infant.

    This small circular tunnel, much like the gargantuan purple worm
tunnel is circular, and contains its share of crushed vermin as the
baby worms burrow around.  The walls are a little rougher than that
of the gargantuan purple worm, and there isn't quite as much ooze
left behind from the infants.

     This large cave appears to be the breeding grounds where eggs
are laid.  Many small baby purple worms lie about here, sleeping as
they have just come out of their eggs most likely, and will soon be
looking to devour something, as all purple worms are hungry almost
all of their entire lives.

&+mThe Great Tracks of the Gargantuan Purple Worm&n~
    The great tracks of the gargantuan purple worm are one of the most
feared tunnels ever dug in the entire underdark.  Unlike most purple
worms, this one is gargantuan, digging a tunnel larger than any others
in the entire underdark as it burrows. The dimensions of the tunnel are
so great one could create a stack of ten ogres tall before even reaching
the ceiling of the tunnel. The walls are smooth, created by the worm's
digging techniques.  In addition to the ooze left in the worm's trail,
the area is littered with humungeous deposits of worm droppings and
crushed underdark creatured who got in teh way. To the sides of the
cavern, every so often a smaller tunnel swizzles out, dug out by a
small purple worm, perhaps an infant.

&+MInside the Gargantuan Worm&n~
     This must be the most nausiating place to be in the entire
realm of Duris, as once inside the worm you are constantly trying
to be digested and squeezed out.  A few brave warriors have tried to
use their weapons to slash their way out, but haven't been able to
cut through the final layer of the tough hide. The worm's body
continues to the north.

    The tunnel comes to an abrupt end here, as the gargantuan purple

lash out at anyone disturbing its nap.  One can enter the belly of
the worm by being eaten or by heading northward.

&+mA Large Cave&n~
     This large cave appears to be the breeding grounds where eggs
are laid.  Many small baby purple worms lie about here, sleeping as
they have just come out of their eggs most likely, and will soon be
looking to devour something, as all purple worms are hungry almost
all of their entire lives.

&+MInside The Gargantuan Worm&n~
     This must be the most nausiating place to be in the entire
realm of Duris, as once inside the worm you are constantly trying

use their weapons to slash their way out, but haven't been able to
cut through the final layer of the tough hide. The worm's body
continues to the north.
