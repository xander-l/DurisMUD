&+L   Stretching out before you is a large mass of pitch black rock. Floating
&+Lwithin the silvery void, this mass of rock seems to have been ripped from
&+Lsome far off plane and forgotten. Stretching out for nearly a mile, this
&+Llandmass seems to have become the dwelling place of some sort. Pillars
&+Lcan be seen dotting the land scape and in the distance their appears to

&+Gbeen brought here from somewhere on the prime material plane. Towering
&+Gover the courtyard are massive &+Lebonwood &+Gand &+rjodani &+Gtree's. As you look
&+Gup, only the lush canopy can be seen above.&n
