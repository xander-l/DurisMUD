  &+WYou find yourself in an open space with vague lighting and
&+Wa soft breeze travels west.  The room is neither bright or dim,
&+Wbut allows clear sight without glare or shadow.  It is hard to
&+Wkeep bearings here.. there is no clear surface to walk on.. and
&+Wa fine mist obscures visibility above.  There is no clear path
&+Wto follow.. but the breeze seems to be constant in both force
&+Wand direction.

&+YA Small Alcove Between the Great Pillars~
  &+yThis small alcove between the mighty pillars is a perfect
&+yplace to stop and reflect.  A small, comfortable bench is set
&+yhere to provide a place to do just that.  The air here is softer
&+yand the light is less brilliant.  This place is perfect for
&+yrelaxation and thinking.  From the bench it is easy to study
&+ythe stories of the great pillars and it is equally easy to get
&+ylost in daydream as the stories of the pillars come alive.

&+WThe Door to Bahamut's Receiving Room~
  &+yBeyond this door is the room where Bahamut receives guests
&+yand emissaries.  The door is made of the same bronze as the
&+ythe great pillars, and swings open from the middle.  The door
&+yto this room is heavily guarded by Silver dragons and is not
&+yeasy to pass without invite.  The door itself is without decor
&+yand is hinged on both sides to the misty walls.  On each door
&+yis a huge &+Wloop of Silver &+ythat is used by the guards to pull
&+ythem open when the occasion arises.  By the looks on the faces
&+yof the guards, right now is not one of those occasions.

  &+WThis is the room where Bahamut receives his guests and those
&+Wemissaries that request to be heard.  The room is spartan and
&+Wmajestic, with pillars of purest white marble rising into nothing.
&+WIn the center of room against the back wall is the throne where
&+WBahamut sits while welcoming visitors.  The throne seems to be made
&+Wfor a human form, but just like everything else here, that may
&+Wonly be because Bahamut wills it to be so right now.  The throne
&+Wlooks to be made of solid carved gypsum, with gold inlay.  The
&+Wgypsum shimmers in the light with a golden aura, capturing every
&+Weye in the vicinity.  The Flagstones are of white marble with
&+Wgold tracery.  If there ever were a room with a greater air of
&+Wmajesty and dignity, it is not known in the mortal realm.

&+WThe Beginning of a Small Path~
  A small path seems to start here leading in an easterly direction.
The path is only recognizable because there are small chunks of white
marble marking both sides of the path.  The ground is covered in the same
fine mist that pervades this whole place.  Without the stone markers it
would be impossible to tell any difference in this place from the vast
spaces all around.

&+WThe G&+wat&+We &+wto The &+WCi&+wta&+Wdel &+wof &+WBahamut~
   &+WOut of the fine white mist that flows through this area rises a gate.
&+WThe gate at first seems to be just another series of trailers in the
&+Wmist... but on closer examination, it is clear that the gate is made
&+Wof the purest white marble.  The gate is simple and relatively
&+Wunadorned. The gate serves only as a marker.. for those who dwell beyond
&+Wthis gate have no need to fear any foolish enough to pass.  The path
&+Wcontinues through this area and seems to lead into the Citadel proper.  On
&+Weach side of the gate the mist seems to consolidate slightly..although it
&+Wis clear that anyone could still clearly pass through it if they had a
&+Wmind to.  Except for the gate and the marked path.. there is no
&+Wevidence to suggest that this place is anywhere special.

gate marble~
  The gate is made of the purest white marble.  the design of the gate is
much as you would expect to find in any castle or estate.  Marble spires
are joined by a frame that form wings which open in the center.  Strangely
enough the gate seems to be hinged directly in the mist on each side of
the gate.  The gate opens silently and quite easily for any who wish to
enter.

Inside the Gate~
  Once inside the gate the Citadel is clearly visible.  It is a tower of
mist that shimmers in the eternal twilight, shifting yet somehow the
outline never changes.  The walls are opaque but it looks as if they aren't
quite solid.  Taken as a whole, the entire structure seems to be an
illusion..as if it would disappear as soon as you enter.
There is a courtyard directly east from here which appears sparse yet
elegant with a fountain directly in the center.  The floor of the courtyard
seems to be paved with the same white marble the gate is made of.

&+WPath Into the Citadel~
 &+WThe path widens and straightens here leading into the citadel.  The
&+Wmist seems to clear some here and more things come into focus.  The light
&+Wis still vague and unfocused..but more detail can be seen here.  The floor
&+Wof the path is still mostly covered in a fine mist, yet white
&+Wmarble peeks up from time to time through the shroud.  To the east is a
&+Wcourtyard of precise dimension and symmetry.  Beyond, the walls of mist
&+Wthat make up the citadel can be seen rising into obscurity.

&+wThe paving stones in this courtyard are made of the white marble seen

&+wstatues of pearl and marble tucked into inset arches very precisely spaced
&+walong the walls of the courtyard.  the courtyard itself is uncluttered and
&+Wis decorated only with a large fountain set directly in the center.  The
&+Wfountain seems to be made of many different types of metals.  Among the

&+WAn Elegant, Ma&+wrb&+Wle Courtyard~
 &+WThe courtyard is a perfect square with doors centered on each wall.
&+wThe paving stones in this courtyard are made of the white marble seen
&+weverywhere in this place.. but they are veined with silver streaks that
&+Wsparkle in the vague lighting.  This courtyard seems the very definition
&+wof symmetry and harmony.  Everything is simple yet elegant, with small
&+wstatues of pearl and marble tucked into inset arches very precisely spaced
&+walong the walls of the courtyard.  the courtyard itself is uncluttered and
&+Wis decorated only with a large fountain set directly in the center.  The
&+Wfountain seems to be made of many different types of metals.  Among the
&+wmost easily discerned at first glance are silver, gold, copper, and brass.

&+WThe Ce&+wnt&+Wer of the Co&+wurty&+Ward~
  &+WThis is the very center of the courtyard.  A large fountain sits here
&+Wgently gurgling clear, cool water.  The fountain is circular and perfectly
&+wsymmetrical on all sides.  The flagstones here are streaked with silver
&+Wflecks and are warm to the touch.  The mist that has shrouded everything
&+where is gone and the courtyard is bathed in a warm diffuse light.
&+WThere is a crystal clarity of sight here that allows true appreciation of
&+Wthe elegance and symmetry of the courtyard is all aspects.

&+ySpartan Yet &+wEl&+geg&+want &+yGuest Quarters~
 These quarters are for guests that are not expected or are not quite
important enough to be housed in the citidel proper.  It is however no
insult to have a room in these quarters, considering this is one of the
most honored houses in all the known planes.  The quarters are sparse, yet
elegant in a fashion that can only be attributed to the magic and power of

&+WAt the Gate to the Citadel~
  &+WHere is the gate to the mighty citadel.  The gate is made of
&+Wplatinum and is roughly sixty feet high or more.  The value of
&+wthe gate is beyond measure or reason, and is a good indication of
&+wthe raw power wielded by the mighty &+WBahamut.  &+wInscribed
&+Winto the door are many runes and pictures, some parts telling
&+wstories of the deeds done by the mighty king, and some parts are
&+wpowerful wards to help protect and bless this place.  The gates
&+Wmust weigh more than anyone could possibly imagine, but they
&+Wseem to be hinged on mist, and open soundlessly to a slight touch.

torches that never seem to dim or fade.  Inset into the walls are
&+Wsmall arched niches that house small &+ystatues &+wand &+rartifacts.
&+wThe hallways are silent yet they seem to ring with a harmonious tone
that permeates the air all around.  There is a majesty here that cannot

  &+bThis is the private office of &+YGrindlor.  &+bThe office,
&+blike everything else in this place, is clean and somewhat tidy.
&+bThis place however has a look that says it is used only seldom,
&+bas the owner very rarely leaves his post at the gate.  Simple
&+band functional furnishings dominate this room except for a small
&+bshelf that sits on one of the walls which holds a few mementoes
&+bof &+YGrindlor's &+blife before he took on the duty given him
&+bby &+WBahamut.

&+BHall of Guard~
  &+bThis is a hallway leading to the &+lVault of the Damned.
&+bNoone is allowed here unless specifically ordered by &+WBahamut.
&+bThe hallway here is clean and straight, with very little
&+badornment save some VERY powerful &+gwards &+bthat help keep
&+bthe evil beings imprisoned in the vault.

&+BGate To the Vault of the Damned~
  &+WThis is the Gate of the Vault where Bahamut has imprisoned those
&+REvil &+Wbeings that he has captured.  Noone is to enter this vault
&+Wexcept by the consent of Bahamut himself.  The &+Revil &+wbeings
&+Winside are not kept in cells.. instead they are kept in one huge
&+Wvault that has been &+GWarded &+wby the most skilled mages known.
&+WThe &+LVault of the Damned &+Wis perhaps the most dangerous of places
&+Wthis side of &+RH&+rel&+Rl.

&+MA Small Alcove Off the Main Hallway.~
  &+mThis is a small alcove off of the main hallway that spreads
&+mthrough the citidel.  There is a small bench here for those who
&+mwould like to just sit and think.  The walls are of softly lit
&+mrose marble that provides a very relaxing atmosphere.  There are
&+mfine inscriptions on the walls telling of adventures and deeds of
&+mages long forgotten, in kingdoms that have long since turned to
&+mdust.  As relaxing as it is in this small sanctuary, there is no
&+mforgetting the awesome power that resides here, and the very walls
&+mare willing to remind anyone of that fact who happens to look upon
&+mthem.

&+MAt the Great Stair of Mist~
  &+WThe Great stairway leads up into the guest quarters of the
&+Wcitidel.  The stair seems to be made of pure mist, shifting
&+Wconstantly even as it is stable and unyielding to the touch.
&+WThe stair winds around the inner side of the citidel and seems
&+Wto be supported only by the walls that it makes contact with.
&+WEven though disconcerting at first, Climbing the stairway is
&+Wquite an experience and is an impressive sight for any eye.

&+CA Majestic Hallway Inside the Citadel~
  &+WThe hallway here shows the majesty of Bahamut.  The flagstones
&+ware made of White Gypsum streaked with designs inscribed with
silver.  The walls seem to be made of marble but are covered in a
fine mist that shimmers and shifts in the light.  There are huge
chandaliers made of pewter hanging from the high ceilings supporting
torches that never seem to dim or fade.  Inset into the walls are
&+Wsmall arched niches that house small &+ystatues &+wand &+rartifacts.
&+wThe hallways are silent yet they seem to ring with a harmonious tone
that permeates the air all around.  There is a majesty here that cannot
&+Wbe found in any mortal realm.  It is hard to keep focused on any
&+wtask while in the presence of such grandeur.

  &+LThis is a vault that may have once been fair to look upon.
&+LNow however, the &+Revil &+Lthat lurks here has changed this place
&+Linto a stinking pit of malice and death.  The very air is filled
&+Lwith a loathing of all things living and dead.  This place is where
&+WBahamut &+Lkeeps those evil beings that he has caught and who he deems
&+Lto be a danger to all things &+Wgood and fair.  &+LTo call this
&+Lplace dangerous would be an understatement to say the least.

&+WThe Garden of Light~
  &+GThis is the majestic &+WGarden of Light.  &+GBahamut planted this
&+Ggarden when he first created this citidel for himself in ages past.
&+GIn this garden one may find all types of fair plant and tree.  It is
&+Gsaid that every type of plant known can be found somewhere in this

&+MThe Secret Study of Grimsoar~
  &+mThis is the secret study of &+yGrimsoar, the Aged.  &+mthe room
&+mis ancient, and there are tomes and scrolls laying on tables and
&+mfalling off shelves.  The room would be not be considered dirty,
&+mjust disorderly and cluttered.  The owner of the room is one of
&+mthe few permanent residents in this citidel.  This is Grimsoar's
&+mdomain as was given to him by Bahamut in years past uncountable.
&+mGrimsoar spends his time in study, researching vague, and bizarre
&+mtopics that would hold no interest to any but him.  He does however
&+mhave a knowledge of just about anything and everything one could
&+mpossibly want to know.  This makes him an invaluable source of
&+mknowledge for Bahamut and is thus considered one of his most
&+mvalued advisors.

&+yQuarters of &+YLareth, King of Justice~
  &+yThese are the quarters of the mighty King of Justice.
&+YLareth &+yis a Gold Great Wyrm of an ancient age, and an
&+yalmost infinite wisdom.  His power is akin to that of a god,
&+yand only one other dragon surpasses him.  However, even as
&+ypowerful as he is, his is but a small force compared to the
&+yMight of Bahamut.  The quarters of Lareth are of the kind
&+ythat one might expect to find when looking into the life
&+yof a being such as he.  There are many ancient artifacts
&+yprecisely arrayed on shelves sharing their space with tomes
&+yof ancient lore.  There are furnishings that are designed for
&+yhuman form, or so it seems to be at this moment.  Some wise
&+ytravellers say that the quarters of Lareth look never the same
&+yfor any two beings viewing it.

  &+yThese are the inner quarters of &+YLareth, King of Justice.
&+yThe furnishings are human-like in appearance but that may be
&+yonly because &+YLareth &+ywishes it to be so for the moment.
&+yThe Power of the great king of justice is apparent in the sheer
&+ymajesty of the surroundings.  There is only one being with more
&+ypower and greatness in this mighty citidel..one who is so high
&+yabove all, that Lareth is to he as a brook seems beside the
&+ygreat sea.

&+WThe Re&+wceiv&+Wing R&+woo&+Wm &+wof &+WBahamut, King of Dragons~
  &+WThis is the room where Bahamut receives his guests and those

&+Wmajestic, with pillars of purest white marble rising into nothing.
&+WIn the center of room against the back wall is the throne where
