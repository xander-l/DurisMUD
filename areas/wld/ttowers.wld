&+YThe Beautiful Entryway to the Northern Tower~
&+W  The courtyard to the south approaches up to a set of wooden doors,
&+Wthat open up into the northern tower of the Twin Towers. Written upon
&+Wthe doors is a series of small pixie writings, that appear to have
&+Wbeen written while the tower was being constructed. Walls made of
&+Wcarefully piled up stone stretch out to the east and west, forming
&+Wthe courtyard between the two towers and the temple.

&+YThe First Floor Entryway of a Cozy Tower~
&+W  The dust has settled on this cozy tower, and warm sunlight
&+Wpours in through the windows. A pair of wooden stairs lead up
&+Wto the higher levels of the tower.  Small torch holders are
&+Wplaced every so feet around the entryway to provide light
&+Wwhen darkness comes.  Flowers, collected from the garden,
&+Whave been placed in beautifully adorned vases, situated on
&+Wsome stools in the corners of the room.  A small rug, which
&+Wseems to be slightly askew, is laid upon the floor. A large
&+Wmirror is hung on the wall to the north.

&+La hide away place.  There is a wooden trapdoor that leads up. A

   This is the top floor of the northern tower, and seems to be the
best decorated of all the floors.  A red carpet runs from the stairs
to the south through the hallways to the east and west.  To the east,
the hallway is wooden and decorated with many potted plants and flower
pots, while to the west, the hallway is stone with many portraits and
tapestries.  This room seems to be a combination of both hallways,
and contains both potted plants and paintings.

   This hallway must obviously lead to the druid's main room, because
of all the plant life around this area, it is almost like walking
through a forest with all of the huge plants.  The only thing that
keeps it from looking entirely like a forest is the red carpet, and
the pots at the bottom of the plants.  The druid's main room is
to the north, where she can be seen most often.

&+MA Pale Magenta Room~
&+m  Once a great cheerful place, Mixt is now a very sad little man.
&+mHe once had a great lover named Lyena, who lived in the southern tower,
&+mand together they constructed the great forest for everyone to enjoy.
&+mOne day, a great tragedy fell upon Mixt as Lyena was killed by a
&+mgroup of drunken orcs who were in the forest.  Lyena's spirit was
&+mthen trapped in the tower, forever wondering along with ghosts of
&+mher friends and servants.  Mixt decided to close the tower up and
&+mkeep it locked as the ghosts aren't very friendly to outsiders.
&+mHe kept the outside appearence of the tower in relatively wonderful
&+mcondition, as to keep up the name "Twin Towers."

&+GA Lush Green Room~
&+g    The great druid Blaevyna, a grey elf from Sylvandawn, has taken this
&+groom upon herself as her study and bedroom. Blaevyna first moved to this
&+gtower from the great elven lands because of Lyena's untimely death, and
&+gto keep the forest nice and bright, she came her to work her druidic
&+gpowers.  She works very closely with the sprites of the forest, as they
&+gboth are lovers of the forest, however, from time to time, the naughty
&+gpixies are found in here having a great talk down by Blaevyna for
&+gterrorizing the people who visit the forest.  A small box of little
&+gwands lies in the corner of the room, undoubtedly collected from the
&+gnaughty pixies.  This entire room is filled with blooming plants and
&+glush bushes, planted in small pots.

&+Lbetween the inside of the Souther Tower and the Northern Tower,
&+Lbut since the death of Lyena, Mixt has kept this tower in
&+Lseclusion and all locked up.  Spider webs fill this room, and
&+Levery room of the tower.  A foul smell of rotted corpses fills
&+Lthe stagnant air of the tower. All light and places to get
&+Lenter the tower from, such as windows, have been boarded up
&+Lby Mixt.  This tower is a tower of darkness. A huge pile of
&+Lrubble seems to be blocking the stairs to the south. A small
&+Ltorn rug seems to conceal something on the floor.

&+Land is showing the effects of time very well.  A thick layer
&+Lof dust covers everything, although it is hard to tell the difference
&+Lof where the dust stops and the spider webs start.  Old pictures of
&+Lthe servants are hung on the wall, and their corpses not far behind.
&+LThis particular set of bunks seem to be for some of the elven
&+Lservants.  There are paintings of the great elven city, Sylvandawn,
&+Lat the head of the beds here.

&+L  This dark passage seems to be the remains of the servants' quarters
&+Lof Lyena.  Cobwebs fill this room. This area is now rubble filled,
&+Land is showing the effects of time very well.  A thick layer
&+Lof dust covers everything, although it is hard to tell the difference
&+Lof where the dust stops and the spider webs start.  Old pictures of
&+Lthe servants are hung on the wall, and their corpses not far behind.
&+LThese quarters were probably the homes of a pair of Tharnadian
&+Lservants, with pictorials of Tharnadia by the bed.

&+Lstairs probably used to look identical, but with the aging of time,

&+Lpossible to see the entryway of the first floor beneath here.
&+LThe spiral stairs of the Southern Tower lie to the south, while
&+Lthe pantries and storage facilities, in whatever condition they
&+Lmight be, lie to the east and west of this section of the tower.
&+LThis place doesn't seem like it was very heavily decorated by
&+LLyena, however it is difficult to tell with all the rotting
&+Land bug infestation that has occured. An very potent smell
&+Lseems to be coming from the pantry to the west, while
&+Lthe door to the huge storage closet has been rusted open.
&+LIt seems there used to be torch holders throughout this
&+Lfoyer, but all of the torches crumble at the slightest
&+Lvibration, rendering them useless.

&+L  This circular pantry seems to encompass half the space of the
&+Lsecond floor.  Time has rotted all of the fruits and vegetables
&+Lthat were stored here, and now a pugnent odor fills this entire
&+Larea.  Shelves of all sorts of different foods from all of
&+LDuris must have been brought here, as there are elven pastries,
&+Ldwarven rum, berries from Woodseer, buffalo steaks from Ugta,
&+Land even some rare foods from the Underdark like fried
&+Lcalamari and lizard eggs.  Lyena must have been some kind
&+Lof great food collector of the world, as this place was
&+Lstacked to the rim.  Unforunately, Everything is long
&+Lrotted and perished now, except for a few bottles of ale.
&+LThe pantry contines to the south here, and the rotted
&+Lfoyer of the second floor is to the east. In this part of
&+Lthe pantry, large kegs of ale are stacked on old shelves,
&+Llooking like they will give way and come crashing down
&+Lany moment.  Small insects and vermin feast on the rotted
&+Lfood that time has left to sit here.

&+LPiles and piles of bags, filled with grains, have been
&+Lstacked up here, which were probably taken to the bakery
&+Lon the next floor for producing the fine breads that Lyena
&+Lenjoyed.  Most of the bags have been torn open and have
&+Lserved as the primary source of food for many small
&+Lanimals that now inhabit this tower.  There seems to be
&+La small button, that is slightly hidden, on the northern
&+Lwall.  It appears to be partialy covered by rags.

&+LA Hidden Room~
&+L  When Mixt and Lyena built these towers, they seem to have included
&+La few safe rooms where they could retreat to if they were ever attacked.
&+LThis appears to be one of those rooms.  This room is right by the grand
&+Lfoyer of the second floor, and there are two small peep holes to look
&+Lout into the foyer.  A small lever opens the secret entrance to the
&+Lpantry.  The walls here are reinforced with extra thick steel and
&+Lrock, making it very thick, while there are also air vents that
&+Lbring in fresh air from the stairway.  If someone were to escape
&+Lthe horrors that befell the Southern Tower, this is probably one
&+Lof the places they would have ran off to.  A small bed and a small
&+Lstorage locker sit in one corner of the room, while there is a deep
&+Lhole that acts like a latrine in the event that a person is trapped
&+Lin this secret room for a very long time.

&+L  This huge storage closet seems to have been the location
&+Lwhere the servants of the Southern Tower kept their gardening
&+Ltools, building tools, and just about anything they couldn't
&+Lfit in their cubby holes in their quarters.  Various things,
&+Lfrom hoes to furniture, are cluttered about this area. Most of
&+Lthis stuff has rotted with time and is in poor condition
&+Lto say the least. There are even a few weapons from
&+LTharnadia and Sylvandawn lying in racks, however, they
&+Lappear to be mostly rusted from the long time they were
&+Lsitting here. The foyer of the second floor lies to the
&+Least here, while this huge closet continues to the south.
&+LIn this particular area of the storage closet, there are
&+Lmostly gardening tools, uniforms, and extra supplies.
&+LThere is also a small chest sitting under a crumpled
&+Lup gardening uniform.  The chest appears to be rather
&+Lsmall, with some strange writing written upon it.

&+LIt appears there was a small scuffel to get to these weapons
&+Lbecause many of the weapons are missing from their rack, and
&+Lothers lies on the floor.

   This was the main room of the entire Southern Tower.  This room
spans the entire length and width of the fourth floor of the tower.
This room is Lyena's personal bedroom, office, and whatever she
desired.  Once upon a time, long ago, Lyena would host parties
for all of the people from her tower, Mixt's tower and the temple.
However now, this place is dismall, holding much sorrow.  The
entire area has been routed through, and things lie in heaps
all about the room. A huge orcish hunter now presides in this
area, feasting on the provisions of the tower, quite content
in his work.  A small pillow near Lyena's old bed seems to
cover some kind of a button.

alive and well, resting in this room. Long ago, when one might
have gazed upon Lyena, they would have seen a beautiful half-elven
woman, with golden hair, large breasts, and a cute smile.
Everything has changed now however, Lyena sits in this large
stone room wearing nothing but black, with black hair, and
black colored lips.  Whatever possesed her to become like
this is far beyond anything Mixt could have ever dreamed.

as much as Mixt and Lyena of the Twin Towers do.  Most of the
flowers found in the gardens around the courtyard can be found
here in this small garden that encricles the temple.  Every now
and then, small pixie can be seen walking about this area,
picking flowers and taking it to another pixie.

&+WThe Foyer of the Temple~
    The foyer of the temple is simple, as these monks and priests pray
to a simple God.  The foyer has plain white marble walls leading up
to a marble altar to the north.  Small potted trees line the walls,
and potted flowers on the window ledges.  There is a burlap carpet
that runs the length of the temple. The courtyard lies to the east.

&+WThe Altar of the Temple~
    This temple is rather small, only encompassing the main church
area here, and the foyer to the east.  The monks and priests seem
to have bunks lining the walls of the temple, and there are usually
a few sleeping during any hour of the day since they have services
every hour of every day. A humble looking priest stands at the
altar, blessing some water in preparation for the services. There
appears to be some sort of opening just under the altar.

&+yA Musty Wooden Tunnel~
&+y   This tunnel appears to have been dug out at first, and then later, by
&+ysome magical force, reinforced with wood that has grown into the earthen
&+ylayer, as to prevent a cave in.  There is a small trapdoor and a few
&+ystepping stones leading up to the temple of light, while the tunnel winds
&+yaround to the south.  This area seems rather peaceful, yet well traveled.

&+Lup into the southern tower, and the tunnel continues
&+Lto the north, into the darkness.

&+mA Huge Pool of Slime&n~
    This area appears to be the home of the legendary
roper creature.  This pool is filled with slime and small
organisms, many of which the roper has fed on in the past.
Additionally lies the corpse of several duergar miners who
failed to sneak past the roper while it was in its slumber.

&+LThe Back of The Cellar~
   The back of the cellar has been cleared away to be used, by the
halfling warriors, as an interrogation facility.  It appears that
the duergar miner they found has gotten mixt worried that such
a vile creature could violate his sacred tower.  He is very fearful
of the things around him.  At this very moment, an almost dead
duergar miner is chained to the wall, as a halfling councilor
questions him.

    This dark cave is where the mining team had tunneled
to get to this deep shaft under the towers.  However, a cave
in has caused a cave in here, preventing re-entry into the
underdark.  The area is littered with the tracks of a large
roper, its home appearing to be the slime pool to the east.
