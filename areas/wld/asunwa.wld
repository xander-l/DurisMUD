&nOn a &+yMountainous &nPlateu Before a &+LDark Cave&n~
&nThe &+ymountains &ncome to a plateau here, then continue back upwards after about
a mile. Off to the side of this flat area is a shadowed area in the rocks, and
upon closer inspection it appears to be a &+Ldark cave&n. There are vines and other
fauna creeping out of the mouth of the cave, curling around the feet of the
twin &+LJ&+Ga&+Lgu&+Ga&+Lr &+wstatues&n that stand on guard.&n

&nThe &+LJ&+Ga&+Lgu&+Ga&+Lr &+wstatues &nare in the sitting position. They have been created by
someone with an amazing skill; the cats look like they could get up and
wander away at any second. Their bodies have been made out of the same &+Lblack
stone &nthat surrounds the area, but their eyes are of a &+Gforest green emerald&n.

&nA &+LCavern &nCrawling With &+GVines&n~
&nThis cavern has slick &+Lblack &nrock walls, but somehow the &+Gvines &nhave managed
to dig into it and survive. It has a rounded, almost man-made appearance, and
there are the faint outlines of what might have been carvings in the &+wstone.
&nThe air here is humid and smells faintly of earth and other living things.&n

&nA Downward Sloping &+LCavern&n~
&nThe &+Lcavern &nbegins a downward descent here, and the walls seem to be getting
farther apart. They also no longer seem to have been created by man, and the
floor has become uneven, giving unsteady footing and lots of things to trip
over. A rumbling sound can be heard from below and to the south, but it is
not distiguishable as anything.&n

&nThe &+Lcave &nhas expanded into a gigantic cavern. There is a ledge running around
the edge of it and you are on the northern rim of it. Below this point, another
&+Ltunnel &nempties the river that rushes through it out into space. The &+Bwater
&ncascades downwards, out of sight to the south. The noise is positively
deafening. This room is lighter than the last two, it seems to be coming from

&nThis room is lit by something, though it is hard to tell what. The light
seems to diffuse from this one room, and gives you the best view you've had
so far of the surging &+Bwaterfall &nbelow. With the apparently magical lighting
in here, it is possible to see the water crashing on to the rocks underneath,
bouncing and churning and then flowing on to the south. There is an eerie
glow from the bottom of the falls, but it seems to be natural light reflected
off of the water.

&nUpon closer examination one can tell that the &+Lhole &nat the bottom of the wall

but it appears to be the outline of a cat of some sort, about the length of

of the room, creating an aisle that leads straight to the carved &+Lslabs&n. There
