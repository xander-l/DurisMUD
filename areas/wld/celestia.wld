&+chavoc upon their &+Wsouls&+c.  The storm itself is spiritual in nature,
&+cand due to the damage it can cause on both the &+Can&+Wgel&+ckin and &+rdevil-

&+crelief spot for the tired and weary mortal adventurers battling in

&+LA Vortex of Dark Matter&n~
&+w    As the eternal war of &+WCel&+Ces&+ctia&+w continues to rage on across the
&+Lheavens here a brief and uncanny section of seclusion appears amongst
&+wthe chaos.  At first glance it appears to be a welcome distraction,
&+Lyet it is obvious that even soldiers of the gods are frightened of
&+wthis spot, where a massive, throbbing pocket of dark matter creates
&+La vaccuum of time and space.  The pocket looks like a whirlpool of
&+wa &+Ldarkness&+w so &+Lblack&+w, that is actually swallows &+Wlight&+w.&n

&+cof the &+WCel&+Ces&+ctia &+cPlane.   Though the eternal battle continues to rage
&+bon, something here, at this &+Wmisty &+bblue rift, seems to put things into
&+wa strange perspective, to almost slow things down.   The rift, swirling
&+cin and out of existence like a phantasm is quite large and by glancing
&+btowards its sealed entrance one can feel whatever is inside pulling
