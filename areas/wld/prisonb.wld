&+LBefore a Large Black Gate&N~
   A large set of black marble gates have been erected around
the passage to the north.  Around the frame of the gates, there
is something inscribed.  Upon closer examination, one notices
that there is something devious about some of the figurines
inscribed on a few of the frames.  Just beyond this gate, a
church can be seen.  The forest lies just to the west.
