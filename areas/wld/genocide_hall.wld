trophies~
&+L   Several &+wtrophies &+Ladorn various places within this diabolical chamber of dead&N
&+Ldespair.  They consist of an orc, &+rduergar&+L, and what appears to be the head of a&N

duergar~
&+L   This ugly head has been shrunken to a rather minute size.  The eyes of this&N
&+Lbeast still flow with unbound &+Rhat&+rr&+Re&+rd&+L.  At one time this creature was a bringer&N
&+Lof death and dismay.  Now he is simply another trophy for the diabolical head&N
&+Lhunter.  Nocturnal name '&+wFrenbar&+L' etched into a tarnished demon spawned vile&N

&+L   This &+Chuman &+Lhead has been shrunken to a very small size.  The eyes still gaze&N
&+Lwith a cold despair filled hatred.  Images of past victims flicker within your&N

&+Ldelight, laughing as he deals out fright.  One who is of the &+wunlight&+L, stalker&N
&+Lin the nocturnal night.  Hunter of those who are weak enough to pray.  Master&N
&+Lof lost &+Cs&+co&+Cu&+cl&+Cs&+L, only death is real.  Wicked word '&+WT&+we&+Wz&+wc&+Wa&+wt&+Wl&+wi&+Wp&+wo&+Wc&+wa&+L' etched into the&N

&+L   This orc head has been shrunken to a rather small size.  The plaque at the&N

&+Lthe feeble light.  Da&+ro&+Ll&+ro&+Lth of darkness who rides the planes of nightmares, a&N

blood baphomet~
&+L   The symbol of &+RBaphomet &+Lwas used by the Knights &+wTemplar &+Lto represent Satan.&N
&+LThrough the ages this symbol has been called by many different names.  Among&N
&+Lthese are:  The Goat of Mendes, The Goat of a Thousand Young, The Black Goat,&N
&+LThe Judas Goat, and perhaps most appropriately, The Scapegoat.  &+RBaphomet&N
&+Lrepresents the Powers of Darkness combined with the generative fertility of the&N
&+Lgoat.  In its "pure" form the pentagram is shown encompassing the figure of man&N
&+Lin the five points of the star--three points up, two pointing down--symbolizing&N
&+Lman's spiritual nature.  In Satanism the pentagram is also used, but since&N
&+LSatanism represents the carnal instincts of man, or the opposite of the&N
&+Lspiritual nature, the pentagram is inverted to perfectly accommodate the head&N
&+Lof the goat--its horns, representing duality, thrust upwards in defiance; the&N
&+Lother three points inverted, or the trinity denied.  The Hebraic figures around&N
&+Lthe outer circle of the symbol which stem from the magical teachings of the&N
&+LKabala, spell out "L&+be&+Lv&+bia&+Lth&+ba&+Ln," the serpent of the watery abyss, and identified&N
&+Lwith Satan.  These figures correspond to the five points of the inverted star.&N

picture painting diabolical infinity~
&+Linto the infinity of thoughts&N
&+wAs the Darkness creeps over the Northern mountains of Norway and the silence&N
&+wreach the woods, I awake and rise...  Into the night I wander, like many nights&N
&+wbefore, and like in my dreams, but centuries ago.  Under the moon, under the&N
&+wtrees.  Into the Infinity of Darkness, beyond the light of a new day, into the&N
&+wfrozen nature chilly, beyond the warmth of the dying sun.  Hear the whispering&N
&+wof the wind, the Shadows calling...I gaze into the moon which grants me visions&N
&+wthese twelve full moon nights of the year, and for each night the light of the&N
&+wholy disciples fade away.  Weaker and weaker, one by one.  I gaze into the moon&N
&+wwhich makes my mind pure as crystal lakes, my eyes cold as the darkest winter&N
&+wnights, by yet there is a flame inside.  It guides me into the dark shadows&N
&+wbeyond this world, into the infinity of thoughts..thoughts of upcoming reality.&N
&+wIn the name of the almighty Emperor I will ride the Lands in pride, carrying&N
&+wthe Blacksword at hand, in warfare. I will grind my hatred upon the loved ones.&N
&+wDespair will be brought upon the hoping childs of happiness.  Wherever there is&N
&+wjoy the hordes of the eclipse will pollute sadness and hate under the reign of&N
&+wfear.  The lands will grow black.  There is no sunrise yet to come into the&N
&+wwastelands of phantoms lost.  May these moments under the moon be eternal.  May&N
&+wthe infinity haunt me...  In Darkness.&N

goat~
&+r   This is a &+Lsymbol&+r that has been soaked in &+Rblood&+r.  The image consists of a&N
&+rcircle that has an inverted pentagram drawn within it.  A &+Lgoat &+rhas also been&N
&+rincluded inside the pentagram itself.  The &+Whorns &+rof the &+Lgoat &+rare thrust upward&N
&+rin denial of the &+Rtr&+ri&+Rn&+ri&+Rty&+r.  The mouth downward and the ears occupy the east and&N
&+rwest points.  The eyes of this creature seem to glare with an unholy sort of&N
&+raware.  You feel a shiver run down along your &+Wspine&+r, meanwhile your feeble mind&N
&+ris telling you that everything is just fine.  Thoughts of the past start to&N
&+Linvade &+rthe present, causing resent to resurface and regret to run rampant.&N

&+Ldemonical creature, and a shadow scaled black dragon are etched in the ceiling.&N
&+LMost likely these mystical drawings have been drawn by those who are not of the&N
&+Llight.  Shadows that stalk the nocturnal noctambulant night.  Bringers of hell&N
&+Lspun fright, rulers of &+Ct&+cw&+Ci&+cl&+Ci&+cg&+Ch&+ct&+L.  Dead minions from long since past, immortal&N
&+Lever lasting pain.  Memories drove them far from sane, nordic hordes came.  A&N

dragon scaled~
&+L   Scales of darkness upon a beast of dismal despair.  The eyes of fire burn in&N
&+Lsockets of &+rp&+Ra&+rg&+Ra&+rn &+Rf&+ri&+Rr&+re&+L.  Beastial images of death fade into your mind and shiver&N
&+Ldown along your spine.  Nothing no longer seems to be even close to fine.  A&N
&+Lsign is sort in the sky of the realms of the dark one.  Monsters morph into&N
&+Lyour brain from the nine hells of the infernal plane.  Dreams of the lost are&N
&+Lforever to be no longer.  Screams of torment ring out within your head, yes&N
&+Lfilling you with dread.  The wings of this beast span at least eighteen feet&N
&+Lacross and have stains of dried crimson on them.  The claws of terror also have&N
&+Ltasted the blood of the eager to die meager.  This symbol has been drawn by&N
&+wThose of The Unlight&+L.&N

azure odd~
&+L   This symbol seems to depict the &+Wnorthern &+Lhordes destroying the feeble weak.&N
&+LThey seem to be &+bberserkers &+Land they are immune to almost anything they rush at&N
&+Lthe meek and they smash and destroy.  Thine eyes dilated into a mystic image of&N
&+Luntold deathless fear.  Perhaps they are on mushrooms or maybe they are just&N
&+Lthe true warriors of this realm and any other.  The battle comes to life you&N
&+Lsee the vyking horde destroying legions of lesser warriors with greater armies.&N
&+LYet they are not even a match for the true hordes of the berserker masters, not&N
&+Lthe would be zerkers that have been unleashed in many places.  These are the&N
&+Lreal deal that are the facts and not the balanced weaklings that many wish to&N
&+Lbe truth.  They slash and cut their way threw their out classed enemies, they&N
&+Lalmost seem to be having fun.  The &+Wnordic &+Bthunder &+Ldestroys all that dare to&N
&+Lstand in the path of &+rKvasir &+Land his &+rbl&+Ro&+ro&+Rd &+Lborn troops.  The mighty one can be&N
&+Lseen holding his large hammer and smashing the &+Wskulls &+Lof all those that still&N

&+Lyou realize you can never be a true berserker for you lack the &+Rbloodlust&+L.&N

baphomet~
&+L   This symbol has been drawn here by one of those who is of the &+wunlight&+L.  It&N
&+Ldepicts a goat within an inverted pentagram that is enclosed by a circle.  The&N
&+Whorns&+L of the beast are thrust upward in denial of the &+rtr&+Ri&+rn&+Ri&+rty&+L and the mouth is&N
&+Lpointed downward.  The ears of this being flow to the east and to the west and&N
&+Lare within the points of the pentagram.  The eyes of this black goat seem to&N
&+Lpenetrate the soul and sends an eerie &+Bchill&+L within the body.  Fears long since&N
&+Lthought dead invade the mind and become the present.  The regrets of your life&N
&+Lbecomes all that you can think of.  You wonder how you could of been so wrong&N
&+Lin following the light.  D&+barkne&+Lss is the true power and to deny that is to&N
&+Lremain feeble.  The visions blur and twist into an odd array of nothingness.&N

&+LThe cries of the lost fill your mortal mind as you gaze at this symbol of the&N

&+Ldefy the d&+barkne&+Lss burn in the &+Ct&+cw&+Ci&+cl&+Ci&+cg&+Ch&+ct &+Lof &+wunlight&+L.  Suffering of the fallen&N
&+Lfools who thought they could survive the fires of the black abyss.  Screams of&N
&+Ltorment, torture of the meek, death to any who seek.  Focus wishes it was no&N
&+Llonger as reality fades into a &+bnight&+Lmare.  Heads upon stakes, &+Rbl&+ro&+Ro&+rd &+Lapon thine&N
&+Lground, eyes rolled by fatal fate.  Hate of the light, &+Bthunder &+Lcrackles within&N
&+Lthe demonic air.  &+CSh&+Wi&+Cv&+We&+Crs &+Lslowly stream down your &+Wspine&+L, nothing at all seems&N
&+Lto be even near fine.  Time drifts into limbo, what is real no longer can be&N

insignia darkuul~
&+L   This dark magenta colored &+minsignia &+Ldoes not seem to be one that is of the&N

&+Lthe true might.  Only those with the sight can ever see, never to be right,&N
&+Lliving just to fight.  Serve the &+revil &+Ltill the day of no longer, worship the&N
&+Lmaster or die.  &+mDarkuul &+Lis the dark lord who shall deliver us from the hordes&N
&+Lof &+Chumans&+L.  The &+Ydwarves &+Lshall be tossed as they always have been, as in the now&N
&+Land what becomes the past.  Words of wisdom no longer hold meaning in the realm&N
&+Lof mortals.  Those that seem to be &+WImmortal &+Lmust kill all who dare to stand in&N
&+Ltheir way.  Mercy is for the meek who shall be given nothing and all shall be&N
&+Ltaken from them.  Power creates the rules, hiding in the shadows the goodies&N
&+Llurk in their pathetic groups.  Men of twenty yet not even to have one, all for&N
&+Lthemselves and nothing for the all.  Reality starts to fade into your eyes and&N

demonical creature~
&+L   Eyes that have gazed upon the nine hells, wings that have glided upon the&N

&+Ldespair.  Horns that are thrust upward in denial of the feeble trinity.  A&N
&+LKris style pitchfolk with waves of hatred burned into it.  This creature seems&N
&+Lto be almost alive.  A cold &+Bchill &+Lfrom beyond shivers down your mortal &+Wspine&+L.&N
&+LYour eyes start to burn with sorrow of those who have wronged you in your past.&N
&+LHatred overcomes you as you decide it is time to strike down your enemies once&N
