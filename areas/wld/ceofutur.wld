&+LA&n &+GGrassy Area&n &+LCovered in&n &+wSmoke&n~
   This area is covered in grass, though at the extremes
the burning and decimation barely stopped.  Thick smoke
is heavy in the air, obscuring vision, yet a sense of
peace is evident.  The grass shows signs of being trampled,
but already is recovering.

   A small camp fire burns on this scorched patch of
earth.  A cook pot has been errected over the fire,
some sort of stew boiling away.  The ground has been
burned so fiercly that it breaks away in thin slabs
of hard packed earth.  In places the charcole colored
earth, has been trampled into a fine dust, which
takes to the air at the slightest breeze.

   Not much remains of this piece of land, small traces
of what was once a road can be seen under the destruction.
The land has been scoured of of its sruface, so deeply
that little will replace it for many years to come.  The
topsoil, little more than ash, blows slowly about into the
smoke filled air, further removing that which once was.

&+LA Barren and Scarred Piece of Earth&n~
   Not much remains of this piece of land, small traces
of what was once a road can be seen under the destruction.
The land has been scoured of of its sruface, so deeply
that little will replace it for many years to come.  The
topsoil, little more than ash, blows slowly about into the
smoke filled air, further removing that which once was.

   A small camp fire burns on this scorched patch of
earth.  A cook pot has been errected over the fire,
some sort of stew boiling away.  The ground has been
burned so fiercly that it breaks away in thin slabs
of hard packed earth.  In places the charcole colored
earth, has been trampled into a fine dust, which
takes to the air at the slightest breeze.

&+LA Barren and Scarred Piece of Earth&n~
   Not much remains of this piece of land, small traces
of what was once a road can be seen under the destruction.
The land has been scoured of of its sruface, so deeply
that little will replace it for many years to come.  The
topsoil, little more than ash, blows slowly about into the
smoke filled air, further removing that which once was.

   A small camp fire burns on this scorched patch of
earth.  A cook pot has been errected over the fire,
some sort of stew boiling away.  The ground has been
burned so fiercly that it breaks away in thin slabs
of hard packed earth.  In places the charcole colored
earth, has been trampled into a fine dust, which
takes to the air at the slightest breeze.

   A small camp fire burns on this scorched patch of
earth.  A cook pot has been errected over the fire,
some sort of stew boiling away.  The ground has been
burned so fiercly that it breaks away in thin slabs
of hard packed earth.  In places the charcole colored
earth, has been trampled into a fine dust, which
takes to the air at the slightest breeze.

&+LThe Blackened Remains of a&n &+bBlu&+Besto&+bne&n &+LStreet&n~
   Once a well used street in the town, this solid
bluestone street is burned and scarred.  The once
lustrous colors of the stone have been blackened over
by the magic and fires of the evil horde that burned
the town to the ground.  In places rends in the stone
can be seen, their deep fissures torn from the stone
itself.

   A victim of the evil horde that over ran the town,
this single story wooden structure stood little chance

   Not much remains of this piece of land, small traces
of what was once a road can be seen under the destruction.
The land has been scoured of of its sruface, so deeply
that little will replace it for many years to come.  The

&+LA Barren and Scarred Piece of Earth&n~
   Not much remains of this piece of land, small traces
of what was once a road can be seen under the destruction.
The land has been scoured of of its sruface, so deeply
that little will replace it for many years to come.  The
topsoil, little more than ash, blows slowly about into the
smoke filled air, further removing that which once was.

   A small camp fire burns on this scorched patch of
earth.  A cook pot has been errected over the fire,
some sort of stew boiling away.  The ground has been
burned so fiercly that it breaks away in thin slabs
of hard packed earth.  In places the charcole colored
earth, has been trampled into a fine dust, which
takes to the air at the slightest breeze.

&+LA Barren and Scarred Piece of Earth&n~
   Not much remains of this piece of land, small traces
of what was once a road can be seen under the destruction.
The land has been scoured of of its sruface, so deeply
that little will replace it for many years to come.  The
topsoil, little more than ash, blows slowly about into the
smoke filled air, further removing that which once was.

&+LA&n &+rCam&+Rp Fi&+rre&n &+Lon Scorched Earth&n~
   A small camp fire burns on this scorched patch of
earth.  A cook pot has been errected over the fire,
some sort of stew boiling away.  The ground has been
burned so fiercly that it breaks away in thin slabs
of hard packed earth.  In places the charcole colored
earth, has been trampled into a fine dust, which
takes to the air at the slightest breeze.

&+LA Dark Cavernous Tunnel&n~
   This large cavern appears to have been burned out of
the solid rock.  All the surfaces have a smooth glossy
look to them, giving it an almost polished look.  The
smell of death is strong here, with no fresh air
permeating the depths.  The cavern ceiling rises fourty
feet, with miniature spikes dripping down from the roof.

&+Lto be safe from the ravaging power of the
&+LChronomancer, who resides in the vortex to the south.
