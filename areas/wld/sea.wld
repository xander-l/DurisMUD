A &+GSeaweed Covered &+LGrate&N~
     A small cave seems to have formed in the coral here. The bright red
substance occurs everywhere but down, where a seaweed covered grate lays,
apparently forgotten. Perhaps the coral has grown over whatever may have
once laid here. A long-sunken ship perhaps? The only obvious exit is down.

A Tunnel Through Some &+RCoral&N~
     Though constantly used, this tunnel still has a few snags along its
walls, as though the mysterious creatures that create this protective
sheath where somehow trying to repair the flaw in their masterpiece. An
intricately worked iron grate lies above, apparently taken from a ship
that sank in these waters long ago. The tunnel leads down.

     A slight movement of water courses through the latticework of coral
that encompasses all directions but up and down. The once-smooth walls

close in the gap that now exists.

A &+WSilver-Worked&N &+LGrate&N~
     Made of a lusterous material that seems never to tarnish, this silver-
worked grate bridges the gap between the coral walls, as though it alone can
manage to keep the passage open. About three inches thick, the wrought metal
can keep all but the smallest creatures from entering what may lie underneath
it. The tunnrl leads up.

Central Square of &+BG&+Cra&+Ben&+Cdi&+Bae&N~
     A cavern deep in the heart of the coral reef, this is the meeting spot
that the learned men come to to contemplate and philisophilize on matters
of little or no importance. It is also one of the major intersections on
The Crescent Current, Graendiae's main north-south waterway. To the east and
west lies the Path of Friendship. Swimming down leads to the Waterways and
its various shops.

that are an intergral part of the structure. It is obvious that the aquatics
take care not to harm their fragile coral home unless the creatures that
create the red material encrouch too much on the aquatics space. That may be
just the case here in a few dozen decades. To the south lies the Crescent

&+wFlow of Friendship~
     A gentle curve in the path helps funnel the barely evident current so
that the waste that is produced by the azure algae aids in stunting the
growth of the umbre coral. Though effetive, this technique is not rountinely
used, if only for aesthetic reasons. In this rarely used area, however, the
benefits outway the downside. The path leads south and east.

     To the west lies the end of the Flow of Friendship, as it intersects
with the Path of Redemption. To the north the Flow of Friendship leads back
to the center of Graendiae. A small deserted apartment lies to the south.

&+wFriendship &+gand &+mRedemption &+gIntersection~
     The Flow of Friendship ends here in a t-intersection with the Path of
Redemption. A gentle current wafts through the thick coral to the west, while
the wall of the south seems unusually cracked, propbably because of how old
this sector is. The Flow of Friendship leads back to the east.

Path of &+GGrasses&N~
     A thin covering of grass grow along the floor and walls of the coral
tunnel here, thus giving it its name. To the north lies the main north-south
waterway of Graendiae, the Crescent Current, while this path slopes downward
at a forty-five degree angle.

Path of &+GGrasses&N~
     A thin layering of grass covers this small path that leads to the Pjworn
Fields, where Graendiea's finest are bred and fed before becoming chowder.
To the south lies one of the entrances to the Waterways, the lower level
of connecting tunnels. A ways to the north can be found the luxurious Inn of
the Flowering Anenome.

Path of &+GGrasses&N~
     The grasses sway in the gentle current that moves almost imperceptably
along the path as it slopes downward towards the Pjworn Fields. The coral
walls begin to give way to greyish rock that is sleek and smooth. The path
leads up and down.

Path of &+GGrasses~
     Sleek grey rock creates the walls here, a stark contrast to the coral
found throughout the rest of the city. To the east opens up a large cavern
where the pjworns are bred and harvested. Upwards lies the Path of Grass,
which eventually leads to the Waterways, Crescent Current, and Inn of the
Flowering Anenome.

     The smell of cooking chowder can cause even the most full stomach to
growl in hunger. The walls are smooth, only occasionally covered by a family
portait. The one on the far wall shows a young aquatic, newly married, with
his bride. The Flow of Friendship lies to the south.

     The sand from the bottom of the cave is constantly attempting to
infiltrate every nook and cranny in the area, be it walls, eyes, or bodily
openings. The rich brown and tan color was designed so as to give the pjworns
a sense of being free, as opposed to the pasture that it truly is. It is here
that the pjworns are bred and raised before becoming chowder for people the
world over. In fact, pjworn chowder is one of Graendiae's most luctrative
exports. The caverns continue to the north, south, east and west.

Pjworn Fields~
     Grey walls create the parameter of the Pjworn Fields. Small sea anenomes
grown in the small pockets along its surface, as well as a luminescent
algae that gives the caverns a strange reddish-green glow. The sandy bottom
is stirred up occationally as a pjworn gets its exercise.

Pjworn Fields~
     The sandy bottom of this large cavern creates the home for the pjworn.
The slippery grey walls of the rock walls create a rounded corner here,
to aid in the prevention of injury to these creatures as they are bred for
Graendiae's famous Pjworn Chowder, known throughout the realms as the finest
seafood delicacy available.

Once the proud workforce of the Shipwreck and Dive Recycling Center dwelled
here, the richest aquatics in the entire now. Now their company has gone
out of business, and with it, the prosperity that was once enjoyed here.
People have been forced simply by lack of income, to allow their homes to
become smaller and smaller as the  coral reclaims lost space. Formerly
lucrative homes are now no bigger than pockets of closets. The path goes on
to the east and up, while one of these small pockets is to the south.

     Upon the oval table in the center of the room lay numerous pestles and
mortars of various shapes and sizes. Brightly colored herbs grow within the
alabaster walls, protected by the small pockets the reside in. Empty bottles
float in the small room, posing no threat. The only exit is to the east.

     The sound of crickets chirping and wind rustling through trees fills
the room. So hypnotic is the sound that it allows the mind to rest, and with
it, the body to allow for mending. Only sound fills the room and nothing
more. The doorway leads to the west.

     It is common knowledge that the boy who is a shopkeeper here is an
orphan. It is also common knowledge that he doesn't like fighting. Probably
why he took of the family trade of selling magical goods. The business was
left to him by his father, who died in a magician's duel. Needless to say,
the boy has a bit of a temper. A doorway to the east leads back to the halls

Janinae gave the aquatics the power to harvest this great force. Others
believe it was a gnome scientist's bargain for his life. Of course, those
individuals are sought after as heretics. Needless to say, they speak their
opinion very loudly. The ceiling peaks here in a cathedral-like point.

&+MMmernlan Current~
     A bend in the Mmernlan Current has caused the southwestern corner of the
scarlet walls to be rubbed down and smooth, while the opposite side has
become overgrown, making the curve that much more pronounced. The path leads
from north to east.

&+MMmernlan Current~
     Mmernlan Current adjoins a connecting tunnel which leads to the Flow
of Friendship just to the north. To the west continues the lazy current as
it slowly flows into the Crescent Current. Just above is a small dwelling.

A Common Abode~
     A few bits of violet algae grown upon the walls, carefully cultivated
to produce a pleasing asthetic ambiance in the peaceful, circular room. Thin,
golden wire was been twisted intricately to form the container for a
sapphire-colored plant that hangs from the ceiling. A hole in the floor leads
back to Mmernlan Current.

&+YA Rectangular Home~
     An unusual rectangular shape, the resident obviously goes to great pains
to keep it so. The corners are crisp and the walls seem to have been measured
thoroughly. Even the few pieces of furniture conform to the same shape. The

Those not heavy enough float half-heartedly, as though not wanting to make
the effort to escape. A colorful fish has been caught within a helm of some
sort. Its rainbow hued snout pokes through the slits in the face plate.
Mmernlan Current lies to the south.

allow for food to be set on the table without floating away. Four swings hang
down, allowing individuals to anchor themselves down for meals. The floor
has been neatly swept and the coral walls scrubbed clean. The only exits
from the room and east and down.

aspiring artist. Though not very clean, it shows promising talent with its
variance of color and surface textures. A bed of some kind hangs from the
ceiling, allowing the artist to anchor themself and not float into walls
or other such things while slumbering or engaging in other extracurricular
activities. The only exit is to the west.

Center of &+GMarket Square~
     This is the common courtyard of several shops that line the area. It is
here that most of Graendiae's wheeling and dealing goes on. The sound of
bartering can be felt in the waves of the water, going deep to resonate
loudly in bone. And yet, there is a certain known peacefulness as well. The
only exit that does not lead to a shop is down into the Waterways.

the proprietor does not concern herself with seasonal styles. A few nitches
have been carved in the amnethyst-colored walls, and curtains hang over the
openings. A sign above them reads 'Fitting Rooms'. The doorway to the west

     The Tavern of the Broken Promise rarely seems to find customers. Whether
it be from the fact that tight-fisted merchants are difficult to pry a copper
from or whether the name has some connection has been a conversation topic
in Graendiae for quite some time. In any case, the matter has yet to be
resolved, in either direction. The inn lies to the east, while Market Square
is just to the west.

Current as it moves swiftly through the city of Graendiae. To the west lies
the main inn of the town.

delicate statuette here in honor of their goddess, whom they feel has blessed
this enclosed area.

The &+CCrescent Current&N~
     The pathway leads from east to west here, sepearting itself somewhat
from the direction below. The north is blocked by the usual coral walls, but
this one is a bit different in its texture. The elves here believe that
because of this, the room beyond it is sacred. Many go their to pray,
treating it as a sanctified area. The coral walls here seem to the south and
up however, seem to have been recently sheered. This is in accordance with
the task of the Graendiaen Enginnering Group to widen the path of the
Crescent Current, also known to the natives here as 'The C'.

&+LArtifacts Laboratory&N~
     Within this room priceless artifacts are repaired, more or less, to
their original state. The Graendiaen officials spend much money to purchase
goods from the air-breathers to repair damage done to these objects. Yet
still it is not always enough, and a little 'ingenuity' must be used. Various
viles and molds rest upon the dozens or shelves that line the walls. The
arifacts room is to the south.

it only took it five generations of complaints before action was taken.

     Sand has managed to filter in through the crawlspace to the north that
leads to the Pjworn Fields. It attempts to cover the rough coral walls, but
with no success. The bright orange color clashes sharply with the brownish-
tan of the dirt, making it almost painful to look at. The chasm leads
upwards.

small creatures that created this grandious structure dare not show their
faces, hiding deep within its recesses. Mostly bright red in hue, the color
shifts with the current, ranging from a pale pink at one moment to a deep
scarlet the next. A part of the coral looks abit different than the rest.
It is a perfectly round slab that melts almost perfectly into the rest of
the coral.

     No bigger than most closests, a family of 5 has been forced to live here
ever since the recycling mill closed down a decade ago. Aparently, it had
been costing the company too many lives to go and recycle old shipwrecks, and
now many aquatics are unemployed and forced to float on streetcorners begging
for food and work. The only exit is to the north.
