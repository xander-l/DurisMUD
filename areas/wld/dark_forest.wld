&+LThis strange&n &+bphenomenna&n &+Lhas created a small gap in the forest canopy allowing

&+gAn&n &+yAncient Log~
The ancient log originally was a huge tree which dwarfed all those around it.
Now, however, only the shell remains. The log has been almost completely
hollowed out by the actions of time and of several thousand industrious
insects. Although the inside is very dark, a small amount of light filters in
through minute cracks and open knotholes, preventing it fram being pitch
black. The bottom of the log is carpeted by bits of half rotten wood and
sawdust and the sides are covered with moss and spider webs. Combined with
the sawdust, the moss efectively muffles the outside sounds. Several animals
have obviously used the log as a shelter and from the looks of it some are
still doing so. Many different tracks can be seen where water dripping down
has created damp spots in the sawdust.

&+LAlthough this would seem to be an ideal place for squirrels and other small
&+Lanimals of the forest to forage for food, there is no evidence that they do
&+Lso. Even the trees of the forest seem to stay out of range of the Oak tree,
&+Lwith no branches of any other tree touching the branches of the oak tree.
&+LThis strange&n &+bphenomenna&n &+Lhas created a small gap in the forest canopy allowing
&+Lthe&n &+wlight&n &+Lof the sun to reach the forest floor. At high noon on&n &+ymid-summer's&n
&+Lday, except when the sun is blocked by the clouds, this pattern of sunlight
&+Lcreates a&n &+yperfect circle&n &+Lof light around the perimiter of the Oak.

&+gA&n &+yKnothole&n &+gin an&n &+yAncient Log~
The ancient log originally was a huge tree which dwarfed all those around it.
Now, however, only the shell remains. The log has been almost completely
hollowed out by the actions of time and of several thousand industrious
insects. Although the inside is very dark, a small amount of light filters in
through minute cracks and open knotholes, preventing it fram being pitch
black. The bottom of the log is carpeted by bits of half rotten wood and
sawdust and the sides are covered with moss and spider webs. Combined with
the sawdust, the moss efectively muffles the outside sounds. A large knothole
in the log has made some creature a very cozy nest. Leaves have been piled up
to line the sides of the knothole and bits of fur and feathers have been
used to make it even cozier.

have obviously used the log as a shelter and from the looks of it some are
still doing so. Many different tracks can be seen where water dripping down
has created damp spots in the sawdust.

&+rA&n &+LTree&n &+rof&n &+LDea&+wth~
A large dead tree with many branches stands here slightly isolated from the
other trees. Impaled on the branches are the gruesome remains of numerous
corpses which have been left to rot. The corpses seem to be of a wide variety
of races and the remains of humans, elves, gnomes, and dwarves can be seen.
All have been ravished by birds and the various forest animals that have been
able to reach the bodies. Some of the corpses have completely decomposed and
their bones lie piled beneath the tree. Others are in various stages of
decomposion, some with missing body parts which have fallen off and now lie
on top of the pile of bones. Draped across one of the larger branches is the
corpse of a Centaur. This seems to have been very recently killed as it has
hardly decomposed at all, although its eyes have been pecked out by birds.

&+LAn&n &+rOgrillonian&n &+LEncampment~
&+gA forest of huts stretch off in all directions, making this section of the
&+gforest resemble an encampment. They are all made of branches and animal skins,
&+gwhich explains why there is no natural wildlife in this forest. The normal
&+gforest noise is drowned out by the shouting and fighting that be heard all
&+gover the encampment. The encampment continues into the darkness.

&+LAn&n &+rOgrillonian&n &+LHut~
The Ogrillon hut is crudely constructed out of barely tanned animal skins
stretched over bent tree branches. The floor is of dirt, which the smallest
amount of moisture turns to foul smelling muck. The hut is smallish but could
probably house six ogrillons if they were closely related. The roof in the
center reaches six feet but is about two feet lower around the edges. Around
the edges of the hut are piled rough straw mats. Some filty eating utensils
are heaped in one corner. Trash litters the floor, mixing in with the mud.

roots, enlarging the burrow so that it can be used as shelter for several of
the Spriggen warriors. Evidence of their occupancy is all around in the form
of small bits of bone, bloody fur, skin, half eaten food and other trash which
litter the burrow. One side of the burrow looks like it is used as sleeping
quarters from the clumps of moss piled there. The decaying bits of food give
the burrow a distinctive stench.

&+LThe Shamans&n &+yBurrow~
This burrow has been formed in the ground under a large tree between several
intersecting tree roots. Dirt has been dug out from some of the tree roots,
enlarging the burrow. Several tree stumps and large rocks have been brought
into the burrow to be used as tables. On one of the tree stumps is a deck of
tarot cards laid out as if someone had been giving a reading. There is a staff
leaning against a rock that is elaborately decorated with feathers which has
a mystical design burned into the wood.  A shaman's vestments are hung from
a protruding tree root.

&+claps at the statues feet. The statue depicts what appears to be a giant
&+mspriggan&n &+cwith its arms outstreched as if in the middle of casting a great
&+cspell. There are several smaller fragments of stone circling the base that
&+cperhaps once might have been statues, but time has erroded them into shapeless

&+LThe Patriarchs&n &+yBurrow~
This burrow has been formed in the ground under a large tree between several
intersecting tree roots. Dirt has been dug out from under the tree roots,
making the burrow very large. It is used as the residence of the village
patriarch. More care has been taken to keep it somewhat cleaner although
there are still heaps of trash littering the floor.  Hung on one side of the
burrow are the severed heads of three gnomes, each in differing stages of
decay. What's left of their bodies can be seen standing guard.

This ravine has been formed by the River Cu'L Torik which roars unseen far
below. A rickity swinging bridge crossing the ravine can be seen to the south.
The bridge looks extremely unsound and the framework of stakes attaching the
bridge to the edge of the ravine is very old and half rotted. Part of the
framework has almost pulled out of the ground and is kept from completely
pulling loose by several large boulders piled on top of it.
