&+gA Small Path Through a Forest~
&+L This forest path has rarly been used and is much overgrown. There are
&+Lmany small animals which scurry around the area playfull. The trees are an
&+Labove average size and seem very well nurished by mother nature. The under-
&+Lgrowth of the area rises to aproximatly four feet, leaving only the path for
&+Ltraveling. The area has many shadows which bring moss to the foot of trees
&+Land small insects to the moist ground. There path leads to the north and
&+Lsouth.

&+gA Path Through a Forest~
&+L Here lies a dirt path that winds in and out of the brush and through
&+Lthe trees. Along the path, mud puddles are a common sight to see along
&+Lwith the occaisional animal that hops about the path. The outlining brush
&+Lraise a few feet in the air and the trees tower up above the heads of most
&+Ltravelers. Common forest sounds echo through these woods from all over.
&+LShades of green and yellow span the canopy where many birds can be seen
&+LMaking nests, singing, and competing for mates.

&+gA Path Through a Forest~
&+L  The path continues here with many mud puddles as the capony thickens
&+Land the rain becomes much more dense. There's a faint scent of pollen in
&+Lthe air from the surrounding fermenting flowers. The scenary brings sights
&+Lof many of the common features of these mystical lands including those of
&+Lexotic plants and animals. The plant growth here is very well preserved
&+Lwith the plentiful rains and the height of the weeds shows it.

&+gA Path Through A Forest~
&+L The path curves here brining a huge puddle at the outside of the curve
&+Lwhich seems never to dry up. The plants around here seem very well off
&+Lwith the rains coming weekly and the nice warmth that the canopy provides.
&+LVarious vines span the area with prickly thorns keeping them from being
&+Leaten. Animals can be seen scurrying up trees as travelers walk through
&+Lthis area and the mosquito population seems very dense as many a traveler
&+Lwould say.

&+gA Path Through a Forest~
&+L The forest path comes out of a curve here and back into a straigh path
&+Lthrough the forest. The canopy brings much rain to this area as the plants
&+Lalong the path reach up to the waiste of many travelers and the trees sore
&+Lhigh into the sky and brings much heat. There are many large foot prints
&+Lin the mud around this area, as if the path is traveled a lot, by various
&+Ladventurers.

&+gA Small Grove~
&+L The path trails off here into a small grove that seems very well kept.
&+LThere is a small dirt path leading off to the east and west, and the
&+Lvegetation here has obviously not been hindered as many vines, weeds, and
&+Ltrees rise up into the canopy providing thousands of homes for the animals
&+Lof the forest. The sounds of small birds can be heard in several places
&+Laround here. Even the canopy seems to lessen in thickness, to allow the
&+Lmaximum growth of plants about the area.

&+L Coming off an intersection here, lies a path which runs through the high
&+Lbrush of this forest. The canopy brings shade, warmth, and homes to the
&+Lcreatures of this area. The path itself has many mud puddles and seems
&+Lfairly worn from travelers. The trees sore high into the sky, providing
&+Lan large amount of homes for small birds and reptiles which dwell in this
&+Larea.

&+gBack of The Grove~
&+L The grove here ends with a small clearing where animals gather at a very
&+Lsmall freshwater pool. There is a small hut here with a young man sitting
&+Lon one of the steps, dressed in the simplest of colors. He sits among many
&+Lof the forest creatures, who seem very friendly towards him. The air is
&+Lwarm and moist because of the small pool, which formed from a small creek
&+Lwhich runs out of sight into the woods. The hut itself looks made from
&+Lonly leaves, sticks, and other things one might find in the forest.

&+gA Dip in a Path~
&+L A huge whole in the ground here makes traveling along this path very
&+Ldifficult because of all the rain that collects in this small area. Even
&+Lthe surrounding ground is very slippery and will even cause a rock slide
&+Lsending wandering creatures into the mud. There is no room to walk around
&+Lthe huge puddle here, because of the thorny vines which outline the path.
&+LThe puddle also serves another purpose though, to provide a good water
&+Lsource for many forest dwelling creatures during times of need.

&+gA Path Through a Forest~
&+L  Coming out from a dip, the path keeps on winding through the forest here
&+Lwith much plant growth along the way and many forest creatures roaming the
&+Larea. The canopy starts to lessen in thickness further along allowing more
&+Lsunlight to hit the area, bringing a more variety of plants including some
&+Lbeautifully colored speckled flowers. Above all, the air seems pleasant to
&+Lmost people, providing a sence of peace and relaxation.

&+gBy A Huge Boulder~
&+L  The path stops short here by a huge boulder surrounded by plant life.
&+LEven the boulder is coverred in vines, mosses, and colorful fungi. The
&+Lpath here is starting to get grown over as not many things pass here to
&+Lthe boulder, however it makes a good hiding place for many small animals
&+Lwho seem to be hiding from something.

&+Lwhich spread out over the rocks, trees, and ground. Pollen is abundant in
&+Lin this area with many small working bees spreading it around, as well as
&+La variety of butterflies and other small insects. Spider webs can be found
&+Lnear some of the darker, more moist parts, ecspecially under the huge
&+Lvines, just waiting to catch a juicy bug.

&+gA Path Through a Forest~
&+L The path here is more sunny then others, since the canopy is so thin,
&+Land a larger variety of animals can be seen basking in the sun, enjoying
&+Lit to its finest. The only fungi, which is mainly moss, can only be seen
&+Lalong the dark shadows of the trees and under some of the rocks that do
&+Lnot get kicked along the path. The path itself is not as muddy as other
&+Lparts of the area because of the warm sun.

&+gAt a Small Hut~
&+L A Small hut, no higher than six feet in height, is here on stilts. The
&+Lground is very soggy, and the stilts of the hut keep it high and dry.
&+LThere are mainly ferns and weeds along this bog, and a few high trees
&+Lwhich surround the bog. The water is very mucky with algea covering the
&+Lsurface and lily pads floating around the area. The hut seems to be made
&+Lof a brown bamboo type wood and there's a small boat sitting along beside
&+Lthe hut.

&+Lmoss and mud. The path has been reinforced with stone blocks to keep mud
&+Lslidings from occuring. The canopy is almost totally gone as the path
&+Lcontinues, with only scattered tree tops. The air is more cool, and there
&+Lseems to be less evidence of rain as the path continues deeper into the

&+Lis used to much that small pebbles and stones have been spread along it
&+Lto keep down on the mud, and to keep the path from getting soggy. The
&+Lhuge vines don't seem to huge along here, and the trees are now an average

&+Lhere along with many small saplings. The air is fresh with pollen, and the

&+Lsmall dwellings for insects. The trees provide lovely shade along the path

&+Labout healthy plant and animal growth. The path is very sturdy here with
&+Lvery little mud along it. A small hole in a tree close to the path provides
&+La suitable dwelling for many animals and a damp dark spot for moss to grow

&+gA &+yBridge &+gOver a &+BStream~
&+L A bridge has been made here which allows passage over a fair size stream.
&+LThe bridge is made from a hard dark brown wood and has obvious wear.
&+LOver the years, supports have been added to the bridge to keep it from
&+Lbreaking. The stream is very clear, so clear infact that trout can be seen
&+Lswimming down stream. The area surrounding the stream is a very thick
&+Lbrush that barely anything can move through it's so thick. On each bank,
&+Lthere is a small box with a sign saying 'Contribution Box.'

  Mold and other nasty things underline the bridge as many undesirable
creatures have come here to take shelter for the night, trying to evade the
authorities from wherever they came from. Old campsite material and the such
can be seen scattered about the area left from previous travelers. The stream
runs under here with trout swimming along as well, providing a good fishing
place too. The ground is very moist and sometimes muddy during a rain storm.
Small bugs make their homes in the moist earth.
