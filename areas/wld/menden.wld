&+yBase of the Cliff Near a Pier&n~
   The trail down the cliff ends here at a rocky beach extending north and
south.  The rocks underfoot are partially made of volcanic rock, and are rather
crumbly, making footing difficult.  A small pier extends onto the water to the
west.

&+mA Well Kept House&n~
   This one-room house is decorated somewhat elaborately, contrary to the
spartan standards normal to Menden-on-the-Deep.  A mural depicting a green sea
serpent attacking a ship decorates one wall.  The mural has a legend below it.
Other furnishings include a carved furniture set, with a table and four chairs,
and a heavy-looking ceramic vase.  Glyphs are painted on the walls and floors,
leading to the conclusion that the owner must have some magical knowledge.
