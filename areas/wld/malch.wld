&+LRoughly Finished Tunnel&N~
&+L   The tunnel is untouched by tools of the rock trades.  The walls are as rough
&+Land natural as they were thousands of years ago.  The floor is covered with
&+Lmany sharp, jutting rocks that stick out in any which direction nature has
&+Lchosen them to.  The darkness is very deep here but one can see that the tunnel
&+Lcontinues on to the north.&N

&+LFurther Down the Dark Tunnel&N~
&+L   The tunnel is still very rough and unworked.  There are some slimy pools of
&+Lan unknown substance in many small holes in the floor.  This entire tunnel
&+Lsmells terribly bad, much like that giant filth filled lagoons common to the
&+Llarger cities of the surface.  There is a fair amount of food waste lying in
&+Lthe darkness of this tunnel.  One may travel to the north or south.&N

&+Lupon two pyramid like supports on each end.  The altar &+Mglows&+L and hums with an
&+Lsurreal magical enchantment.  Upon the altar is a large basin that is filled
&+Lwith blood and wine.  A large stone &+Wcross&+L hangs inverted from the ceiling of
&+Lthe room.  The room itself has been carved out of the stone very meticulously.
&+LThe walls have been polished smooth by the industrious dark clerics of the town
&+Lof &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L.  One may travel to the north into the main chamber of
&+gThazzo Holt&+L.

&+L   This library is the only collection of books in the whole &+ggoblin&N &+Lcity of
&+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L.  There are several different book cases that are filled with
&+Ldusty old tomes.  There is a round table in the middle of the room.  There are
&+Lseveral open tomes on the table and a large white candle that illuminates the
&+Lroom.  There are several small chair around the table, all made of some kind of
&+Lred wood.  This is the main library of the &+ggoblin&N &+Lclerics of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L.

&+LThe Main Study of the Headmaster of &+gGoblin&N &+LClerics&N~
&+L   This room pulsates with the unholy powers of the &+ggoblin&N &+Lclerical leader,
&+gTol'rah&+L. The room is well stocked with expensive looking furniture and banners
&+Lproclaiming the power of the &+ggoblin &+LDiety.  The walls are not smooth but cut
&+Lat wierd angles.  The surface of the walls has been so strangely crafted that
&+Lit seems to move out and in randomly.  This room is truly a powerful center of
&+Lunholy power.  There are some large, cushioned chairs along the walls and a
&+Lvery huge altar that is used by only the head priest.  There is an exit leading
&+Lto the east that connects this room to the main cavern of &+gThazzo Holt&+L.

&+LRoughly Cut Tunnel of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&N~
&+L   This tunnel has been roughly cut from the stone.  Several jagged edges of
&+Lstone reach down from the ceiling.  Any creature taller than a &+ggoblin&N &+Lcould
&+Lvery likely cut open their skull on these edges.  The tunnel has been cut in a
&+Lrectangular shape, roughly five feet high and four feet wide.  There is a lot
&+Lof &+ggoblin&N &+Lfeces smeared on the ground.  It appears that the inhabitants of
&+Lthese tunnels, caves and caverns care little in the way of sanitation.  The
&+Ltunnel leads to the north or south, depending upon which direction you are
&+Ltraveling.  There is a small home to your east.&N

&+Lsqualid at best.  The walls and floor are filthy and covered with an unknown
&+Lgrime.  There appears to be fresh stools of feces near the eastern tunnel
&+Lopening.  To the west the tunnel is considerably less filthy but by no means
&+Limmaculate.  The stench here is beyond revolting but what would you expect from
&+Lthe cold, stone tunnels of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L.  One can travel in any direction.&N

&+L   The narrow tunnel continues on to the northern parts of the city.  The
&+Lwalls have been very roughly cut here and look to be neglected.  Small chunks
&+Lof ceiling have fallen down into the walkway and some of the wooden support
&+Lbeams have been knocked down and lie strewn upon the ground.  There is a large
&+Lhole on the floor.  There is an iron grate over it so one can continue travels
&+Lwithout falling in.  It smells horrid and could make the toughest of &+BOgres&+L want
&+Lto plug their nose.  The central path of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L continues to the

&+LThe tunnel is somewhat larger than normal, about six feet by six feet.  Some
&+Lunholy &+crunes&+L and &+mglyphs&+L have been masterfully chiseled into the tunnel walls.

&+Lcomes from this tunnel.  The walls have been masterfully chiseled into the

&+Lstone.  Because the &+ggoblins&N &+Lwho use this tunnel are in charge of keeping
&+Lit maintained, this part of the tunnel complex has been well maintained.  The
&+Lwalls and ceiling of this tunnel are very clean.  The floor has some deeply
&+Lingrained stains that are impossible to clean.  This tunnel is by far the most
&+Lclean in the entire city for the unholy clerics constantly work to clear this

&+L   There is a big difference between dirty and squalid.  This section of the
&+Ldump is squalid for sure.  There is a lot of trash and garbage here.  From the
&+Lstalactite covered ceiling, a thick ooze is currently dripping.  There is a
&+Lthick layer of dirt and grime covering all the trash and corpses.  The corpses
&+Lare distinctly &+ggoblin&+L.  Some have even decomposed fully leaving only a &+Wwhite
&+Lskeleton.  Some of the bodies are still twitching.  One may travel north, south
&+Lor west.&N

&+LEastern Edge of the Disgusting Dumping Cavern of the &+gGoblins&N~
&+L  This part of the cavern is used by the &+ggoblins&+L of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L to dump both
&+Lbodily waste and trash they no longer need.  The sheer amount of garbage here
&+Lis almost unfathomable.  The piles have been pushed up against the cavern wall
&+Lin a feeble effort to create more room for dumping.  If the &+ggoblin&+L people do
&+Lnot do something to curb their garbage production, this cavern will soon be
&+Labsolutely filled with this smelly trash.  There are several decomposed bodies
&+Lshowing the whites of their bones.  This dump smells as bad as it looks.  One

&+L   Small rats scurry in and out of the garbage.  There is a unreal amount of
&+Ltrash, filth, grime and corpses here in the dump of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L.   The
&+Lsmell here is thoroughly revolting.  The cavern wall is covered with a thick
&+Llayer of what appears to be dried feces.  The ceiling is covered with small
&+Lstalactites that appear to be comprised of much instead of stone.  One may

&+Lthe &+ggoblin&+L corpses from the city.  The stone wall of the cavern is covered

&+LThe Revolting Edge of the &+GGoblin&N &+LDump&N~
&+L   The amount of garbage that is in this stone cavern is unbelievable.  There
&+Lis thousands of tons of trash and waste dumped here.  Hundreds and maybe even
&+Lthousands of years have passed by with the limited amount of decomposing that
&+Lthe underdark offers.  Amidst all the trash and filthy waste are several grey
&+Lcorpses of &+ggoblins&N &+Land &+rduergar&+L dwarves.  The &+ggoblin&N &+Ldoesn't particularly
&+Lcare about the dead.  The bodies were tossed in here just as any other type of
&+Ltrash.  One can see a few &+ggoblin&N &+Lbabies amongst the garbage either badly
&+Ldeformed or decapitated by the angry fathers. One may travel to the north, east

&+Lin several places.  This is a huge cavern and if the &+ggoblins&+L weren't such dirty

&+Lquickly here with help from the various parasites help but many more are as
&+Lthey were a decade before as no natural forces are allowed to break down the

&+L   This tunnel is very dangerous to walk in.  The support beams here have

&+Lcut by the various mining tools that the people took from the many dwarven
&+Lmining expeditions they slaughtered nearly three thousand years ago.  Not that
&+Lany &+ggoblin&N &+Lwould remember that.  &+gGoblin&N &+Lhistory is usually rewritten again

&+LEntering a Long, Naturally Formed Cavern&N~
&+L   How the ancient &+ggoblins&+L found this naturally formed cavern is beyond
&+Lmost of the wisest in all the realms comprehension.  The tunnel that lead here
&+Lfrom the south has perfectly met the edge of the cavern.  The tunnel has met
&+Lthe cavern at a perfect right angle and only scarred the natural cavern where
&+Lthe entrance cut into the stone.  The cavern floor has formed into a smooth
&+Lsurface with little to no help from the &+ggoblin&+L miners.  The caverns ceiling
&+Lis located over twenty feet over the surface of the floor.  One can see several
&+Lstalactites hanging down.  The cavern continues to the east.&N

&+L   This naturally formed cavern is filled with naturally formed stalactites
&+Land stalagmites made from solid stone.  The stalactites are much larger than
&+Lits cousins on the floor.  They hang over a dozen feet from the ceiling and
&+Lend in a very sharp point.  The stalagmites have very wide bases and stand at
&+Lnearly seven feet.  The cavern is very wide at this point offering free range
&+Lof movement to all creatures, even the largest giants.  This cavern is only
&+Lused by &+ggoblins&+L however as this is a main avenue in the city of &+gMalch'hor
&+gGanl&+L.  The caverns have been soiled by the careless inhabitants of the town.

&+Labout breaking them off and having pretend sword fights.  Several such rocky
&+Lspears lie strewn about the ground.  The cavern walls are uneven and offer many

&+Lsharp edges.  This tunnel is obviously used primarily for real and useful
&+Lpurposes as opposed to a display of aesthetic beauty.  The tunnel continues to
&+Lthe north and south.&N

&+LIn the Lower Tunnels of the &+gGoblin &+LCity of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&N~
&+L   The tunnel is tight and without any lights.  It is very smelly down here in
&+Lthe lower regions of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L.  The tunnel is tight and cramped but
&+Loffers easy passage for all the &+ggoblins&+L who live at the end of this tunnel.
&+LThe walls are rough and full of sharp edges.  The rock is a very dark type that
&+Lretains the heat of the city well.  One may travel to the south or up.&N

&+LTurn in the &+gGoblin&N &+LMade Tunnel&N~
&+L   This tunnel has been carved rather well.  It turns abruptly here to join
&+Lwith yet another section of tunnel.  The tunnel walls are rough and have sharp
&+Ledges.  There are small paintings that have been painted by the &+ggoblin&+L children
&+Lwho had an artistic side.  The paintings are of warriors in battle and also
&+Lsmall bats flying.  The smell here is overwhelming.  There is a fair amount of
&+Lgarbage and trash lying strewn about the floor.  The tunnel continues to the
&+Least and there is a set of stairs leading down.&N

&+L   This dark tunnel reaks of the terrible smells of &+ggoblin&+L waste.  There
&+Lare many signs of life at the end of this tunnel as there are many tracks in
&+Lthe filth.  The tunnel walls are rough here as the rest of the walls down this
&+Lside tunnel.  In the distance you can here the echoes of battle and cheers
&+Lcutting through the unbearable silence.  It seems that there is a competition
&+Lgoing on somehwere near.  One may travel to the north or west.&N

&+LIn the Narrow Tunnel Above the &+gGoblin&+L Warrior Training Rooms&N~
&+L   This narrow section of tunnel is above the only entrance to the school of
&+ggoblin&+L warriors.  The tunnel was only partially dug further north but the
&+Lnatural cavern below made that very unneeded.  The tunnel walls are very rough
&+Llooking and unfinished as the asthetics of tunnels such as these are very
&+Lunimportant.  The floor is very rough and the stone juts out at strange angles.
&+LOne may travel down into the school or south through the tunnels.&N

&+L   This large central room is part natural cavern and partly carved from the
&+Lstone.  The black rock has been polished to a shine by the undergraduates of
&+Lthe school.  The glory of the &+ggoblin&+L warriors is on display here in the
&+Lmany stone statues of the greatest warriors to come from this school.  Although
&+Lsome warriors came to fame without the aid and lessons learned from this school
&+Lit is a rare feat indeed.  The school has instilled many valuable lessons to
&+Lthe students that have come through the ranks here.  To the west is the first
&+Lroom of warrior training.  The second room is to the south, the third room is
&+Lto the east and the final room is to the north.  One may exit the school by
&+Lgoing up.&N

&+Lrecruits finally are allowed to practice their full skills against each other
&+Lor even, for the better students, against the masters themselves.  There are
&+Lseveral&+R blood&+L stains on the ground from previous battles.  The most important
&+Llessons are learned here, lessons of controlled rage, of fearlessness, of

&+Lthe east.  This room is used by the teachers of the school to instill the
&+Lvarious lessons of using a shield in battle.  There are several small shields
&+Lhanging from the walls on either side.  The importance of shields to &+ggoblin&N
&+Lwarriors is paramount if they want to try to knock down any smaller opponents
&+Lthey face.  The main room of the warriors school is to the west.&N

&+LThe room is roughly circular offering no corners to cower in.  There is no
&+Lfurniture in this room at all.  In fact, the only object in this room is the
&+Lsmall rothe-skin rug that covers roughly half of the floor.  The walls are not
&+Lsmooth by any means but have been chiseled free of any overly sharp edges.
&+LThis room is used to teach the &+ggoblin&+L warriors to fight furiously in the
&+Lwidest open place they can, for in a corner a &+ggoblin&+L warrior could easily be
&+Loverwhelmed by a larger opponent.  The exit of this room is to the east.&N

&+L   This room is very similar to the first room of warrior training in that
&+Lit is round and without furniture.  This room, however, is well stocked with
&+Lmany different types of weapons.  Flails, swords and maces are the primary
&+Lweapons used by the more advanced students of the &+ggoblin&+L school but most of
&+Lthe warriors here start out with simple clubs.  It is very important for all
&+ggoblin&+L warriors to remember that they are not large enough to wield the
&+Llarger weapons that are available.  One may travel out of this room be going
&+Lnorth into the main chamber of the warrior school.&N

&+L   This tight side tunnel has started above the main body of the long natural
&+Lcavern of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L.  The tunnel is a tight squeeze indeed as the
&+Lpassageway is a mere three feet across.  The tunnel has a large pile of some
&+Lsick looking filth that is a combination of feces and vomit.  The air around
&+Lyou smells very bad as you are in the higher parts of the cavern.  There is a
&+Llong set of stone stairs that leads back down to the caverns floor.  One may
&+Ltravel into the tight tunnel by going south.&N

&+L   This tunnel has been better crafted than the other side tunnels in the city
&+Lof &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L.  The creators of this tunnel did not use the conventional
&+Ltools used to dig, they used magic.  The walls and ceiling are just as flat as
&+Lthe perfectly flat floor.  The stone has a very glassy finish as if the stone
&+Lwas melted by an intense heat.  The tunnel continues to the north.  There is a

&+La stone archway carved from the stone that has been very well detailed by the
&+Lseveral expert artisans that work for the school of &+gGana Matak&+L.  The archway
&+Lglows with a magic unknown outside of the school.  The tunnel has very smooth
&+Lwalls and floor.  The surfaces hae a very smooth finish as well because they
&+Lhave been painted with a clear substance that allows the stone to retain its
&+Lnatural power.  The school of shamans is located directly south.  The tunnel
&+Lback to the main part of &+gMalch'hor Ganl&+L is to the north.&N
