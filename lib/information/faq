                  &+GDuris Frequently Asked Questions&n


&+RQ: When will the MUD be finished?&n
&+gA: There is no such thing as a finished mud.  Duris is constantly expanding
&+g   and changing, and will never stop doing so.&n

&+RQ: Is player killing, stealing, corpse looting allowed?&n
&+gA: Hell yes!  Duris is a FULL pkill MUD, this includes all of those things.&n 

&+RQ: Are we allowed to multiplay or create robot characters?&n
&+gA: No, and you will be subject to punishment when you are caught.

&+RQ: What is a "Mob"?&n
&+gA: "Mob" is short for "Mobile", which refers to any monster or NPC (non 
&+g   player character).&n

&+RQ: What if I find a bug?&n
&+gA: You MUST report it via petition at ONCE.  If you do not get a response,
&+g   post it on the forums or petition one of the gods.  You can also use the
&+g   'bug' command.&n

&+RQ: Are there death traps on Duris?&n
&+gA: No, there are no rooms that instantly kill you and then take all your 
&+g   equipment with no chance of you or anyone else ever getting them back.
&+g   However, there ARE rooms with no exits that you must get summoned out
&+g   of.  There ARE rooms that are so deadly that you will die as soon as
&+g   you walk in, to some VERY powerful/nasty mob, or a room that traps you,
&+g   or causes you to fall to your death.  But in EVERY case, it is possible
&+g   for someone to be able to rescue you or retrieve your corpse.  However,
&+g   there are ways to lose your corpse, such as dying behind an unpickable
&+g   door with the key and not returning before the zone pops.&n

&+RQ: How do I add areas to Duris?&n
&+gA: The first step is to download Duris' zone editor and learn how to use it.
&+g   Then you need to pitch your zone idea to the current zone god first,
&+g   just to make sure you aren't going to be wasting your time writing a
&+g   zone that would never get approved.  After the zone is written, you
&+g   must submit it, wait for it to be reviewed, wait for it to be tweaked/
&+g   balanced, and wait for it to be connected to the MUD.  The zone you
&+g   submit will almost certainly NOT be identical to the zone that winds up
&+g   on the MUD (mobs and equipment always inevitably get changed for a 
&+g   variety of reasons).

&+RQ: What is an asterisk (*) beside a player's or mob's name mean?
&+gA: It means the player or mob is invisible, and you obviously have some form
&+g    of detect invisibility cast upon you since you can see it.

&+RQ: If my link dies and I cannot reconnect, what do I do?
&+gA: Suffer....there is nothing we can do about bad links or any connection
&+g   problems, that's a risk we all take when we mud.  Duris will auto-rent you
&+g   after a short time if you do not reconnect. 

&+RQ: I died, can a god help me?
&+gA: Under NO circumstance is ANY god allowed to help you if you died to a 
&+g   normal part of the game.  If a bug or a god causes your death, then
&+g   yes they can help you.&n
   
&+RQ: What if I feel something is out of balance?&n
&+gA: Ah, well then leave a message in the bug, idea or typo commands or email
&+g   it to a high ranking god.  You are our eyes and ears and we take your
&+g   messages very seriously, please write your opinions and suggestions.&n
   
&+RQ: What if I think a god is cheating?
&+gA: Duris is run by regular people who have all played as mortals sometime
&+g   in the past and/or present.  Accusing a god of cheating is VERY serious,
&+g   not something to be thrown around without any proof and simply because
&+g   you are angry about something in the game.  IF you do have proof a god
&+g   is cheating, contact a god you do trust immediately, either by petition,
&+g   telling them, or by email.&n 

&+RQ: Will I run out of things to do on Duris?
&+gA: Only if you never leave the hometowns!  Duris is prehaps the largest mud 
&+g   on the Internet in terms of areas and has a huge playerbase, plus there
&+g   is full racewars/pkill so there should always be something to do.  But
&+g   it's up to you to get out there and explore the world!&n

&+RQ: Trips are long and I get tired.  Can I increase my movement?&n
&+gA: Duris is a HUGE world, and getting tired on long trips from zone to zone
&+g   is a normal part of life.  Get yourself a mount, bum a fly spell off a 
&+g   mage, or take a cleric/druid/bard with you.&n

&+RQ: Why can't I toggle anonymous and what does it do?&n
&+gA: Anonymous was removed from the game, but used to hide your class and race
&+g   from others on the who list.

&+RQ: How do I know if I am close to levelling?&n
&+gA: Type exp while not in battle, it will give you a general idea as to how
&+g   close you are to your next level. 

&+RQ: Can I be transferred?&n
&+gA: Not without a good reason. 

&+RQ: I'm low level and the things I kill don't have money.  How can I get some?
&+gA: As in real life asking others for help is a good start.  Other than that
&+g   you can scavenge and sell items you find on the ground.  When you get 
&+g   higher in levels, the mobs you kill will have money and equipment.

&+RQ: My sword was dropped accidentally and it sank.  What can I do?
&+gA: Your sword has been lost to the Sea Kingdom.  To retrieve it, you must
&+g   complete this zone.&n

&+RQ: I have a spell that sounds really cool, how can I find out what it really
&+R   does?
&+gA: Type help spellname where spellname is the name of the spell you now have.

&+RQ: I have a serious problem, what do I do?
&+gA: Read ALL the help files first, and type NEWS and motd.  If that still does
&+g   not give you the answer to your problem, ask another player, if they dont
&+g   know, then as a LAST resort, type petition whatever and a god will answer
&+g   you IF one is on and not busy doing something else or idle. 

&+RQ: I'm new here, how do I find out how to play?
&+gA: Type help and go from there.  Help commands and help newbie are also good
&+g   places to start.  If you are TOTALLY lost, you can petition for help,
&+g   but this does not always ensure a response as the immortals are often
&+g   very busy.&n

&+RQ: I have an item, how do I find out what it does?
&+gA: There are many shops in the Realms which sell scrolls of identification
&+g   which you can use.  You can type "recite scroll  <item name>.  If you're
&+g   buddies with a conjurer, get her to identify it for you.  Or, you can
&+g   enter your locker at a bank, and use the 'stat <item>' command.

&+RQ: How can I find areas in which to adventure?
&+gA: Type credits to see a semi-complete list of zones on the mud.  White 
&+g   markers on the wilderness map are zone markers, check them out.&n

&+RQ: I died and I am far from my corpse can someone get my equipment from me?
&+gA: Of course, if you trust them.  Anyone can loot your corpse, so its a good
&+g   idea to get back to it ASAP! 

&+RQ: How do I change what channels I can hear or the display I see?
&+gA: You can see which things you can change by typing "toggle" or "display".

&+RQ: What is GCC?
&+gA: It's how guilds members talk to each other, type gcc then whatever you
&+g   want to say, and if any of your fellow guild members are on (assuming
&+g   you are level 25 and in a guild) they will hear it.
