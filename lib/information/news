&+L- Experience is now split among the group, so the bigger the
&+L  group is the less exp you get from each kill. But the smaller
&+L  the group is the faster you trophy out on mobs and have to
&+L  move around more.&n

&+WWe hope you all enjoy this new wipe and that there will be lots of action!&n
