#
AC "ARMOR CLASS" (General Information)
===========================================================================
The lower your character's AC (acronym for "Armor Class"), the less chance
he or she will have of getting injured by physical attacks. Armor class
numbers often run into the negatives (good!) and it is not uncommon for an
extremely high-level player to have -100 AC.

Examples:
   100          Naked person
     0          Heavily armored
   -51          Very heavily armored
  -100          Nigh-unhittable

NOTE: Within the mud code, armor classes are actually calculated on a -10
to 10 scale. Why? Because THAC0's are calculated on a 0-20 scale, and thus
must be equated against a -10 to 10 armor class scale instead of a -100 to
100 scale. What does this mean to you? It means that as far as the mud is
concerned, if you have, for instance, a -55 armor class, you *really* only
have a -50 armor class. The values are all rounded off to the closest ten.
So, when you are choosing your equipment, disregard those few extra armor
class points unless they take you over the next 10th number value.

The help entry under THAC0 further explains this hit/miss system.

#
ALCHEMIST (Sub-Class of: Magic-User)

Alchemists are a class that can make things out of seemingly mundane
materials. They have the ability to craft items of all types including body
armor, rings, bracelets, etc. They also have the ability to forge weapons.
In addition to crafting and forging they can mix potions and throw them at
their enemies and at higher levels they are said to be capable of creating
scrolls and the ability to magically enhance items.   

Allowable races: 	Human, Gnome, Goblin, Orc.  		
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, alchemists have their
                        own specific item restrictions. They are restricted
                        in their use of weapons, mainly using maces, clubs
                        and staves. Some exceptions are allowed, however.
                        They can wear almost any type of armor, but are
                        mildly restricted in the use of miscellaneous
                        magical items.

#
ALIGNMENT (General Information)
===========================================================================
Your character's alignment (GOOD, NEUTRAL or EVIL) will govern how he or
she reacts to other players and/or monsters. The following is an outline of 
the alignment system:

&+WGOOD (350 to 1000)&n is the most prone to change (i.e., the hardest to
maintain). Killing other good-aligned players and monsters will harm it the
most, but killing neutrals can shift it towards evil as well.

&+GNEUTRAL (-349 to 349)&n is affected most by killing non-extreme
alignments (i.e., other neutrals). Killing extremes such as 1000 and -1000
is just maintaining the balance, and will have no effect on your alignment.

&+REVIL (-350 to -1000)&n is the most difficult to change. Almost anything
an evil person kills can be considered (at best) a neutral act, but it is
most likely the kill will just serve to make the person more evil. Only by
killing things more evil than oneself can one creep up out of the pit.

Alignment ranges from -1000 to 1000. Due to the way alignment works, before 
long your alignment will actually reflect your playing style, and will not 
fluctuate much unless you change your playing style drastically.

#
ANSI COLORS (General Information)
===========================================================================
Duris is a world of color and in order to better understand how to add
color to certain things (such as guild titles) you need to know the ANSI
codes for it.

There are 3 basic types of ANSI color control sequences:

	&+<color>  -Sets the foreground color. If the letter is
                      uppercase, the color is bold.
	&-<color>  -Sets the background color. If the letter is
		      uppercase, the text will blink. 
	&=<bg><fg> -Sets both background <bg> and foreground <fg> color,
                      exactly as setting the background and foreground
                      separately.

Each color is specified using a letter. Black is L, red is R, cyan is C,
blue is B, white is W, green is G, yellow is Y, and magenta is M. To
specify the bright version of the color use the uppercase letter; for the
dark color, use the lowercase letter.

The actual colors themselves are as follows:

	&+WBright    &+LDark          &+WBright    &+LDark&n
	&+w--------------------------------------&n
	&+LBlack     &+lBlack         &+WWhite     &+wWhite&n
	&+RRed       &+rRed           &+GGreen     &+gGreen&n
	&+CCyan      &+cCyan          &+YYellow    &+yYellow&n

BERSERK (Skill)
===========================================================================
Syntax:         berserk

Berserk represents a massive adrenaline rush and more or less mindless
rage, that has the following affects:

	Strength and Constitution increase.
	Dexterity and Agility decrease.
	Intelligence and Wisdom decrease.

As a result, you will most likely gain hits and do more damage. These 
changes to stats are based on your natural abilities and bonuses from
magic items or spells apply normally. This is one of the ways a stat can
exceed the 1-100 limit.

If you wish, you can start or stop a berserker rage by typing 'berserk',
level and skill heavily affect the results  f doing this. If a mob or
player walks into a room while you are berserked and not engaged in battle
at the time, you will automatically attack them. When berserk wears off,
you will lose the bonus hitpoints from Constitution and if this drops you 
below -10 hitpoints, you will die.
===========================================================================

#
BERSERKER (Sub-Class of: Fighter)
===========================================================================
Howling Screams, whirling whips, snacking on danger and dining on death. 
Berserkers attack in a focused battle rage that can grant them many
advantages on the battlefield. While at the same time their style tends to
be sloppier than that of warriors. Hence they tend to take more damage and
lack some skills with the shield. Many have been known to wield 2 handed
weapons with a fury almost unmatched. Their rage tends to focus themselves
totally on a single target at a time. So while in their younger years they
tend to attack more than warriors. As they age, they finally learn that
sometimes you must switch whom you fight. Bards sing of rumors that some
Berserkers have found a way to increase their size. If these stories are
true or not, it is not truly known. They are said to pray to the ancient
gods of the Nordic Lands. Such names as Odin, Loki, Thor, Beretorn, and
Kvasir. What powers are granted by these beings is a closely guarded
secret. Only the ancient dervish knows the true power that can be
unleashed. He dominates the Raven Realms dealing out death to those that
dare travel where they were never meant to be.

Allowable races:    Orc, Human
Equipment usage:    Like all classes on Duris, Berserkers have their own
                    item restrictions. They can use most heavy armor and
                    Non-slashing weapons but are more limited in using
                    magical items.

#
CAST (General Information)
===========================================================================
Syntax: cast '<spell>' [<object> | <victim> ]

"Cast" is a command used to indicate that a spell is being created. It is
the act of invoking the gods or calling upon magical powers inside the
individual. Some spells may only be cast on the caster, and therefore you
do not need to indicate a target for the spell. If you are casting a spell
upon yourself, you may substitute for your name "me" or "self." All spell
names must be enclosed by ' '. For Magic-User subclasses, you must have a
spellbook containing the spell you want to cast in order to memorize it.
For Priest sub-classes, you may simply pray for your spells. Undeads, 
except for Gargoyles, must assimilate spells. Finally, Druids regain their
spells by communing them.

Examples:       cast 'burning hands' <victim>
                cast 'teleport'
                cast 'strength' me

If you are casting an offensive spell while in combat, and the target is
the enemy you are fighting, the spell will automatically be directed at the
enemy without having to define a target.

There is help available for each individual spell (see examples below).

Examples:      	help "cure light"
                help "minor creation"
                help "energy drain"

NOTE:  You can abbreviate the spell name when casting it.  For example,

                > cast 'lightning bolt' <monster>

                could be abbreviated as:

                > cast 'ligh' <monster>

You must be careful however when abbreviating to insure that the correct
spell is cast because many spells have similar names and the abbreviations
may not be obvious at once. Experimentation in a safe forum is the best
idea to insure that no disasters occur.

#
CASTER (General Information)
===========================================================================
"Caster" is a term that is used to described "Magic-User" and "Priest"
classes. It is used in referring to classes that are highly adept in the 
magical arts and who focus their studies solely on these crafts. Casters 
include Clerics, Conjurers, Warlocks, Ethermancers, Druids, Necromancers, 
Shamans, Psionicists, Illusionists and Sorcerers. Casters receive no 
penalties to their casting abilities.

The term "Semi-Caster" denotes an entirely different set of classes who, 
while not being as proficient in the magical arts, do dabble in the mystic 
areas. Because they do not devote their lives to the practice of magic, 
they have special hindrances. While being able to use many of the same 
spells as casters, semi-casters can only hold half the number of spells in
their repertoire that a caster of same level can. In addition, because they 
are not as trained in magic, they find it a bit more difficult to memorize 
their incantations and to call on their deities for divine powers. Hence, 
semi-casters must take a little additional time in preparing their magic. 
Semi-casters include Anti-Paladins, Paladins, Rangers, Reaver, Bards and
Unholy-Pipers.

CENTAUR (General Information)
===========================================================================
Centaurs are a half horse, half human race, with the upper half looking
like a human, and the lower half looking like a large draft horse. Centaurs
are quiet, forest dwelling creatures from a far off forest covered land.
Centaurs are a good race, and thus will be on the good side of the race
wars on Duris. Being a seclusive race, centaurs are shy and slow to trust.
Because of this, only their own race and those of the elven and half-elven
race may enter their hometown. All other races are considered invaders,
and will be attacked on sight!

Centaur class list: Warrior, Ranger, Druid, Shaman.

Stats: Centaur are a very powerful race and have both great strength and
       hearty constitution. Being 1/2 horse, they can out-distance any
       other race in the world, being able to travel miles a day without
       growing tired. They are not known for their wit or wisdom however
       and thus seldom dabble in the mystic arts. They do however make
       decent Druids and Shamans, due to their high constitution. Centaur
       are so good with the bow that they gain a +2 to hit and a +1 on
       damage, due to their great strength. Their flighty nature and
       attunement with their environment allows them to be always AWARE and
       thus it is difficult to backstab them.

Centaur innate abilities: infravision, doorkick, stampede

Weakness: Centaurs are a flighty race by nature, and thus ALWAYS flee when
          they hear the roar of a dragon, and in fact, flee quite a lot.
          Also, given their odd body shape, Centaur cannot bash nor can
          they BE based by any race, save the Ogre, due to his great size
          and strength. Centaur can't wear anything on their legs, and can
          only wear horseshoes on their feet. They can however wear a ring
          on their tail.

Centaur have been known to sometimes allow their close friends to ride on 
their backs, but they must be wearing a saddle, and give consent.

"CHANNEL" (Spell)
===========================================================================
Channel is one of the most powerful s ells of a cleric and should be used
with great caution. It requires four clerics over level 50 to work, and
creates an avatar bringing the power of all the clerics together. First,
all the clerics must be grouped and consenting to "lead" cleric. They begin
casting the spell together until the avatar appears. The lead cleric then
takes control of the avatar, while the other clerics can simply watch. The
actual body of the clerics are left laying asleep where they are, but the
"lead" cleric, in avatar form, can move around, cast, etc.  

Warning: If ANY one of the clerics loses link during the avatar process,
the avatar will vanish. There IS a time limit on how often clerics can
avatar.

CHANTS (General Information)
===========================================================================
Chanting is a talent developed by monks used to further enhance their
martial arts skills. There are a number of different chants available to
monks, all varying in power and purpose.

Heroism -Heroism elevates the amount of adrenaline produced by the chanter 
and stimulates the centers of the mind controlling dexterity and balance, 
resulting in increased combat abilities. For the follower of the 'Way of
the Snake' this rush of adrenaline also increases speed and movement while
the Dragon Disciples become immune to fear.

Calm -Calm soothes whoever or whatever might be angry at the chanter or 
his friends. This chant has the capability of ceasing combat in certain 
situations.

Quivering Palm -This chant causes the chanter's hand to vibrate so fast it 
can barely be seen. The hand then strikes out at equally fast speeds, 
inflicting formidable damage upon its target.

Cell Adjustment -The chant allows the monk to rearrange the cellular
makeup of his body to his own liking. This comes in handy when afflicted 
with various maladies.

Regenerate -When chanting Regenerate, the monk heals at a much faster
rate.

Buddha Palm -Buddha Palm, much like Quivering Palm, causes the monk's
hands to vibrate at unbelievable speeds. However, the Buddha Palm strikes
out with both hands at lightning speed at as many adversaries as it can.

CHARING "CITY OF ELVES"
===========================================================================
Charing is a small quiet forest community set in the northeastern corner of
Evermeet Continent that welcomes Elf, Centaur and Half-elf visitors. What
it lacks in size it makes up in beauty. Massive oak tress filled with
birds, small creatures and sparkling rivers make for the most serene 
setting. In the southeast section of the forest stands the Great Tree of 
Charing. Here is your gateway to the city above.

The Palace of the City of Charing is the host for many of the Elven 
dignitaries. Towering behind a pair of impressive gates, the spires are

also the center of town. Heading down the east trail takes you past several
entertainment areas. You have the Grovetree Theatre, the home of the
renowned Grovesinger's Troupe, who are said to give the highest quality of
performance almost anywhere. After the performance shop by and let Nelanna
serve up some of the local brew.

Continuing down the trail is the Tower of High Magic. Hundreds of students 
a year stop here hoping to study with the most respected sorceress 
Morlyntra and her brother conjurer Morlander. When the hunger strikes you, 
head back to the west of the trail and stop by The Blue Dragon Restaurant.
Gaston Reglia the master chef is noted for his elegant meals and the 
seating is limited! West of the restaurant is the Rangers guild. A small 
wooden structure that offers Rangers from all around a safe place to train 
and hold council. If you would like to join them in their daily hunts, 
Alkatia's Fletcher shop just south of the fountain offers a fine selection
of longbows, arrows and quivers. Keep going south of Alkatia's and you'll
find the Bank of Charing and finally you can settle the end of the day at
the Olde Inn of Charing across the street.

listed below the headings of each one.

CODER (General Information)
===========================================================================
Coders of the MUD are a series of self correcting algorithms, usually the
process is started by a smaller script such as the "Alver", "Dvorak" or 
"Nokz" scripts. These work fine for most features but occasionally enter 
higher level functions and cause additional "features" which then need to 
pass through the "Tharkun" or "Ilienze" functions which restore the 
functions to their original code then rewrite them from scratch. The fabled 
Foo is a mostly unknown to Duris, but oddly his name is scratched to the 
bottom of each boat. If a Foo appears, most coder scripts will accept his 
function calls, except the "Kvark".

COMMUNE (Skill)
===========================================================================
Unlike most spellcasters, Druids do not need to memorize or pray. They have
allied themselves with the natural world so well that they commune with 
their surroundings to derive the natural essence that is necessary for
their spells. This essence is more abundant in untamed wilds. What this
means is, Druids will regenerate their spells, while standing, at a rate that 
varies dependent on what terrain they are in.

Type 'commune' for a list of spells that are being regenerated back.

CONJURER (Sub-Class of: Magic-User)
===========================================================================
Conjurers are the creative branch of the magic-users. They specialize in
enchantments, conjuring creatures and objects. They  re the only ones able
to identify objects. Conjurers, like other magic-users, possess awesome
spell casting might and are able to throw some of the world's most potent
spells. The conjuring style of magic first developed among the mixed breed
races, which would account for their smaller spell list and greater overall
spell potency.

Allowable races:        Human, Gnome, Grey Elf, Drow Elf, Orc, Goblin,
			Githyanki, Lich, Half Elf, Phantom, Shade.
Equipment usage:  	As all classes on Duris, Conjurers have their own
                        classification of item restriction. They have a
                        very small range of weapons they can use and a
                        small range of armor to choose from. They have very
                        little restrictions on what miscellaneous magical
                        items they can use, though.

CRAFTING
===========================================================================
Crafting is one of the primary skills of the Alchemist Class. By collecting
material pieces	from the corpses of dead mobs an alchemist can craft a wide 
range of equipment that can be used or sold at shops. 

Crafting explained:

With 1 material piece you can create small things like rings, earrings, etc.
With 2 material pieces you can create medium sized things like leggings,
       arm-plates, etc
With 3 material pieces you can create large items like cloaks and body
       armor.

Now you have your materials now what do you do? Select the materials you
want to use place them into your inventory and type:

     craft material object-type.
     
For example, if you have "a cracked magical gold piece" in your inventory
and type "craft gold ring" you may end up with a ring called "a crude
unique gold ring". 

Identifying the item after it is created will show you the stats. The
quality of the material used, your skill in crafting and your current level
all play a part in how powerful your newly crafted equipment becomes. We
are not giving out material formulas as it is a closely guarded alchemist
secret and nobody wants a guild of alchemists on their back.

undead state, killing anything that will satisfy its rage at what has been
done to it.

Allowable races:       Anti-paladin, Warrior, Mercenary.

Death knight stats:    Unlike Liches, Death Knights wear heavy armor and 
                       the weapons of warriors. They will usually be riding
                       a nightmare which they often summon to do their
                       bidding.

#
DREADLORD (Sub-Class of: Fighter)
===========================================================================
Dreadlords, also knows as the Eyeless, are the warlords of the undead. They
are the result of a dark and terrible ritual performed on a person. The end
of the ritual is marked by the person sacrificing his eyes by clawing them
out and then giving his life to the Dark Lords. If he is deemed worthy he
will once again rise, this time as an undead, a Dreadlord. If he is not
deemed worthy he has an eternity in the pits of hell to ponder his
arrogance. The loss of their eyes does not, as many believe, encumber the
Eyeless in any way. Instead they are giving a seventh sense by which they
can perceive their surroundings. This also makes them immune against
blindness and other things that would normally affect eyesight, such as
daylight and darkness, yet sensitive to extremes of heat. A Dreadlord is a
feared fighter, a master in the use of two-handed weapons, spreading the
taint of the dead as they fight. Even their blood can kill. They are also
trained in the art of leading and are deadly while commanding a force.  

Allowable races:        Lich, Vampire, Shade.
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Dreadlords have their
                        own item restrictions. They can use most heavy
                        armor and weapons but are more limited in using
                        magical items.
Innate Abilities:	Acid Blood, Inability to Blind.

===========================================================================
Area of effect: Caster and player(s)

The spell dream travel is a VERY powerful teleportation type spell. Casting
this spell on a player causes the caster to fall asleep and dream of his 
destination and when the caster wakes up he has arrived in most cases at
whom he dreamed of. If the caster casts this spell on themselves every
one in their group not in combat that has consented the caster will 
fall into a deep sleep causing them to dream of the caster and after 
wakening they will be in the same room as the caster.

syntax: cast 'dream travel' playername -to travel to any player on your
        side of the race wars.

        members to travel to your location.

#
DROP (Command)
===========================================================================
Syntax:        drop <object>

If you find you no longer need an item, or if you accidentally pick up the
wrong one, you can drop it on the ground. Due to the fact that leaving
items lying around is messy and causes a lot of game overhead, we suggest
that you drop, bury, hide or sell objects that you do not wish to keep.

If you feel like getting rid of all the items you are currently
carrying, you may use the command "drop all."

NOTE: Items left on the ground will not be there after reboots.

#
"DROW ELF" (General Information)
===========================================================================
Living far beneath the surface, deep within the bowels of the Underdark,
drow elves are a swift-moving, crafty, remorselessly wicked people ruled by
a society of priestesses who serve the demonic Spider Queen, Lloth. The
drow are an extremely intelligent race, and their abilities and ambition
are feared and loathed by races throughout the Realms, particularly grey
elves, their distant cousins and blood enemies.

Because of the length of time they spend below the surface, drow are hurt
by the natural light of the sun and the light of fire. To compensate, they
have permanent ultravision, allowing them to see in total darkness.
However, they seldom travel to the surface, and never during the daytime.
Drow tend to be weaker and frailer than humans, but are better in most
other areas. Drow are somewhat resistant to magical attacks.

Class list:       Warrior, Cleric, Sorcerer, Conjurer, Necromancer, Thief,
                  Assassin, Bard, Reaver.
Innate abilities: levitate, faerie fire, ultravision, fireball, globe
                  of darkness, mass dispel.

Warning: As one of the eight evil races on Duris, the drow are extremely
difficult to play and face many hardships. Their hometown has been
specifically designed to make life hell and death waits around every
corner. Drow will most certainly encounter situations that would be deemed
"unfair" to any of the surface races. We did this to create a new challenge
for those advanced players who have "beaten" the challenge of life on the
surface world and are looking for something more difficult. You should NOT
play a drow unless you are a *very* advanced player and are used to the
Duris style of MUDding, or are willing to face the hardships without
complaint, as it will NOT be easy.

#
DRUID (Sub-Class of: Priest)
===========================================================================
Druids are powerful priestly types that concentrate their discipline toward
the betterment of nature and world preservation. They generally worship 
deities of the forest and of nature and will dispatch anyone attempting to 
desecrate or destroy a forest. Although their spell-like powers are 
primarily defensive in nature, they do command some very potent offensive 
magic once they attain the higher circles.

Druids have shunned the pantheon of gods and allied themselves with the 
natural world instead. They must 'commune' with their surroundings to 
derive the natural essence that is necessary for their spells. This essence
is most abundant in the untamed wilds.

The Druid class does not pray for spells like other "priests", instead,
their spell slots refill automatically as long as they are not fighting,
casting, unconscious, etc. It is unnecessary to designate a specific array
of spells to memorize (see below). To offset this, the rate of spell 
recovery depends on the availability of natural essence in the Druid's 
surroundings. This essence is readily available in forests, but becomes 
more scarce on other types of terrain, especially indoors. Furthermore,
the essence is automatically channeled into the lowest circle that is not 
completely full before it is channeled into higher circles, so it is 
impossible to prioritize what spells to regain first. Overall, Druids have 
slower, more constant spell recovery.

Allowable races:        Human, Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Centaur

Innate abilities:       Shapechange, Charm Animal, Plane Shift

Equipment Usage:        Druids fall under the Priest classification of
                        item restriction. This means they are generally 
                        restricted to the use of non-edged weapons. Some 
                        exceptions are made depending on which deity the 
                        druid worships. They can wear almost all types of 
                        armor, and are only mildly restricted in usage of 
                        certain miscellaneous magical items.

#
"DUAL WIELD" (Skill)
===========================================================================
"Dual Wield" allows you to wield a primary AND secondary weapon and to use
both to hit your opponent during combat. This, in effect, gives you an  
extra attack per round. The success of the attack depends on your
proficiency in that particular area.

Note: While it is possible for other classes to wield two weapons at once,
they cannot practice this skill and the chances of their hitting an opponent
with a secondary weapon is very unlikely.
===========================================================================

#
"DUERGAR DWARF"
===========================================================================
The duergar are an evil race of gray dwarves that live deep under the
surface of the world, within the depths of the Underdark.  Extremely
cunning and wicked creatures, duergar are known for their deceit and
evil ways.  They hate all other races, except for the drow, with whom
they have grudging trade relations.  They are mortal enemies of the
mountain dwarves.

Duergar are inordinately sturdy and strong, and have permanent
ultravision.  Like the drow, duergar are hurt by natural daylight and
fire, and therefore travel to the surface rarely.

Duergar class list:  Warrior, Cleric, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary.

Duergar stats:  Duergar are stronger and hardier than humans, and somewhat
                more dexterous, but tend to be less intelligent and agile.

Duergar innate abilities:  invisibility, strength, ultravision, UD-sneak,
			   enlarge, hide

&+RWarning:&n  As one of the eight evil races on Duris, the duergar
are extremely difficult to play and face many hardships.  Their
hometown has been specifically designed to make life hell, and death
waits around every corner.  Duergar will most certainly encounter
situations that would be deemed "unfair" to any of the surface races.

EMOTE
===========================================================================
Syntax:  emote <message_text>
         : <message_text>

The "emote" command allows you to creatively pretend that your
character is doing something that the available socials do not
currently allow.  For example, if Fizzwig wished everyone to think he
is a really nice guy, he might type:

        emote hands you 10000 pcoins.
                -or-
        : hands you 10000 pcoins.

This would be viewed as everyone in the room as:

        Fizzwig hands you 10000 pcoins.

Of course, Fizzwig has not really given anyone the coins, he just
wants everyone to think he has.

A quicker, equivalent command is ":"

Note:  "emote" is a social action that is used for *fun*.  Please do not
take these actions seriously.

Offensive spells or any spells that are of the "self only" cast type cannot
be enchanted into the item. Only one enchant affect can be held on a piece
of equipment at any one time and the effect will wear off in the
appropriate time span. Enchanting an item can be an expensive exercise and
you will need to carry the necessary funds to use this skill. An enchanted
item will display a flag indicating that status if successful, however, 
beware that unsuccessful enchant attempts may actually damage the item in 
the process. Example Syntax: enchant cloak 'vitality'

can sometimes even steal it. Their bodies are composed mostly of ethereal

prone to magical attacks. When walking they leave a trail of frost, 
allowing them to tread where others cannot go.

Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.

Equipment usage:        Harpies fall under the Priest classification
                        of item restriction.  This means they are
                        restricted to use of non-edged weapons such as
                        maces, clubs and staves. They can wear almost 
                        any type of armor, but are mildly restricted

EXCHANGE BANKS BALANCE DEPOSIT WITHDRAW
===========================================================================
Banks can be found throughout the Realms, and it is the wise adventurer 
indeed that utilizes them often. Carrying large amounts of money around
with you can be hazardous: you could not only lose the cash you are
carrying if you die, but you would also be welcome prey to any thief.

You can also "exchange" the money that you are carrying for that of smaller
or higher denominations, usually for some surcharge. See below for correct
syntax.

The following commands can be used at any banks:

        BALANCE
        DEPOSIT <amount> <coin_type>
        WITHDRAW <amount> <coin_type>
        EXCHANGE <amount> <coin_type> <desired_coin_type>

Examples of monetary exchange:

        exchange 1000 gcoins pcoins
        exchange 1000 copper platinum
        exchange 5 platinum scoin
        
The standard Duris currency values equate as:

        10 copper =1 silver
        10 silver =1 gold
        10 gold =1 platinum
        
        Be aware that many banks will have a higher exchange rate as they
        like to charge an processing fee!

	  you get experience points. 
	-Healing a person who is in combat and grouped with you will 
	  give you a lot of experience points.
   	-You get exp for each spell you cast upon a monster or a player
	  in your group if you are in combat. The amount of experience
 	  points received depends on which circle the spells is in. You
	  also receive experience points for using skills in combat, such
	  as bash, backstab, kick and so on.
	-If you kill a monster of a higher level than yourself, you get 
 	  bonus experience points.

competitive nature, occasional "flaming" is to be expected, though rampant 
flaming is discouraged and in some cases moderated.

FLANK (Skill)
===========================================================================
The eyeless Dreadlords have senses eerily attuned to other than what can be
seen. This gives them the ability to circle around opponents in the heat of
battle, flanking them and attacking from unexpected positions, making it
harder to dodge and parry their vicious attacks and allowing them to cause
even more damage.

FLEE (Command)
===========================================================================
Syntax:         flee

If, for instance, the minor daemon you so carefully considered turns out to 
be a little more than you bargained for, you can attempt to escape by using 
the "Flee" command. This command, if successful, will allow you to leave 
the room via the nearest exit, if there is one. However, some monsters will 
hunt you down in various manners to try and continue the fight, so be 
warned.

Fleeing is not an effortless action. Extracting yourself from a life or 
death struggle takes energy, so you will eat up your personal stamina in 
such attempts. You will lose a significant amount of moves on a flee.

FORAGE (General Information)
===========================================================================
Syntax: forage

"Ingredients" are located throughout the world of Duris, buried under the
ground. In order to retrieve these ingredients, you must "Forage" for them.
Some classes, such as Alchemists and Forest Druids (specialized Druids),
need specific ingredients in order to cast spells or mix potions.

&+RWarning:&n While foraging, you cannot enter new commands for a period of 
        time, making you prone to attack. So, be sure you are relatively 
        safe before foraging!

===========================================================================
A Forrestal is a multi-class Ranger/Druid.

Notes on Forrestal:
Rangers use spellbooks, and memorize spells.
Druids commune, which is heavilly based on terrain, for both spells
and commune times.
If you start as a Druid, you will commune all your spells.
If you start as a Ranger, you will memorize all your spells, and you
will need spellbooks for BOTH your druid and your ranger spells.

#
FORGE FORGING
===========================================================================
Forging is one of the primary skills of the Alchemist Class. By collecting
material pieces	from the corpses of dead mobs an alchemist can forge a wide 
range of weapons that can be used or sold at shops. 

Forging is much like Crafting in that the more items you have the bigger
weapons you can make, and works in much the same way, except that you do
not specify the "material".

Select only the materials you want to use, place them into your inventory
and type:

     forge weapon-type
     
For example, if you have two of "a cracked magical steel piece" in your
inventory and type "forge dagger" you may end up with a dagger called "a
crude steel dagger". 

Identifying the item after it is created will show you the stats. The
quality of the material used, your skill in forging and your current level
all play a part in how powerful your newly forged weapons become. We are
not giving out material formulas as it is a closely guarded alchemist
secret and nobody wants a guild of alchemists on their back.

FORMATIONS (General Information)
===========================================================================
Syntax: <group formation>
	<group formation _choice_>

When a group is formed the members of it can decide to use formations to 
enhance the offensive and defensive powers of the group. For every group 
size there is at least one type of group formation. To see which formations 
are available to the group type <group formation>. This will list the 
formations and also display how many people are needed to form it and also 
which stances the group members have to be in for the formation to work. 
If a formation is chosen and the party members are not in the right 
stances they will not be able to follow. The only exception to this rule 
is if the stance is <none>.

FRAGS (General Information)

            frag <classname>
            frag <racename>
            frag <racewarsidename>

The term "frag", originally taken from the Vietnam War, is when you kill 
another player. Every time you kill someone who is an opposite racewar side,
(a Human killing a Drow, etc), you get a frag. Every time you are killed by 
someone who is an opposite racewar side, (a Phantom being killed by a 
Drow), you lose a frag. All frags are split between the group equally. So,
if you are with a group of five people and you kill one player, you will
each receive .20 frags. For each player killed, there is a total of 1.00
frags to be split among the grouped victors. Typing "fraglist"  will show
a list of the top ten and lowest ten fraggers in the mud. Or, you may type
"frag <racewarside>", "frag <classname>" or "<frag racename>".

GAZE (Skill)
===========================================================================
The gaping empty sockets of the Dreadlord may be sightless, but its gaze
contains something much more searching, disturbing and terrifying than most
mortals may bear. To have the gaze of a Dreadlord upon you is to know true
fear. Too petrified to move, your world ceasing and stopping as you
struggle to free and turn away. The ability to gaze is dependant on the 
attribute power of the attacker. It is not crucial but will help subdue 
the victim.

GET TAKE (Command)

If you are in a hurry, or if you feel greedy, you can type get all. You can 
also use "get" and "take" to extract objects from containers.

Example:  "get dagger from bag" or more simply, "get dagger bag".

When there is more than one object of the same name in the container or room 
and you wish to get a particular one, use the following example as a 
guideline:

You are in a room and you see:

        A shiny box is lying in the dirt here.
        A shiny box is lying in the dirt here.

If you wished to get the second box, you would type:

        "get 2.box"

GITHYANKI
===========================================================================
Coming from the Astral plane, this race of evil humanoids were slaves of
the Illtihid race millennia ago. The Githyanki broke away from their former 
masters after learning many of their mental powers, and learning how to be 
pure evil.

Githyanki HATE their former masters more then anything and will instantly
attack them on site! Giths will go out of their way to hunt down and
kill any illithid they can find. Githyanki do not have a normal hometown
but must start on the astral plane, in a fortress of Githyanki there. As
newly adult Giths they must now venture to the prime plane and make a
name for themselves.

Githyanki look much like humans only slightly taller, much more thin, with
faces that resemble a decomposing corpse. They tend to be ruthless and
significantly smarter than humans.

Class list:       Warrior, Anti-Paladin, Sorcerer, Necromancer, Bard,
                  Psionicist, Conjurer.       
Innate abilities: levitate, ultravision, shift_prime, shift_astral

&+RWarning:&n  As one of the eight evil races on Duris, the Githyanki are
extremely difficult to play and face many hardships.  Their hometown
has been specifically designed to make life hell and death waits
around every corner.  Githyanki will most certainly encounter situations
that would be deemed "unfair" to any of the surface races.  We did
this to create a new challenge for those advanced players who have
"beaten" the challenge of life on the surface world and are looking
for something more difficult.  You should NOT play a Githyanki unless you
are a *very* advanced player and are used to the Duris style of
MUDding, or are willing to face the hardships without complaint, as it
will NOT be easy.

Money, in the form of various types of coinage, is a little more
difficult to give away.

Syntax:  give <amount> <coin_type> <target>

While in battle, it is often advantageous to check the health condition of
your comrades or the mob that you are fighting. Instead of using the "look"
command, which will list all the equipment the player or mob is wearing,
use the "glance" command. This command will provide you with a synopsis of
the current health of the mob or player that you are glancing at. Others

you just type 'gmotd' or you are not a leader, it will show your current
guild motd.

#
GNOME
===========================================================================
Gnomes are small, sturdy humanoids who are well known for their quick hands
and good humor. Smaller and weaker than humans, gnomes have more wit to
compensate. Gnomes have colonies of their own, but are commonplace among
the major surface communities. Gnomes and dwarves are distantly related,
and gnomes often understand dwarves fairly well. Gnomes have permanent
infravision.

Classes:    Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Sorcerer, Conjurer, Thief, Alchemist,
            Illusionist.
Statistics: Gnomes have very quick minds, but seem to lack the wisdom to
            use that intelligence well. Their bodies are also fairly quick,
            which is probably good, because they are also weak, and not
            very appealing.
Innates:    Infravision, Farsee.

GOBLIN
===========================================================================
Goblins are an inhospitable, evil race that prefers to dwell deep within
the depths of the Underdark. They live in a largely tribal society where
the strongest rule over the rest, existing preferably in underground caves
and similar dismal surroundings. Despite their primitive habitat they are a
rather clever and devious people that have mastered many of the same skills
and magics of the sun-loving races. Goblins are avid slavers and routinely
capture others to serve at their bidding, especially gnomes and mountain
dwarves whom they hate more than anything else.

Goblins range in appearance from a dark, dull green to a dull orange or
brick red. It is rumored that Goblins are distantly related to the Kobolds,
but to this day that claim has yet to be proven.

Class list:       Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Sorcerer, Necromancer, Reaver,
                  Conjurer, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary, Bard, Alchemist,
                  Illusionist.
Statistics:       Goblins are a very intelligent people, therefore they
                  have become a feared race of proficient casters. They are
                  also quite nimble, making them naturals at stealing and
                  stealth.
Innate abilities: ultravision, flurry, disappear.

Warning: As one of the evil races on Duris, Goblins are extremely difficult
to play and face many hardships. Their hometown has been specifically
designed to make life hell and death waits around every corner. Goblins
will most certainly encounter situations that would be deemed "unfair" to

For the duration the cleric will gain melee attacks and also receive a

The blessing of the gods will blanket the room with peace causing all 
players and npc characters to disengage from combat. It will also clear all 
the mobs tracking the cleric.

Healer:
Using the god call as a healer will result in a powerful uninterruptible 
heal that can take form in two different ways. If the god call is used
without a target it will heal every person in the group by 200 hitpoints. 
If it is used with a target it will heal that person 600 hitpoints.

On Duris, we encourage you to participate and add to our MUD in some shape
or form. All those who add to it in a significant way will be moved up in
the chain of command. It will not be easy to move up the ladder, though.

Remember, having your god is a privilege, not a right.

If you make a nice zone or add neat features or good code to Duris, you
will be rewarded for your hard work and will move up the ladder. We, the
Forgers of the Realms, wish to encourage everyone to work hard and
contribute to the never-ending growth of our world.

We need your help!

With that said: if you work for us, you WILL be rewarded. On the other
hand, NO ONE will receive a god just because they are friends ith the
bosses or some other such garbage. We do NOT give away free gods or god
levels. Giving these away would undermine the entire principle of
participation and it would be entirely unfair to those who have worked hard
to get where they are. If you don't get the god of your choice, and want to
be higher, more work is probably the answer.

If, however, you feel you have been cheated, you may request an audience
with an Overlord, where you can voice your concerns and have them heard.
This will hopefully resolve any problems.

#
"GOD, AT"
===========================================================================
"At" lets you perform a command as though you were in a different location.

Examples:
        at fizzwig shout touch me
        at 1201 lick trout
        at lamp look
===========================================================================

#
"GOD, CHEATING"
===========================================================================
This is a sensitive issue on any MUD. Cheating degrades the environment and
can do considerable damage to a MUD's reputation when it occurs.

Thus, on Duris, we have developed a very strict policy toward cheating, and
you MUST understand it. This policy is simple and to the point:

     If you are caught cheating with your god, you will be deleted
     from the MUD. You will lose all of your god powers and there
     will be no questions asked and no second chances.

There are no exceptions. This rulings stands for Forgers as well as all
other gods. Cheating is NOT tolerated here. We have adopted this strict
policy in order to discourage people from cheating in the first place. Just
don't do it, it's not worth the consequences if you are caught.

And, as a reminder, Duris has VERY detailed logs. Almost everything you d 
as a god is logged: loading objects, dropping things, moving about, almost
everything.

We are not trying to be policemen here, nor Big Brother. Always watching
over your shoulder waiting for you to make the wrong move. Trust is a major
factor that affects all of us gods, and without it, we would never gain any
major accomplishments. The Forgers almost never look at the logs, but they
do, occasionally, when they are bored or receive a complaint. Don't be
nervous about having your actions recorded; just don't cheat. If, by
chance, someone witnesses you cheating (as is most often the case), you are
history, period.

If you have even the remotest doubt as to whether your actions would
constitute cheating, DON'T DO IT. Put the situation on hold and consult
with a higher level god.

Thus, the policy is set. You have read it and are expected to abide by it.

&+mExcessive forcing is frowned upon.&n
===========================================================================

#
"GOD, FREEZE"
===========================================================================
&+mSyntax:  freeze <victim>&n

&+mThe mud will accept no commands from the victim until you freeze them&n
&+magain, toggling it off. This is a very effective command, and should be&n
&+mused sparingly.&n
===========================================================================

#
"GOD, GOTO"
===========================================================================
&+m"Goto" lets you change your location to the target's location.&n

&+mExamples: goto 1201         -takes you to room 1201&n
&+m          goto poofbrain    -takes you to Poofbrain&n
&+m          goto lamp         -takes you to the top lamp in the database&n
===========================================================================

#
"GOD, GRANT" "GOD, REVOKE"
===========================================================================
Syntax:  grant <player> <command>&n

"Grant" lets you grant a player a command normally above their level, until
someone uses "revoke" to remove the ability. Be VERY careful in its usage.
The grantable commands form a limited subset of god commands. You can only
revoke a command that was previously granted.
===========================================================================

#
"GOD, GSHOUT"
===========================================================================
&+mThis command is like "shout," but it rings out across the world.&n

&+mExample: gshout I'm the greatest in the universe.&n

&+m         Bippy shouts from the heavens 'I'm the greatest in the universe.'&n
===========================================================================

#
"GOD, INGAME"
===========================================================================

&+monly 1 room.&n
===========================================================================

#
"GOD, INROOM"
===========================================================================
&+m"Inroom" lets you affect an entire room with a command that normally would&n
&+monly affect one person.&n

&+m<string> should contain 1 occurrence of ONE of the following:&n

&+m    %p -all players in the room&n
&+m    %m -all mobs in the room&n
&+m    %a -both mobs and players in the room&n

&+mExample: inroom teleport %p 19617 (Teleports everyone in the room to room&n
&+m19617).&n
&+mExample: inroom force %m report (Forces all mobs in the room to report).&n
===========================================================================

#
"GOD, KNOWLEDGE"
===========================================================================
&+mMortals on any MUD can often get lost or have problems that are far beyond&n
&+mtheir control. This generally occurs no matter how well-coded a MUD is.&n

&+mThus there WILL be situations where you are the only god around and a&n
&+mproblem will arise. It is your responsibility as a god to know the MUD, its&n
&+mpolicies, and its general workings, so that you might be able to help out&n
&+mwhen something goes wrong. If you encounter a problem that you feel only a&n
&+mhigher god or Forger can handle, refer the problem up the ladder. There is&n
&+mnothing wrong with doing that, nor is it a bad thing to do. Actually, if&n
&+myou are in doubt as to the wisdom of your decision, it is often more&n
&+madvantageous to do this than make an incorrect ruling.&n

&+mHowever, we don't want a bunch of gods running around who know nothing&n
&+mabout the mud, and who can't answer simple questions that a mortal might&n
&+mask. If you don't feel knowledgeable enough about things, try to learn so&n
&+myou will be ready.&n

&+mRemember, you represent our entire MUD when you talk one-on-one with a&n
&+mmortal. You are the god, and your actions will reflect heavily upon us all.&n
&+mOne god who m kes a dumb mistake with a wrong person could spell disaster.&n
&+mBad publicity on the Internet and in the Usenet newsgroups would be very&n
&+mdamaging, not to mention embarrassing.&n

&+mSo, in synopsis, if there is a problem beyond your control, don't blow 'em&n
&+moff. Get help.&n
===========================================================================

#
"GOD, LEVELS"
===========================================================================
&+mSyntax: levels [<class>]&n

&+mThis command gives you a list of each experience level for a given class,&n
&+mor those of your own class with no argument. Do not give this information&n
&+mto mortals, as we are trying to hide numbers from the game.&n

#
"GOD, PARTICIPATION"
===========================================================================
&+mThis refers to the level to participation each god is expected to&n
&+mcontribute to the MUD. In order to obtain and maintain a god of some power&n
&+mhere on Duris, each god is expected to continually contribute in some&n
&+mfashion.&n

&+mThe point the Forgers are trying to make is that it is a *privilege* to be&n
&+ma god here on Duris, not a right. Once you have earned your immortality,&n
&+myou are an example to all others below you, mortal or immortal, and there&n
&+mwill always be others that, given the chance, would gladly take your&n
&+mposition.&n

&+mYou are expected to contribute to the MUD in some fashion and on a regular&n
&+mbasis. Unlike some MUDs, you cannot create one or two zones, earn a god,&n
&+mand ride on fame forever. We do NOT, however, mean that you have to work&n
&+mevery day (or even every month), but *some* type of contribution from every&n
&+mgod is necessary to keep Duris expanding and growing.&n

&+mAll gods will be assessed on a regular basis and assessments will be&n
&+mhandled in this manner:&n
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&+mEach month, during the Forgers' regular meeting, each god (including&n
&+mforgers) will be evaluated for the month based on what they have done or&n
&+mnot done to contribute to the MUD. One month of inactivity is fine, even&n
&+mtwo, if you are busy, but *not* three. If you have a reason, such as school&n
&+mor something that inhibits you, fine. If you are having trouble to the&n
&+mextent that it will drastically affect your MUD contribution, inform the&n
&+mForgers *immediately* and there will be no hassles whatsoever.&n

&+mBear in mind that gods with months of inactivity (without a plausible&n
&+mexcuse) will be demoted to mortal status. There will always be other people&n
&+mwho wish to work for Duris and help us out. Inactive gods can easily be&n
&+mreplaced.&n

&+mThe god slots are limited. Thus, if you wish to keep your god, you will&n
&+mhave to work for it like the rest of us (including Forgers).&n

&+mRemember, it is a privilege to be a god here, not a right.&n
===========================================================================

You reply:
        ptell oinkoink shut the hell up before I term you!

<field> is one of the following (the names may be abbreviated):

Name                    (the call-name of an obj/char -e.g., "giant")
Short                   (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                    (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                   (for players)

you enter a string mode (like a bulletin board), and the game will
prompt you for new lines to the string until you exceed the maximum
length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

===========================================================================

#
GROUP (General Information)
===========================================================================
Syntax:  group <playername> (to add a member to your group)
         group me (to leave a group)
         group (to see who is currently in your group)

As you gain levels, you will find that a "Group" will be needed to progress
further in Duris. In order to form a group, first you must find other 
players to group with. Once you have all gotten together in one place and
are ready to go, a leader must be selected. All players must "Consent" the
leader to be part of the group by typing 'consent <leadername>'. The leader 
can now toggle group membership for each player by typing 
'group <playername>'. In addition, if all potential group members are 
following the group leader, he can type 'group all' to automatically group 
anyone following him who is not already grouped. When a person groups 
others, he is automatically included in the group as the group leader.

For example, Fizzwig and Oinkoink wish to form a group with Manwich.

Manwich toggles group membership by typing:
        group fizzwig
        group oinkoink

If Manwich types 'group fizzwig' after the group has been formed, Fizzwig 
will be kicked out of the group. If a group member, including the group 
leader, types 'group me', they will be removed from the group and the next 
player down the group list will automatically become the leader. Typing 
'group' with no argument will show you a list of people in the group and 
their condition.

Groups are comprised of the group leader and people in front and rear ranks.  
Type 'group <playername> front' to send a group member to the front ranks, 
and type 'group <playername> rear' to send a group member to the rear 
ranks.  Your position in the ranks determines how much damage you inflict 
(and receive) from spells and physical attacks.

Players that form a group still get the FULL amount of experience points 
when they kill a monster. This means there is no reason not to group with
another player if you only look at the experience factor. Everyone gets exp
regardless if they participate in the fight or not. In addition, frags are
divided among grouped players. 

If you find yourself in need of a group, you may implement the "Group
Needed" toggle.

GUILD GUILDS ASSOCIATIONS CLANS (General Information)
===========================================================================
This document is designed to answer any questions regarding the creation
of player guilds on Duris. Under the current guild system players are
responsible for the organization of their own guilds. 
The gods themselves will not be responsible or serve any function in the
running of a guild.

How To Begin A Guild
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) The requirements for forming a guild are as follows :
    -All guild members must be at least 25th level or above. The level
      requirement is simply to ensure that the people in the guild are
      familiar with Duris and how it's run.
    -A guild may have upto, but no more than, 3 shared characters.
      These characters can be accessable by some/all members of the guild,
      but are not directly owned by anybody in the guild.
    -Guilds must also keep a member count of at least 5 members, 
      this 5 does &+RNOT&n include the 3 shared characters.  The guild is
      also limited to a maximum of 35 members in the guild at a time.
    -A one time fee of 1,000 platinum is required to start the guild.
      This not does include a guildhall.

IMPORTANT
    -You may only have one character in a guild, and at most one alt in the
      &+RSAME GUILD&n, at a time.  No exceptions.
    -You as a player can only secede from three different guilds EVER.
      If you leave your third different guild, that's it.
    -If you leave a guild you must wait one real week before joining
      another.
    -You may only kick out one member per mud month at a time.

b) What this allows -Once this happens the guild will be created and the
   person forming the guild will be flagged as a guild 'leader'. This will
   allow him/her to recruit members into the guild and promote/demote them
   accordingly. This is done completely without god interference and
   controlled by the code. Any new members will be automatically be flagged
   and titled as a member of the guild. This also will create a guild bank
   account which is accessible by Leaders and Deputies.
   Once a guild has been started and approved by Duris, the guild members
   of that guild must run their own activities. How many people there are
   of a certain guild rank is entirely up to the players. The gods
   themselves will have no interference with the running of the guild
   themselves. Any new members, once enrolled will automatically be titled
   as a basic member of that guild.

Guild Structure
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guilds have specific ranks within them which give their members to ability
do different things depending on their rank. How this works is as follows :

Leader -A leader can change the names of all the ranks (this allows an
guild of sorcerers to name the leader as "ArchMage" rather than "Leader".
These titles must be realistic in a &+Yfantasy world&n. A leader also has the
ability to flag a player as an enemy to the guild (leaders are the only
ones that can remove this flag as well). The leader can also add on an
'on parole' flag to members.

Deputy -A deputy (or higher) can delete, promote and demote members and
also has access to withdraw money from the guild's bank account.

Officer -An officer (or higher) has the right to fine lower members
(dealing out punishments etc).

Senior member -A senior member (or higher) has the right to enroll new
members.

Normal member -A Normal member just has general abilities, access to any
guildhalls that might be available etc. They can also see what other guild
members are online.

Enemy -The guild leader has the ability to flag a member as a guild enemy
as well. This will cause the guild npc's (if any) to attack the player on
sight and is used for betrayal etc.

Applying for Membership
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to be allowed into a guild the player must first apply himself as
an applicant. You can do this by using the 'Society Apply <member>' command
where <member> is the enrolling member of the guild you wish to join.

Guild Locker
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
All guilds currently have a guild locker.  Go to any bank in a hometown
where you can access your personal locker, and you can access your guild
locker with &+Yenter locker guild&n.  All members share access to this
locker.  This replaces the need for guild chests in guildhalls.

GUILDHALLS (General Information)
===========================================================================
After you start a guild you will most likely want to start saving money to
start building your guild somewhere to hang out and organize your next
adventuring trip. For this purpose you can build your guild a guildhall.
The cost involved in building your guildhall are as follows:

        Golem (Sorc, Cleric, Warrior)            10,000 platinum
        Shopkeeper &+RDISABLED&n                      10,000 platinum
        Inn &+RDISABLED&n                             5,000 platinum
        Fountain                                 500 platinum
        Holy/Unholy Fountain                     3,000 platinum
        Magic Mouth &+RDISABLED&n                     500 platinum
        Healing Room                             3,000 platinum
        Chest &+RDISABLED&n                           5,000 platinum
        Guildhall Rooms                          1,000 platinum
        Portals                                  20,000 platinum

"HALF ELF" HALF-ELF (General Information)
===========================================================================
Half-elves are shunned by humans on this world, and, because of this, are
limited in the classes in which they may train. They do have, however, the
option of starting in one of several cities. Half-elves have infravision
and live much longer than humans, although not as long as their full-
blooded grey elf kin.

Classes:    Warrior, Conjurer, Sorcerer, Ranger, Druid, Bard, Assassin,
            Cleric, Paladin, Necromancer, Thief.

            but also tend to be slightly quicker and smarter. Also better
            looking.
Innates:    Infravision.

overlooked.

HARPY GARGOYLE (General Information)
===========================================================================
Harpies are a race of bird people that come from the jungle climates of 
Khomani-Khan. A matriarchal system governs their towns, where the females 
are usually more powerful and dangerous. They are usually frail in physical 
form, but quite adept at the mystical arts. Harpies are slender and 
humanoid, with large wings. The most vital fact of the Harpy species is 
their alliance with no single race, as they are borne into the world 
neutral. They must complete a quest to choose their destiny in the world of 
Duris. Indeed, the harpy culture breeds those who follow the path of 
darkness, light, and even undeath.

Class list:       Sorcerer, Conjurer, Ethermancer, Bard
Statistics:       Harpies are an aerial race that tend to be quick and
                  hearty, yet not very strong. They are much more suited to
                  magic than any combat classes. They regain their spell
                  slots via 'tupor', a calming-state. Due to their bird-
                  like nature, Harpies are constantly flying and have the 
                  ability to 'flutter' to avoid attack and their keen eyes 
                  can see farther than other races. Harpies cannot wear 
                  equipment on their feet or legs, yet they may wear horns.
Innate abilities: fly, perception, dayvision, ultravision
Strength:         Harpies are extremely agile and dexterous creatures with
                  hearty constitutions.
Weakness:         Harpies are usually considerably more frail than an
                  average human, though slightly stronger than elvenkind.
                  Due to their communion with the forces of wind and cold,
                  Harpies must be at least resting or even asleep in order
                  to tupor, thereby making them extremely prone to attack.

passing millennia deep hatred has grown into the hearts of all dwarves 
and they will battle this evil anywhere and everywhere. A result of this

himself. Imbued with the power of pure hellborne fire, the antipaladin not

HIDE (Skill)
===========================================================================

Hide -Rogue Class Skill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:         hide

"Hide" allows you to cleverly conceal yourself from the occupants of a room, 
regardless of whether they are other players or creatures. As with the 
"Sneak" command, there is always a chance that you will not hide 
successfully and your failure to do so will not be obvious to you. If your
attempt to hide is successful, you can only be detected by "Sense Life", 
"Infravision" or "Faerie Fog" . To break the hiding, issue any command. The 
effect will wear off after a period of time.

Hide -General Command
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:         hide <object>

Hide is a command you can use to conceal an object within the room. The
object you are trying to hide must be dropped and on the floor of the room
before you can conceal it. When you "look", this item should no longer 
appear in the room. You may "search" the room to re-discover the hidden 
item.

wield" or "double attack."  Using "hitall", will cause you to be stunned for

attempted to hit.

"IMPRISONMENT" (Spell)
===========================================================================
Area of effect: <victim>
Aggressive:     Yes
Cumulative:     N/A
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster 
Type of spell:  Fear

This powerful spell creates an illusionary wall around the victim. While 
the victim is encased in this wall he or she cannot attack anyone nor can 
any physical or magical damage befall them. The only way a victim can free 
themselves is by trying to move about or by someone trying to attack 
them while imprisoned. If the victim issues no commands and nobody tries
to attack them they will be imprisoned for a very long time. It is 
important to note that due to the difficult nature of this spell it requires 
that both the caster and victim not be physically engaged in combat. 

HINT for Victims: If you are caught in this spell your best bet is to just 
spam any direction until you are free, other commands work as well so you 
can experiment if you like. Once you start trying to break free you will be 
out in 2 to 4 rounds of combat in many cases.

HINT for Illusionists: If your having a hard time getting a victim out of 
combat so you can cast this spell try using your Stunning Visions spell, 
if your lucky it will hit and you should have time to imprison your 
victim before they engage anyone in combat.

#
JUSTICE
===========================================================================
Justice in hometowns when dealing with PKill/PSteal
DEFINITIONS:

PKill:  Player killing.  (as opposed to mob killing)

PSteal: Player stealing.  Stealing from, or attempting to steal from
        another player.
"Aggro action":  For the purposes in this message, an 'aggro action'
                 is any form of physical or magical attack against
                 another player (attempted PKill), OR PSteal.

Outcast: Being outcast from a hometown means that if you set foot in
         that hometown, there is the danger of a specialized group of
         guards coming to kill you.

&+RNOTE&n: ALL OTHER RACES EXCEPT ELF AND HALF-ELF ARE CONSIDERED INVADERS
           TO CHARING, AND WILL BE HUNTED DOWN AND KILLED ON SITE!

HOW JUSTICE WORKS:

JUSTICE ONLY APPLIES IN GOOD ALIGNED HOMETOWNS!

-Any player that witnesses a crime in a hometown can report it to the
  justice.
-If you commit a crime within a hometown and a citizen sees you he/she will
  report it to the justice.
-When a crime is reported to the justice, guards will be sent to arrest the
  criminal (if he/she is still in town).

If a guard arrests you, you will be brought to jail and you will be judged
for your crime during the next justice session.
The sentence you get will depend on the crime you committed.
In each hometown there is a justice hall. The following commands are
available there :

Reporting a crime
  reporting <attacker> <crime> <victim>
Pardoning someone for a crime against you
  pardon <name>
Pay a dept to the town
  pay
List all wanted criminals (see below)
  list
Turn in a wanted criminal
  turn_in <name>

The list of supported crime is :
  Att_theft   (attempted theft)
  Theft       (theft)
  Att_murder  (attempted murder)
  Murder      (murder)

Wanted criminal
  Each hometown has a list of wanted criminals with the reward for bringing
him in. If you catch a wanted criminal and bring him to justice you will get
a reward for it. There is a new command "BIND" that you can use to bring a
live criminal in.

Nothing prevents you from escaping jail, but if you do you will pay the price.

&+RIMPORTANT&N
-Pardoning a person for a crime against you does not prevent this person from
  going to jail but it will be used by the judge when he gives his/her
  sentence.
-You cannot report a murder against yourself. 
-If someone commits a crime against you, you are not allowed to attack him, 
  let justice take care of it.
-A witnessed event is erased after a month, so dont wait too long to report a 
  crime.

KENON (General Information)
===========================================================================
Realizing their mistake with the Kvark language script, the coders modified 
it to produce more coherent English.  Though much easier to understand, the 
Kenon language script is also not without its flaws.  Due to memory
restrictions, the range of Kenons pronouncements is rather limited.  This
often causes Kenon to repeat itself multiple times like a broken record
because it is incapable of storing more than one response at a time.  Upon
reboot Kenon develops a new grammatically correct response it repeats until
its next reboot weeks later.  With the coders growing skills, and the
ability to learn from the past failures of both the Kvark and Kenon
scripts, the next attempt at an intelligent language script should be
successful.

perfectly and generates totally indecipherable bits of gibberish. Often 
Kvark gets into the code, while sometimes providing useful features, most 
often makes the code un-readable and broken.

#
LANGUAGES
===========================================================================
Every race has its own language, and some can also speak a smattering of
other languages. Unless you are proficient in a language, the
communications of someone speaking that language will be incomprehensible
or garbled. You gradually learn another language by being in contact with
those who speak it and listening to it for long enough.

There is currently one language for each race, and a private god language.

LAWS RULES
===========================================================================
Read these carefully and fully ignorance is no excuse.

1.   Player killing is expected to be fully used by all! If someone,
     pisses you off, kill their ass and loot their corpse!

2.   &+RMulti-playing is NOT allowed&N. For clarification of
     multi-playing, &+Ysee "help multi-playing."&N

3.   Bugs are to be reported to gods ASAP. Since we constantly put in 
     new code, there are bound to be bugs. If you aren't sure if 
     something is a bug, ask a god.

4.   Players should settle their own disputes. Talking to a god
     should be a last resort, as gods abide by the non-interference 
     policy. Use the petition channel if you need to consult with a god.

5.   Running robots in ANY shape or form is illegal. This means any robot
     that you set up with clients such as Tintin.

6.   Don't do anything the gods would consider cheesy.                     

                        &+BDURIS BUG POLICY&n

You must report all bugs you as a player find on Duris using the boards,
however once you have reported this bug you &+gMAY NOT&n use it as many
times as you like till the code no longer allows you to.  There is no
exception to this rule. Any bug you find that &+RCRASHES&n or &+RFREEZES&n
the mud must be reported immediately after the next time you login and never
used again.

We the operators of Duris Diku have played many muds over the years and
have always believed that if the code lets you it is for lack of a better term
an undocumented feature of that mud.  We will &+gNOT&n delete players who show
exceptional mudding ability and find these little gems or we might end up
possibly losing the best players on the mud.

Now you may be telling yourself well gee I'll just use a bug over and over
then the first time a god sees me I will tell them I just found it.  Well my
friends &+RTHIS WILL NOT WORK&n because if we see you use a bug once we wont
say anything and will wait for you to either post about it or for you to
use the bug again if it has not already been fixed.

What happens if you use a bug over and over again and don't report it?  As
stated before you will not be deleted however you are subject to penalties
deemed appropriate by the gods at the time, which could be anything from 
a loud chewing out to losing all of your equipment.

If you don't like these rules, too bad, we do and we own the damn machine.

LICH
===========================================================================
A Lich exists because of its own desires and the use of powerful and arcane
magic. The Lich passes from a state of humanity to a non-living existence
through both force of will, and from employing nearly forgotten and
forbidden forms of necromancy. In life, Liches were mostly ultra powerful
necromancers or clerics who, out of an intense fear of death, took
advantage of an unholy opportunity to prolong their lives almost
indefinitely by willingly making the transformation from living to undead.
Although Liches can exist for many eons, eventually its life force will
begin to wane, dooming the Lich to spend eternity roaming strange planes
of existence unknown to even the wisest of sages.

Lich class list:     Necromancer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Conjurer, Alchemist,
                     Dreadlord, Unholy-Piper.

Lich stats:	     A Lich can appear as a skeleton at first glance,
                     but they are covered by a very tight layer of dead
                     and pallid skin.  They are often covered with
                     rotting but fine garments.  Their eye sockets are
                     black holes with glowing points of light in the
                     center.

Lich innate abilities: Ultravision

#
LINK LAG (General Information)
===========================================================================
Many players have problems with their links to the game. This could be very
dangerous to your health in the middle of combat. However, we at Duris feel
it is unfair to place the responsibility for quality of the link on us.
Thus, deaths and injury due to link loss are not our problem.

If your link freezes up for some reason, a god will usually be willing to
release the link, letting you reconnect. If the system that runs the MUD
itself freezes up, your character will not be harmed, as everything and
everyone else in the game will also be frozen. However, if another system
en route to this one lags, you will be put in a dangerous position and your
character could die.

If the network looks shaky, don't put your character in a dangerous
position, as we will NOT reimburse you for losses.

If your WIMPY toggle is enabled, you will automatically flee when your hit
points reach the wimpy level.

#
LOCKER STORAGE (General Information)
===========================================================================
Syntax:         enter locker <name> 
		
Lockers can be found throughout the hometowns of the various races. Lockers 
are personal storage areas where spare equipment that has accumulated can 
be placed. There are various levels of locker access. 

To access your personal locker, type 'enter locker' at any local bank. 

To enter the locker of another person, they must have granted you access. 
You can enter someone else's locker, type 'enter locker char_name'. 

To enter a communal guild locker, you must type 'enter locker guild'. You 
must be a member of the guild to enter! Only one person is allowed in any 
locker, including guild lockers, at any one time. 

The Storage Locker Safety Commission, a group of other-world agents 
summoned by the immortals of this realm, have been called forth to guard 
these magical lockers from unauthorized intrusion. They are responsible 
for the protection of these lockers -any illegal entry or attempts at 
subterfuge will be punished. 

Anything you drop in a locker room will be stored and saved as if you were 
carrying it on your person and rented. This means items that are transient
will crumble and items flagged no rent will disappear. Anyone who is on 
your grant list will be able to access your locker as well. Please see 
"help grant" for information on giving others access to your locker!

To help with sorting and finding eq stored in a locker the command "quit 
sort" can be used. Typing that while in the locker will show a long list 
of options to sort eq by. If the player proceeds to sort eq by one of 
those stats it will place all items that have this stat in another chest 
inside the locker, 2.chest.

Example:
syntax: equip sort wis_max

This will place all items that have the max_wis stat in 2.chest.
===========================================================================

#
LOOK (General Information)
===========================================================================
"Look" is used for studying your surroundings and is more often used in its
short form variation of "l."

Eg : look
     l
     look dragon
     look at board
     look board
     l at board
     look in bag
     l in bag
     l in 2.bag (if you have more than one bag)
     l south
     l candle (if there's an extra description of a candle in a room)

Note that if you type "look at <container>" you will not see its contents.
To see what's inside a container (e.g., a corpse), use the syntax "look IN
<object>." For this type of inspection, it's best to use the command
"examine."

"Look" is also used when utilizing one of Duris's many ships, although with
different syntax.

#
MAGIC (General Information)
===========================================================================
Magic is the broad category of phenomena that goes above and beyond normal
mortal powers. This can range from spells with an immensely wide variety
of effects to the uncanny abilities of a particular type of creature to the
curative powers of a potion to the power of song, and even further, into
areas as yet unexplored. Magic permeates the Realms, binding it together,
but few mortals can claim to possess a working knowledge of the Art, let
alone so-called "mastery."

A list of major topics discussing magic can be found under "help mystics".

#
"MAGIC-USER" "MAGIC USER" MAGE (General Information)
===========================================================================
The term "Magic-User" defines a class of individuals who spend their lives
training in the use of arcane magical spellcraft. They are the ones who
stand at the back of a party during battle and hurl powerful offensive
spells at the enemy. Because they are so powerful in their discipline, they
are typically the most frail in stature.

There are subclasses of Magic-User, each with their own specialties:
Sorcerers, Necromancers and Conjurer classes that are very specific to 
Magic-Users. Being part of the larger class-group, these classes are 
affected by the same class restrictions on equipment and are similar in 
to-hit rolls and average hit points. There are also some other classes that 
only loosely fall within the "Magic-User" definition, these are: 
Psionicists, Illusionists and Alchemists. These sub-classes tend to have similar 
resistances and susceptibilities to things like spells, paralysis, dragon 
breath, etc. Each sub-class rises in level according to its own experience 
chart.

NOTE: Use "help <classname>" for information on each of the sub-classes.

MANA (General Information)

the caster runs out of mana, or exceeds him/herself when casting a spell,
he/she will pass out for a short period of time.

MERCENARY (General Information)
===========================================================================
Privateers who roam the land in a fashion similar to smugglers and thieves,
Mercenaries are a cross between a rogue and a Warrior and have some of the
skills of each. This class is known for its anti-social behavior and they
tend to be extremely selfish by nature. However, everything has its price
and they are soldiers for hire. Mercenaries typically possess more hit 
points than the waspish rogues, but are not quite as brawny as Warriors.
>From long battle experience, they are more likely to hit their opponents
than either Thieves or Assassins.

Allowable races:        Human, Barbarian, Mountain Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, 
                        Duergar Dwarf, Troll, Orc, Goblin, Shadow Beast, 
                        Minotaur, Shade, Revenant, Vampire, Death Knight. 
Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Mercenaries have their
                        own classification of item restriction. They can
                        use quite a variety of weapons but are generally
                        more limited in their selection	of armor. They are
                        moderately limited in their usage of miscellaneous
                        magical items such as wands, etc.

side of the race war they will be on at birth.

                  strength, hearty constitution. Being half bull, they are
                  stronger then any race other then ogres or storm giants.
                  They can see in both day and night with their amazing
                  eyesight, and they can withstand a large amount of 
                  damage. Despite their bad tempers, honor and pride are
                  ALL to a Minotaur.
Weakness:         Minotaurs lose their temper often, being partly bulls,
                  and not quite being able to ignore that aspect of their
                  nature, whenever a Minotuar loses more then 50% of his hit 
                  points, he will become enraged with bloodlust and attack
                  anything in his path, friend and foe alike! Minotaur have
                  VERY large legs, and thus can not wear anything on them,
                  and their hoof-like feet, prevent them from wearing
                  anything on them as well. Also, due to their huge horns
                  they can not wear anything on their heads. They have been
                  known however, to wear things on their horns, and
                  sometimes things in their large noses, or on their tail.

#
"MONK" (Sub-Class of: Fighter)
===========================================================================
Monks are practitioners of ancient martial arts which allows them to be
lethal adversaries without the benefit of cumbersome weaponry. Their hands
and feet are deadly weapons in themselves, and monks are trained to use 
their body in harmony with their minds to destroy their enemies. Monks are 
required to be strong and nimble of body as well as very quick witted to 
successfully practice their art. In addition to being formidable opponents 
in hand-to-hand combat, monks have also mastered the ability to use certain
specialized "chants" in and out of battle. Their chants further enhance the 
monk's abilities in and out of battle.

Allowable races:        Human.
Equipment usage:        Monks fall under a unique set of restrictions for
                        equipment. Since monks rely on using their bodies
                        as their weapons, they cannot afford to have any 
                        part of them weighted down by cumbersome armor or 
                        clothing. Therefore anything worn by monks must
                        weigh 1 pound or less.  However, higher level Monks 
                        can wear slightly heavier garments. Monks usually 
                        favor very light warrior equipment to assist them 
                        in combat.

"MOUNTAIN DWARF" MOUNTAIN DWARF (General Information)
===========================================================================
Preferring to dwell in fortresses built into huge mountain ranges,
mountain dwarves are a mining race known for their fine craftsmanship of
weapons and armor. They are good-natured, sturdy, fearsome warriors who
possess, due to extremely dense muscle and bone structure, high endurance.
Stronger but clumsier than humans, mountain dwarves tend to live to be 
hundreds of years old and often acquire great wisdom with their age. This 
accumulation of intense wisdom frequently induces many of this race to 
become mentors later in life. Mountain dwarves are born with natural 
infravision, which allows them to maneuver quite skillfully in the dark. 
They are well respected among most of the other races, and often trade 
among the general colonies. Mountain dwarves hold a deep abhorrence for the
races of the Underdark, particularly their evil cousins, the gray dwarves, 
more commonly known as duergar.

Class list:       Warrior, Cleric, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary.
Statistics:       Dwarves are stronger and hardier than humans, and
                  somewhat more dexterous, but tend to be less intelligent
                  and agile.

#
"MULTI-CLASS" MULTICLASS (General Information)
===========================================================================
Upon reaching level 50, you may "multi-class" your character, meaning to
add a second class choice to your character. This is not without its drawbacks
however. Also, once you multi-class you CANNOT later change your choice if you
do not like it.

Here are some things to first consider. First you can only multi into classes
that are offered by your race. Some combinations are not available so using 
the command 'multi' on your character will tell you which combinations ARE
available. Multiclasses will get the worst of both classes. All classes have 
dam mod and pulse bonuses/drawbacks. Casters tend to get dam mod penalties. If 
you multi between a hitter and caster the combo would get the casters dam mod, 
pulse and hp. If you multiclass with a class that has fewer slots than other 
casters (such as a bard) the multiclass will the same number of slots as the 
class with the least. A cleric/bard would get bard slots.

The spells/skills of the secondary class are ALL moved up 5 levels. This means  
if a secondary class got a skill at level 51 it will be moved up to 56. This 
means  the multiclass will never be able to gain the 51 skills/spells of the 
secondary class. This because multiclasses will be capped at level 55 or 
lower.

Multiclasses will only be able to wear the eq the prime class can wear. This 
goes for all types of eq, arti as well as normal. Let me repeat that. You 
can ONLY use artifacts that your prime class can use.

The maximum level you can go up to as a multi-class will be 55. Your second
class will always be -5. So at 55 the highest your second class will recognize
is 50. Also, when you multi you lose your specialization you had and go back 
to level 1, with level 1 hitpoints.  Here are the options available to each 
class "IF ALLOWED BY YOUR RACE". Also, for sake of balance, some  
combinations are not allowed (and not on the list of course).

-Cleric: Warrior, Druid, Shaman
-Bard: Sorcerer, Rogue
-Sorcerer: Conjurer
-Warrior: Cleric, Mercenary

MULTI-PLAYING MULTIPLAYING MULTI (General Information)
===========================================================================
Multi-playing, as defined by the gods of Duris, is the playing of more than
one character at a time by any one person, or the sharing of any one
character by two people.

1) You may NOT have more than one character on at ANY time. THIS INCLUDES
   LINK-DEAD CHARACTERS. You MUST rent or camp out your other character
   BEFORE you bring on a new one. The ONLY exception to this is rule #4.

2) You may NOT bring on another character for the purpose of using it to
   act as a "translator" to get around the language barrier.

3) You may NOT bring on another character in order to retrieve 
   equipment, or facilitate the retrieval of equipment for a character
   that has died, REGARDLESS of whether that other character's corpse has
   decomposed or not. This includes, but is not limited to, creating 
   "newbies" to retrieve help retrieve corpses or eq REGARDLESS of who's  
   corpse is being retrieved.  

4) You may NOT have two or more characters online in any way, shape or
   form, UNLESS you are exchanging equipment or using a storage character.
   Multiple characters may only be online inside an inn, and the inn is
   ONLY the one room that you use to rent in and out. Rooms that are
   adjacent to the inn room are NOT acceptable places to have 2 or more
   characters logged in at the same time.

5) You may NOT use a second character to cast spells on another. This rule
   also applies to logging another character on as a "target" for a spell.
   As well, you may not use a second "newbie" character for the purpose
   of creating "newbie equipment" for another character.

6) You may NOT use a second character with the sole purpose being to camp
   near an equipment repop site. Despite the importance of equipment,
   hoarding equipment by this means is deplorable, dishonorable, and 
   ILLEGAL.  It is also illegal to have a character log in the game for 
   the sole purpose of being a target for etherportal, moonwell, relocate, 
   or other methods of long distance travel. This also includes cases 
   where someone else is playing/controlling the "camped 'port target."

7) You may &+rNOT&N bring on a character of an opposite race and use that 
   char to gain information and then pass it along to another of your 
   characters who are on the other side of the race war. Example: Madra is
   a Gnome and has gone with her party of high level good race pc's into
   the underdark on a raid. While there, she gets separated from her party
   and is almost killed by a group of Drow and Duergar, so she goes and
   camps until they leave. She then logs on a newbie Drow and goes to check
   the area she rented at to find out when the group that was after her has
   left. And then she logs on another good race PC and passes on that
   information she got with her newbie Drow to her main party, thus giving
   them information they would NOT have. This goes for high level chars of
   the same race too.

   If Madra happened to have a high level Duergar and only logged on that  
   char to get information as to the location of the people after her other 
   char, she would be considered multi-playing and ALL her chars would be 
   deleted. This goes for evil pc's doing the same thing as the example 
   above.

   &+RYOU MUST WAIT 1 HOUR BEFORE LOGGING IN A CHARACTER ON THE OTHER SIDE&N
   &+ROF THE RACEWARS.&N

   This also goes for people who log on other side chars just to see who 
   is on. Now, we KNOW this rule will be hard to enforce and we WON'T be 
   able to catch everyone who does it. But rest assured, that when we DO 
   catch you, your ass WILL be deleted right there on the spot NO questions 
   asked.

8) You may &+RNOT&n log on another character to take revenge for another of
   your characters that was just killed or assist in anyway in taking
   revenge until at least 1 RL hour has passed. If you do this and get 
   caught you WILL be deleted on the spot. This includes knowingly going
   back to an area where you might reasonably expect to come back into
   the same racewar contact you have just left with the first character.

   Example1: Joe2 is Joe1's secondary. Joe2 is leveling just fine until 
   another PC named Jeff walks into the room and kills Joe2. Shortly after
   Jeff is done looting Joe2, Joe1 logs back on and moonwells himself and a
   big party in to kill Jeff and get Joe2's eq back.   

   Example2: An illithid hears that someone is attacking its primarys'
   guild hall. It worms in, attacks the people trying to get into guild and
   dies many times. So it rents, and after less then 15 mins has passed he
   logs on his primary character to join a group that is defending the
   guildhall.
   
   So play it smart and don't risk it. Most often there IS a high level god 
   on who IS watching, especially if there is a raid going on.

If you require clarification of these rules, &+RASK A GOD&n.

Anyone caught multi-playing will be *severely* dealt with.

As an example ONLY: For a first offense you may lose ONE HALF of your
levels. For a second offense, you will be DELETED. This is ONLY an example;
the actual punishment is up to the god on at the time and is NOT a
debatable issue.

If you have *any* questions on what exactly constitutes multi-playing, post
it or ask the Gods with a petition. Chances are it's a no-no.  These
guidelines, as with all rules, are subject to the interpretation of the Gods!

NECROMANCER (Sub-Class of: Magic-User)
===========================================================================
Necromancers are the branch of magic-users devoted to spells dealing with
the dead and undead. The spells available to a Necromancer are primarily
offensive in nature and are not granted by a deity. In fact, many of a
Necromancer's spells are viewed as evil by the gods. However, the
Necromancer's dark art can transcend the boundary between life and death,
and harness the energies of those on both sides.

Allowable races:        Human, Half-Elf, Drow, Orc, Goblin, Githyanki,
                        Lich, Vampire
Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.
Equipment usage:        Necromancers have their own classification of item
			restriction. They have a small range of weapons
			that they can wield and a smaller range of armor to
			choose from. They can, however, use most magical
			items.

NEWBIE (General Information)
===========================================================================
The term "newbie" is given to a player who is new to the MUD or to MUDding
in general. If you fit this category, we suggest that you spend some time
reading the help files. This will allow you to enter the game and play with
some degree of confidence.

Newbies are encouraged to ask questions of their fellow adventurers often,
to group for protection and to read thoroughly the HELP and INFO files for
information on the MUD.

MUD is an acronym for "multi-user dungeon".  Although there are different
types of MUDs all over the world, Duris runs on modified UBC code and is
loosely based on the Forgotten Realms series of AD&D (Advanced Dungeons and
Dragons) products from TSR, Inc.

NEWBIE TIPS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are new to Duris and the Duris style of MUDding, there are some tips
you can follow that can help you get better oriented and give you more
control over the way you see the world.

First and most importantly, Duris can be a very difficult world, and if you
are not an advanced player it is HIGHLY recommended you play a good raced
character rather than an evil one. Evils face many hardships of various
kinds, and in general evils do not take kindly upon strangers.

Some commands that will help you further: 

&+W1. READ 'HELP COMMANDS'&n. 
This will list all the basic commands you will need to act and interact 
within the MUD. Spend time experimenting with the commands until you feel 
confident using them.

&+W2. TOGGLES&n. 
Typing 'toggle' will give you a list of personal settings you can switch 
on and off for your character. These toggles affect elements such as what 
your character sees, how it communicates, how it behaves in combat and 
much more. Make sure you read 'HELP TOGGLE' for more in-depth info mation 
on individual toggles.

&+W3. DISPLAY&n. 
Typing 'help display' will give you a list of display commands. Experiment 
with these commands until you are familiar with how each one affects what 
you see while playing. After your character first enters the game, we 
strongly recommend typing 'DISPLAY ALL'. This should make things easier on 
you.

If you require any further help, ask your fellow adventurers or check out
the Duris website. Try to group with those near your level to do experience, 
if you are a good raced character you are able to use "nchat" (newbie chat 
channel) to ask questions, or petition a god for help if you're truly lost.

NEW-COMBAT "NEW COMBAT" "GROUP RANKS" RANKS "FRONT RANK" "BACK RANK"
===========================================================================
The biggest, most important change with the new combat stuff is the
new, increased importance of group ranks.  Group ranking is now critical
to the success of PvP engagements.

As before, there are two group ranks ... front and back.  However, the
old effects of group ranking are no longer.

  *)  You must have, at all times, more people in the front rank of your
      group than in the back rank.  The code will enforce this for the
      most part, though there will be times (especially when someone dies
      or leaves the room) when it won't immediately be updated.

  *)  If you are in the rear rank, leave the room, and come back in, as with
      a flee/return combo, you will automatically be ranked to the front.

  *)  Targeted spells can be targeted by anyone on anyone, regardless of
      which group rank the caster and target are in.

  *)  Area spells are still in the game, with a few modifications:
	-Casting time has been increased for all areas
	-Area spells do significantly less damage than before
	-Area spells hit ALL ranks in front of you.  This means if you are
	  grouped to the back rank, you will hit your front rank as well as
	  both enemy ranks.  If you are ranked front, you will hit only the
	  enemy group.

  *)  People in the rear ranks are much harder to target with physical
      attacks. 

The general theory behind this change is to change battles from the current
area spam-fests to battles that require thought and skill to win.  Clearly a
basic group format will have tanks and hitters in the front ranks, with clerics
and other casters in the rear ranks.  However, experimentation with various
group formats will be critical to success.  There will also be no single one
size fits all solution that guarantees a win ... you will have to be flexible
and above all, you have to use your brain, especially with who the primary
targets will be for both casters as well as hitters.

Remember, once you kill one of the front ranked people, one of the rear ranked
guys moves forward (assuming equal numbers in front and back)

I'll leave it up to you folks to see how mob combat will be affected by these
changes.

Expect damages, spell chant times, and just about any other facet of this to
be tweaked as it's used.  Of great use to me will be battle logs that show
problems you may run across.

#
NPC "NON PLAYER CHARACTER" (General Information)
===========================================================================
NPC is short for "non player character" and usually refers to a monster or
mobile in the game that is not controlled by an actual person. These are
the mobs created by zone makers or immortals to fill Duris for purposes
such as experience, equipment, quests, and other things.

#
OGRE (General Information)
===========================================================================
Ogres are a race of massive humanoids that are typically three feet taller
and twice as strong as average humans. Although they are extremely
unintelligent and clumsy, ogres are fearsome warriors and are feared by all
races. Ogres are evil and ill-tempered creatures, and they tend to be
excessively destructive and have been known to occasionally eat humans.
They live amongst themselves in clan-fashion and often organize war parties
to raid and pillage.  

Class list:        Warrior, Shaman.
Stats:             Big as house, strong as ox, ugly as sin, not quick, oh
                   and did I mention some rocks are smarter? Ogre shamans
                   have a rough time.
Innate Abilities:  doorbash, ultravision, bodyslam, bearhug, ogreroar

&+RWarning:&n As one of the eight evil races on Duris, ogres are extremely
difficult to play and face many hardships. Their hometown has been
specifically designed to make life hell, and death waits around every
corner. Ogres will most certainly encounter situations that would be deemed
"unfair" to any of the surface races. We did this to create a new challenge
for those advanced players who have "beaten" the challenge of life on the
surface world, and are looking for something more difficult. You should NOT
play an ogre unless you are a *very* advanced player and are used to the
Duris style of MUDding, or are willing to face the hardships without
complaint, as it is NOT easy.

OGREROAR
===========================================================================

===========================================================================
Syntax (example):
  > open door
or
  > open red (if the door is red and there is more than one to choose from)
or
  > open door south (to open the door in a particular direction)

Similar syntax applies for "close," "lock," and "unlock."

#
ORC
===========================================================================
Orcs are a race of evil humanoids that are, typically, five feet tall with
green or yellowish skin and red eyes. Orcs tend to be more social then most
other evil races, preferring to group with as many of their fellows as
possible. Orcs, while preferring the company of other orcs, are known to
also group with Ogres and Trolls, and even Drow and Duergar from time to
time. Orcs are some of the most deadly creatures to be found on Duris.

Class list:	  Warrior, Anti-Paladin, Cleric, Shaman, Sorcerer, Reaver,
		  Necromancer, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary, Bard, Alchemist,
		  Berserker, Illusionist, Conjurer.
Statistics:       Orcs tend to be weaker then most other races, but make up
                  for that weakness by the sheer force of numbers, and 
                  their unique vision, which allows them to see in both
                  darkness and light, allowing them to be the only race on
                  all of duris to travel both the lands of light and dark.
Innate Abilities: Infravision, Ultravision, Summon Horde.

&+RWarning:&n As one of the eight evil races on Duris, orcs are
extremely difficult to play and face many hardships.  Their hometown
has been specifically designed to make life hell, and death waits
around every corner.  Orcs will most certainly encounter situations
that would be deemed "unfair" to any of the good races.  We did
this to create a new challenge for those advanced players who have
"beaten" the challenge of life on the surface world, and are looking
for something more difficult.  You should NOT play an orc unless you
are a *very* advanced player and are used to the Duris style of
MUDding, or are willing to face the hardships without complaint, as it
is NOT easy.

#
"ORDER FOLLOWERS" (Command)
===========================================================================
Syntax:         order <petname> <command>
                order followers <command>

The "order" command is used in two seperate ways. Classes that have the 
ability to charm mobs must "order" the "pet" to do what the player wants.

Example:        order wolf kill duck

To order multiple followers use the command "order followers"

Example:        order followers kill duck

The second type of "order" command is used by players that have purchased 
a ship. For more information on how the "order" command applies to ships, 
see "help ships."

#
OUTCAST
===========================================================================
Players are outcasted from hometowns for many reasons. If you are an
outcast in a city it means you will not be "well liked" if you go there.
The guards will hunt you down and kill you. Outcasting is permanent and can
NOT be reversed. Some reasons for being outcasted are:

* Race: Some hometowns are not accepting of other races.

For example: ALL RACES except Grey Elves, Half-Elves and Centaurs are
considered invaders to Charing and will be killed on sight.

# 
"OUTDOOR SNEAK" (Innate)

#
PALADIN (Sub-Class of: Fighter)
===========================================================================
Paladins are holy warriors that are dedicated to their gods and to bringing
good to the world. They are hearty fighters that possess limited clerical 
powers granted to them as a reward for their virtue and chivalry. Paladins
are slightly less skilled than pure Warriors and are the best horsemen in 
the world. They have an innate bonus to all saving throws and always detect
evil and good.

Paladins may *not* set "toggle vicious" to on, nor may they set AGGR on, as
this goes against all their training and principles.

Note: Paladins can &+RLOSE&n experience from attacking the wrong things!

As follows:
    Victim is EVIL:     gain full XP as normal.
If Victim is not aggressive to either GOOD alignment or Humans:
    Victim is GOOD:     &+RLOSE&n full XP from kill/attack.
    Victim is NEUTRAL:  &+RLOSE&n 1/3rd XP from kill/attack.
If Victim is aggressive to either GOOD alignment or Humans:
    Victim is GOOD:     gain 1/50th of normal XP.
    Victim is NEUTRAL:  gain 1/5th normal XP.

Allowable races:        Human, Half-Elf
Innate abilities:       Lay Hands, Detect Evil, Detect Good, Summon Mount
Equipment usage:  	Paladins have their own classification of item
			restriction.  They can use almost all weapons
			and most type of armor, but are somewhat limited
			in their use of miscellaneous magical items.

#
"PASS WITHOUT TRACE" (Spell)
===========================================================================
Area of effect: <caster>
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster
Type of spell:  Generic

This spell is rather potent when used outdoors. "Pass Without Trace" 
enables you to efficiently cover your tracks while moving. You will also be 
almost impossible to see from a long distance away.

NOTE: This spell can only be effective when cast on a medium sized or 
      smaller person.
===========================================================================

#
PASSWORD
===========================================================================
The "password" option, seen at the entry menu, allows you to change your
character's password. Players should make it a rule to change their 
passwords often to avoid the unpleasantness of having someone else gain 
control of their character. It is the players' responsibility to safeguard 
themselves by ensuring that they use a different password on each MUD they 
log into. Gods are *not* responsible for any "hacked" or "stolen" 
characters.

PETS (General Information)
===========================================================================
"Pets" are creatures who will permanently follow you and your orders unless 
you attack them or rent them off. You can aquire them in several different 
ways depending on what type of character you are. Some classes have the
ability to "summon" pets. Others have the ability to "charm" a mob to make
it a pet via an innate ability or a spell. One type of character can raise
the dead to create pets. Finally, some classes are forced to purchase pets 
in pet shops located throughout the world.

NOTE:     Your pet follow orders from you until you attack it, you rent or 
          it dies.
&+RWarning:&n Some pets, when left alone, will instantly attack players
        when they enter a room. So, be careful where you leave your pets!

PETITION (Command)
===========================================================================
Syntax:         petition <text>
      
The "Petition" command allows you to send a message to all of the Gods 
currently on the MUD (if there are any).  Certain guidelines should be
followed when petitioning:

* Players (and Gods) are &+RNOT&N to use petition as their own personal
  chat channel.

* Do &+RNOT&N use petition for reporting ideas, suggestions, or complaints.

* Do &+RNOT&N use petition to inquire if a God is logged on. If the God
  does not appear on the "who" list, assume he/she is not on.

* If you have a problem, please describe it in details right away. 
  Do not force Gods to respond to any form of "anyone there" type spam.

Remember that the Gods abide by a non-interference policy. Petition should
not be used to ask questions about equipment, areas, mobs or general game 
play.

If you have a question or need help with a problem, you can either ask 
another player, post on the Duris forums or petition. To speak privately
with a God, use the "Tell" command. Or, if you discover a bug or typo on
Duris, use the "Bug" or "Typo" command. To submit your ideas, you may
implement the "Idea" command. Lastly, if you feel you just HAVE to whine,
use your guild board (if you have access to one) or use the Duris Forums.

Abuse of the petition channel will only invoke the wrath of the gods. We
expect EVERYONE to abide by this.

instrument. These instruments can invoke magical tunes and songs that act
as spells, aiding a party during their adventures. Pipers are a thief/mage/
warrior hybrid by nature, and possess some of the advantages of all of
those classes. They are true "Jacks of all Trade" which means they have
many skills and spells, but are master of none.  

Allowable races:        Vampire, Lich, Shadow Beast.
Equipment Usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Pipers have their own set
                        of equipment they can use. Pipers can use most
                        weapons, and armor, also many magic items.

parameters and you are in the presence of a teacher it will show your list

PRIEST (General Information)
===========================================================================
Priests are individuals who choose to spread the faith of their deities 
through the use of their god-given spell-like powers. The Priest classes 
are generally charged with the vast responsibility of keeping their party
alive with their healing and defensive spells. They are also competent
fighters and can hold their own should battle come their way.

There are subclasses of Priest, each with their own specialties:
clerics, warlocks, druids, shamans and ethermancers. Clerics are the 
closest to the common image of a priest: they spread gospel and pray to 
their deities. Warlocks are Undeads that are very similar to clerics, but 
have a larger repertoire of utilitarian spells. Druids are calmer folk, who 
espouse the virtues of closeness and harmony with nature. Though, they can 
be fearsome when angered. Shamans are a primitive mixture of Priest and 
Magic-User, with some of the abilities of each, but lacking the full powers 
of either. Ethermancers use elemental magic and worship the pagan god of 
storms. The common Priest grouping means the sub-classes are affected by 
the same class-wide restrictions on equipment and are similar in to-hit 
rolls and average hit points. Each sub-class has its own experience chart 
according to which they gain levels.

NOTE: Use "help <classname>" for information on each of the sub-classes.

QUEST
===========================================================================
General Information.

Currently quests exist on Duris in several different forms.  The first
includes quests that are built into the game.  They may be quests for
information, reward, items, spells, and other various things.  Such
quests have quest mobs in the game.  These are monster who have
information concerning the quest.  In order to obtain the information you
must ask or tell the monster some key word which will trigger a
response.  That response may be followed by more key words, etc.  A
monster or mob may require a specific item which he will reward you for
with information, rewards, or a spell.  The gods on Duris will NOT
reveal information about these mobs.  It is up to you to find them.
The second form of quest is run by the gods themselves.  It is usually a
story that they will tell and groups must be formed to solve it.  The
quests are for FUN.  The sole idea behind doing a quest is NOT a reward.
The gods have taken their own time to create something different and
exciting for the mud.  Be grateful.  Because these quests are run by the
gods, they have the power to do what they desire and that may include
changing the form of the quest.

rent (at an Inn only) and camp. If you simply close your client and leave 
your character "link dead", it will remain in the game, which is obviously 
very dangerous, as it will then leave your character defenseless from 
attack.

RACES (General Information)
===========================================================================
Your race is defined by the path you choose to take in the Land of Duris.
Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses and your race should be 
chosen carefully. The following races are currently available on Duris 
DikuMUD:

Human, Barbarian, Drow Elf, Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Duergar
Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Ogre, Minotaur, Goblin, Swamp Troll, Thri-Kreen,
Centaur, Githyanki, Orc, Storm Giant, Vampire, Lich, Wight,
Shadow Beast, Death Knight, Phantom, Shade, Revenant, Harpy

Note: If you are new to Duris, it is recommended that you play a "goodie"
race character, as the other sides are designed much more toward highly
advanced players. The good side races are as follows: Human, Barbarian,
Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Centaur and Storm
Giant or Harpy.

For more information on each race, type "help <racename>."  This will give
you a brief description of each race, its strengths and weaknesses, the
bonus system that applies to it, and its innate abilities, if any. It will
also tell you which classes are available for that race.

For information about the general theme of Duris, with particular attention
to the division between good, evil and undead races, type "help racewars."

RACEWARS PKILL PLAYERKILL (General Information)
===========================================================================
Duris consists of a delicately balanced  To make these wars possible, 
player-killing (aka pkill) is tolerated and even encouraged, subject to 
rules described below.

The good races consist of (Grey Elves, Mountain Dwarves, Gnomes, Halflings, 
Centaurs, Barbarians, Half-Elves and Humans). Undead races include 
(Vampires, Liches, Wights, Shadow Beasts, Death Knights, Phantoms, 
Revenants and Shades). Evil races are (Drow Elves, Duergar Dwarves, Swamp 
Trolls, Ogres, Orcs, Goblins and Githyankis). Alltogether, there are three 
neutral races in the Land of Duris, (Minotaurs, Thri-Kreens and Harpies). 
Minotaurs and Thri-Kreens may choose either the good or e il side of the
racewar when rolling a character. But, Harpies all enter the world as a
neutral race until they complete a quest to seal their fate in Duris.

These sides are at constant war with one another, in an attempt to take
over all of Duris. Each race will have its own home city and the city's
inhabitants are aggressive to the races of the other side. For example, if 
you are a Grey Elf and try to enter Archdrathos (the city of the Drow
Elves) you will be attacked on sight by the drow mobs, guardians of the 
city and possibly drow players. The same holds true for ALL cities of the 
realms.  

Outside of those cities, however, is a dangerous place. You never know who 
or what will be waiting for you on the other side of the city walls.  You
will quickly find that traveling in groups is the best way to survive. As 
to who can attack who, anyone CAN attack anyone.

Evil and Undead races will have a much harder time on Duris than the Good 
races do. Most are blind on the surface world during the day, suffering
from the pureness of daylight. Furthermore, life will be cruel and harsh on 
them. It will be substantially more difficult for ANYONE of an evil or 
undead race to make it to a high level, let alone reach the surface and 
kill anyone. As you can see, there will be plenty of ordeals for these 
races to overcome before they will have the chance to prey on others.
In addition, ANY evil-raced person on the surface will be hunted down by 
powerful good-raced PC's and killed on sight.

This is a VERY brief description of how race wars work on Duris.  The 
more intricate details will be revealed as they unfold.

RAID (General Information)
===========================================================================
If you are trying to retrieve your corpse/EQ after dying in PvP combat you
CANNOT return unless you are fully re-equipped as outlined below.

If are trying to retrieve your corpse/EQ regardless of how you died and
encounter members of the opposite race, corpses from the opposite race or
have other information that members of the opposite race is in the zone you 
CANNOT return if you die again unless you are fully re-equipped as outlined 
below.

If you engage in PvP combat, you are &+R*required*&N to be equipped in at 
least a minimal raid kit consisting of 12 items. To see if you are indeed
raidable you can use the command 'raid' and it will return a yes/no
statement. Included in PvP combat is casting spells on either friendly or 
foes while they are pvp'ing, looting corpses and scouting.

&+YPunishment for raiding without the slots required is 1 level per 
&+Ymissing slot plus the loss off all worn and looted. This applies 
&+Yto all raiders. Cheat repeatedly and it will become harsher.

                        &+WPLEASE READ THE REST:&N

      Minor created and newbie start equipment is NOT acceptable, you must
   always wear your best equipment; if your best equipment is in your corpse,
      on the ground or in your imagination then you must use your next best.   

     Scouting and spam-looting with lowbie chars (like level one giths) is
         cheesy, and it pisses off the imms ... don't piss off the imms!

   If you are outside of your GH or Hometown, these rules are in full effect.
  So if an evil wants to exp in Wemics, or do Outcast Tower for EQ, he has to
    be in full raiding gear. If a goodie wants to exp in Smokeveil, the same
    applies as well as any other normal experience/zone/raid situation. The
      ONLY times you may bypass this are if your storage is in a different
      location than your pop spot (i.e. you pop in Ugta, your storage is in
    Tharnadia) or you are zoning to get equipment to become raidable. Using
    these to run around naked constantly, however, will result in our rapid
   termination from existence. Also, store-bought eq is fine ONLY if you have
      nothing better, either on storage or in your guild or house chests.
 
    LAKING your own equipment to prevent others from obtaining the equipment
      when you know you are going to die is cheesy and pisses off the Gods,
    don't piss off the Gods. This also contravenes the fact that you must be
                           wearing full raid slots.

    Thieves are now bound and held totally to the rules addressed above, as
                  well as the guidelines listed in Help Thief.

#
RAGELORD (Specialization)
===========================================================================
As the name implies, Ragelord's have increased their skills when it comes
to the control of their baser instincts to flurry and rage. With the
enhanced ability to channel these skills, they have learnt to automatically
berserk should they become wounded in battles, increasing their chance to
survive the encounter. Due to this intense focus upon themselves and the 
battle, they are able to more easily avoid the more harmful attack affects
of their opponents. They are therefore while still primarily defensive in
nature, able to tune themselves to a more effective offensive captability.

RANDOM "RANDOM EQUIMENT" "RANDOM MOB" "RANDOM ZONE"
===========================================================================
The chaotic nature of Duris manifest's itself in the spontaneous creation
of creatures, areas and equipment in places not generally found.

Random Equipment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These items are forged by the swirl of powers inherent upon that moment of
death, and can occasionally be found on the corpses of defeated creatures.

Random Mobs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tossed through the ether from latent world magic's gone awry, creatures far
from home can be found wandering lost on the lands. Beware approaching 
these bewildered souls, as fear may drive them past all reasoning and
sanity into beings of unrivaled aggression and power.

Random Zones
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Powerful shifts and changes within the earth's crust toss up areas from the
depths. Still half buried, these require a shovel and some hard digging
before they can be accessed and explored to find what treasures and beasts
may lurk hidden and lie within.

#
RANGER (Sub-Class of: Fighter)
===========================================================================
Rangers are Fighters who are trained and skilled at woodland survival and
techniques. They are one with nature and they are the best in the world at
two-weapon combat. Although, Rangers are not quite as generally skilled in 
battle as Warriors are, they have the advantage of possessing limited 
spell-casting abilities. These abilities are granted to them once they 
progress upward in level and become powerful enough to use the magic as a 
reward for their mastery of woodland survival.

Allowable races:  Human, Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Centaur
Innate abilities: Outdoor Sneak
Equipment usage:  Rangers have their own classification of item
                  restriction. They can use almost all weapons and most
                  types of armor. They are somewhat limited in their use of
                  miscellaneous magical items.     

&+RNOTE&n: Rangers must stay good aligned or else they lose their magical
     abilities until they mend their ways.

and have a quiver with ammunition. You must possess the correct type of 
missile for your particular weapon in order to be able to fire. The number 
of missiles fired depend on the weapon. Elves tend to be very good with 
range weapons.

Syntax:    fire <missile> <target> <direction>

&+cThrown weapon (dagger, spear, axe, etc)&N
To throw a weapon you need to wield it and it must be a throwable weapon. 
If you wield two weapons with the same name, you will throw both. The number 
of attacks is almost the same as when you fight hand-to-hand.

#
REAVER (Sub-Class of: Fighter)
===========================================================================
Reavers are a unique mix of both warrior and spell-caster. They have left
behind their sorcerous professions, and have instead turned to the powers
of the old gods, studying their ways and natures. As such, they have
forgotten much of their old spells in preference of their new direction, 
however they still retain some core spells from their forgotten pasts. In
their thirst for further power, they also too have looked at the ways of
warriors to enhance their abilities and have training their bodies and
minds to gain physical battle skills to enhance their offensive capacity.

Allowable races:        Drow, Orc, Goblin.
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Reavers have their own
                        specific item restrictions. They do however have 
                        quite a wide range of equipment options being able
                        to utilize to some extent, both the weaponry and
                        armor of warriors along with the magical garb of
                        a spellcaster.

#
REBOOT CRASH (General Information)
===========================================================================
The term "reboot" refers to when the game is manually shut down for a short
period of time and restarted. Restarting the game causes all monsters,
areas and equipment to be reloaded as if the game had not been touched. If
a reboot occurs while you are logged on, you will reappear after the reboot
in the same location as you were immediately before the reboot. This is
independent of where you last rented.

The term "crash" refers to when the games simply shuts down without warning
due to reasons outside of the gods' control. As in a reboot, all monsters,
areas, and equipment will load after a crash. The main difference between
the two is that you will appear in the game at the last place that you
rented or camped following a crash.

PLAYER CORPSES WILL RE-LOAD FOLLOWING A REBBOT OR CRASH. REIMBURSEMENTS
FOR DYING BEFORE EITHER WILL NOT BE GIVEN. CORPSES WILL DECAY AS NORMAL.

RECITE SCROLLS
===========================================================================
Syntax:  recite <scroll> [<target>]

REVENANT (General Information)
===========================================================================
A revenant is an undead being fueled by its desire to return for revenge 
and seeks to wreak terror on those who have wronged it. Few possess the 
strength of will and dedication of vengeance required to first fuel their 
bodies to reanimate and secondly to survive the compact they must make with 
unholy powers to remain on the prime material plane. Those that do find 
themselves bereft of most of the knowledge or memories from their past 
life, but are incessantly driven to cause havoc and exact revenge upon the 
entity that caused them to remain attached to this world. 

Revenants retain more strength and stamina from their bodies because their 
souls reanimate their former corpses, imbuing them with more hardiness than 
most of their undead counterparts. They also possess innate magical 
attributes as a result of their unholy compact with the dark forces, but 
are not equipped to wield more powerful magical energies as a result of 
retaining their mortal flesh. 

Class list:         Warrior, Mercenary 
Statistics:         A revenant seems to take a zombie-like appearance. 
                    Upon further examination the self-awareness and fury
                    inherent in their nature manifests itself. Revenants
                    possess much of the constitution and strength from
                    their former lives as well as an imbued mystical
                    regeneration and they often find themselves as the
                    elite fighters of the undead armies that plague the
                    material plane. 
Innate abilities:   Ultravision, Regeneration, Bodyslam, Shadow Door

#
SAVE (Command)
===========================================================================
Syntax:         save

The "Save" command allows you to save the current state of your character.
This includes experience points, statistics, money and equipment. If the 
game crashes, it resets your character to the statistics and equipment it 
had the last time you saved. It is a good idea to manually save your 
character often, especially if you have recently leveled, potioned or 
fragged. Your character is autosaved periodically by the MUD itself, but 
this is a timed event and may not pick up your more recent changes.
===========================================================================

#
"SAVING THROW" "SAVING THROWS"
===========================================================================
A saving throw is a measure of your ability to withstand certain forms of
attack. Every player in the game, monsters included, has five different
saving throw values. These values are level-dependent. The five different
values are as follows:

        SPE     Save versus Spells.
        PAR     Save versus Paralyzation.
        BRE     Save versus Breath Weapon.
        FEA     Save versus Petrification/Polymorph.
        ROD     Save versus Rod/Staff/Wand.

Each of the saving throws has a value from 0 to 20.  The higher your saving
throw, the worse off you are. But what do the numbers mean?

Let's say you are in combat with a red dragon and the dragon breathes fire
at you. In this example, let's say your saving throw vs. breath weapon
(BRE) is 10. A random 20-sided die roll is made when the dragon breathes at
you. If the value of the roll is 11 or above, you have successfully saved
vs. the dragon's breath, and take only half damage from it. If the roll is
0-10, you have failed your save and will take full damage from the dragon's
fire. Thus, the lower the saving throw you have, the greater your chances
are for saving against the dragon's breath.

The same system works for spells. If, for example, a player-killer arrives
and tries to cast a "sleep" spell on you, and you fail your save, you will
be affected and fall asleep. If you save successfully, you will be
unaffected.

Normally, saving throws are determined by the experience your character has
achieved and they will get steadily smaller as you go up in level. There
are, however, items in the game that will lower your saving throws
magically.
===========================================================================

#
SAY TELL WHISPER ASK (Command)
===========================================================================
Syntax:         say <text> &+G-or-&n ' <text>
                tell <character> <text>
                whisper <character> <text>
                ask <character> <text>

In order to communicate with other players, you must begin your sentences 
with one of the above commands. Use "Say" if you wish everyone in the room 
to hear you (characters who are asleep are incommunicado, except to gods).  
The single character ' is a shortcut for "Say" and has precisely the same 
syntax. "Tell", "Whisper" and "Ask" are used to keep your conversations
private and must be accompanied by the name of the player with whom you wish 
to converse. "Whisper" and "Ask" can only be used if the player you want to 
converse with is the same room. Whereas, "Tell" is used for global 
communication. You can "Tell" anyone who is awake and has the tell toggle
ON, no matter where they are in the MUD.

Toggling "Tell" will effectively allow you to turn off this line of 
communication. However, it will not prevent a God from speaking to you.

SHAMAN (Sub-Class of: Priest)
===========================================================================
Shamans are unlike most other magic-using classes, in that they use the
powers of nature, the elements and the spirit world to create and use their 
magics. Unlike Druids, however, they twist the forces of nature for their 
own uses instead of communing on a more friendly, integral level. Shamans'
spellcasting abilities include healing and offensive, though neither is as 
far-reaching or potent as those of a Sorcerer or Cleric. Shamans are also 
unique in that they must use totems in order to cast their spells. For more 
help, see TOTEM.

Allowable races:        Ogre, Swamp Troll, Orc, Barbarian, Centaur, Goblin,
                        Gnome, Halfling, Minotaur, Human.
Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.
Equipment usage:        Shamans fall under the Priest classification of 
                        item restriction. This means they are restricted to 
                        use of non-edged weapons such as maces, clubs and 
                        staves. Some exceptions are allowed, depending on 
                        the deity you worship. They can wear almost any 
                        type of armor, but are mildly restricted in the use 
                        of miscellaneous magical items.

SHAPECHANGE SHAPE (Innate)

                To return to normal:         shapechange me

Druids use this innate ability to change their form. Through careful 
research, the Druid is capable of reforming its body into almost any animal.  

To change into an animal, the druid finds a suitable animal, and while
standing alongside it, types "shapechange animal" (replacing animal with 
the name of the animal.)  While in this form, the druid will notice that it
takes considerably longer to commune spells.  As well, if the druid becomes
engaged in battle while shape changed, they may revert into their original
form.

Changing back:
Type "shape me" to change back into your original form.

A dock is much like any other shop, you use "buy #" and "list" to see what 
ships and ship accessories are available at the docks.  You can only buy 
a ship at one of the major docks in the world.  An example is Tharnadia on 
the Goodie Continent.  To buy your first ship, you must also give it a name. 
Names of ship use ANSI commands so you should first use "Testcolor" command 
to perfect the name of your ship, otherwise you could end up with a lousy 
looking shipname.

The syntax for buying your first ship is "buy # <shipname>" where # is 
the number of the hull you wish to purchase, and shipname is the above 
mentioned name you create using ANSI commands. 

Ok, now you've purchased your ship, the "list" menu at all docks will 
have changed.  You can now see 4 sections instead of just one. From now 
on, you will not have to state a shipname when you buy or upgrade your 
hull.  You are PERMANENTLY stuck with that shipname for this character.

SHIP_CREWS
===========================================================================
In Sarmiz'Duul, you will find a pub that has several crews for hire.

Syntax:
hire <number> <sail/gun>

-==Sail Crews==-
Standard Crew        Repair Rating:20      Cost: Free (starting crew)
Veteran Crew         Repair Rating:30      Cost: 2000 platinum
Elite Crew           Repair Rating:40      Cost: 5000 platinum
Repair Crew          Repair Rating:70      Cost: 750 platinum
-==Gun Crews==-
Standard Crew        Stamina:70            Cost: Free (starting crew)
Veteran Archers      Stamina:100           Cost: 2000 platinum
Elite Catapult Crew  Stamina:130           Cost: 5000 platinum
Stamina Crew         Stamina:200           Cost: 750 platinum

Veteran crews (of both types) require 500 ship frags to purchase.
Elite crews require 1000 ship frags to purchase.

It is rumored that an expert machinist has perfected the construction of
Automoton crews, but most believe this to be just a rumor.
Under the &+Yremote&n possibility it &+Ywere&n true, it would require an &+RINSANE&n
number of ship frags for him to even &+Yconsider&n selling you the crews.

Each crew has an experience level that looks like this:  5/10
The lower number is how much exp your crew currently has, and the higher
number is the max exp that crew can achieve.

If your ship frags drops below the amount needed to purchase that crew
you will lose that crew.

At the moment, experience is a reflection of your ship frags:
200 ship frags = 2 experience.
500 ship frags = 5 experience.

#
SHIP_LIST
===========================================================================
This is one of few single commands that will be covered in a helpfile, 
simply because this command holds so much information. When you type 
"list" at a dock, after you have purchased a ship, you see 4 sections: 

-Hull Upgrades 
-Sail 
-Weapons 
-and then a set of sample commands. 


Hull Upgrades
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section tells you all the larger ship classes you can upgrade your 
current ship to. A portion of the cost of your current hull will be 
deducted from the cost of upgrading to a higher hull class. This means, 
if you buy a sloop, and then a clipper, it will be more expensive than 
simply buying a clipper to start with. However, it will not be as costly 
as buying two separate ships (the clipper and the sloop). Again, you will 
not need to restate the name of your ship, when you upgrade your hull. 

Sail
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your ship requires a sail to move (sorry, you cannot move a galleon by 
paddling it with your hands). Sails are free, but depending on the size of 
the sail, it can take a long time to make the sail and put it on the ship. 
If you do not have enough sail, your ship is immobile (your sail isn't very 
effective with big holes in it). Likewise, if your sail is damaged, you 
will move slower and slower until you are also immobile. 

Weapons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weapons are the fun part of sailing. Shooting down other players and 
their ships! Combat will be covered in "Help SHIP_COMBAT." When you buy a
weapon, you must state what part of the ship the weapon should be mounted
on. You should read "Help SHIP_COMBAT" before you buy weapons, so you can
develop your fighting strategy and buy your weapons to match. To buy a
weapon, you type "buy weapon # <location>" where # is the weapon ID number
when you type "list" at the docks, and location is the part of the ship you
wish to place the weapon. 

At the moment, capitol weapons require 2000 ship frags to purchase.

Finally, the commands list at the bottom of the "list" command output a few 
commands on how to operate the buying, selling, repairing, reloading, etc. 
of your ship. There is also a line "Available space on ship:" which tells 
you how much space you have to purchase more cargo, sail, or weapons. The 
higher the ship class, generally means you have more room for each of these 
items. 

Next suggested reading: "help SHIP_MOVEMENT" 

===========================================================================
See also: SHIP_COMBAT, SHIP_COMMANDS, SHIPS

#
SHIP_MOVEMENT
===========================================================================
Once you have purchased your ship and sail, you are ready to sail the seas,
pillage ships, run cargo, and travel the world. 

Dock Movement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you are docked, you cannot unfurl your sails and take off safely. 
You must first maneuver out to the open seas, away from the docks. Some 
docks have complex zones, much like a normal zone, except it's all water. 
You still maneuver in "rooms" dictating N,S,E, or W as the direction. 

The command to maneuver is: "Order Maneuver <direction>" 

World Movement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ship system works on a principle of speed and heading. What this means
is, if you set your ship to a certain speed, it will continue moving until
the speed is set to 0. Heading is the direction that the ship is pointing
and hence will be the direction the ship will be traveling. Heading is
done from a 0-360 degree circle with north being 0, east being 90, south 
being 180, and west being 270. 

Also affecting the ships is acceleration and turn rate. When a speed is 
set, the ship does not immediately jump to that speed, it has to accelerate 
to the set speed. Acceleration is faster on smaller ships with large sails 
than a large ship with small sails. On the same note, when a heading is 
set, the ship does not immediately face that direction, it has to turn to 
indicated direction, this is the turn rate. Turn rate is higher on smaller 
ships than large Dreadnaughts, so theoretically a small fast Clipper can 
run circles around a Galleon. Turn rate is also affected by the speed of 
the ship, the faster a ship is traveling the slower they turn, and below a 
minimum speed, the ship also turns slower so it is best to maintain a 
medium speed for best maneuverability. 

Details
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to re-dock your ship, you must be adjacent to the dock zone, or 
adjacent to an area of land which is dockable [Note-1], and you again use 
the "order maneuver <direction>" command as you use when you are leaving 
the docks. Beware: if you attempt to SAIL into a shore, you have a chance 
of CRASHING into the shore, even if the zone is a dock. Your ship crew 
will try to prevent this, but they cannot be relied upon every time.  You 
must also be traveling at 20 speed or less in order to attempt to maneuver. 

Next suggested reading: "help Ship_Combat" 

NOTE:  Such as shores and coasts. Not all shores and coasts are dockable 
You are expected to find these other locations yourself, however if another
ship is already docked there, this is a good indicator. To test a spot,
simply sail alongside the square, slow to 10 speed or less, and attempt to
maneuver onto the shore. If it works, you found it, if not, DON'T CRASH! :) 
         
===========================================================================

#
SHIP_COMBAT SHIP_BATTLE 
===========================================================================
Combat on the ship system works on the principle of firing arcs, range, 
targets, and damage. 

Firing Arcs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firing arcs are the direction your weapons are pointing on your ship. For 
example, a ballistae mounted on your Port(Left) side is pointing to the 
ship's left, so if the target is on the right side, it is out of that 
particular weapon's arc, so if weapons are mounted only on the forward arc, 
that means the ship only has a limited arc of fire in the front. If a ship 
has weapons on all four parts of the ship it can shoot in any direction. 

Range
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each weapon has a Short, Medium, and Long range to them. What this means 
is that a Large Ballistae which might have a Short range of 4, Medium of 
8, and long of 12 can shoot targets as far as 12 squares away, as the ship 
gets closer to the target and gets within 8 squares, the ship will have a 
better chance of hitting the target, if the target gets within 4 squares, 
it will be an almost sure hit. 

Targets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fighting in ships requires you to lock onto another ship. This uses the 
ID of the ship (covered in "help Ship_Looks"). The syntax is "Lock <ID>" 
When you are locked onto a ship, your crew will try to attack that ship and 
only that ship when you order them to fire weapons. However, you can 
reassign the Lock id at any time, as often and as quickly as you wish. 

Damage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a ship is hit, it is hit on one of the four sides. Each side has 
two types of HP, armor and hull. Armor is made to take damage, as long as 
a ship has armor, its weapons and insides are protected. Once the ship's 
armor is blasted away however, damage goes to the hull of the ship. Hull 
is basically the framework of the ship, hits in the hull can cause critical 
hits where it knocks the crew to the ground or even destroys weapons. Once 
all the hull of a side is gone, the ship is taking on water, not enough to 
sink it, but enough to immobilize it. Once two hull sides are blown away, 
the ship no longer can float and will sink. If the ship is fast enough and 
doesn't want to get blown up, they have the choice of running, but be 
warned, the rear of a ship has about half the armor and has more delicate 
structure than the rest of the ship (Like the Rudder) so the ship will be 
quite vulnerable there. Also when a ship gets hit, it has a chance of 
getting hit in the sails which makes the ship not able to move as fast 
(can't move if your sails have big holes in it), and even possibly, with 
enough hits, the sail can get completely destroyed, making the ship 
immobile, or basically dead in the water -a sitting duck. 

Next suggested reading: "help SHIP_CARGO" 
If you don't like cargo: "help SHIP_LOOKS" 

Note: When a weapon is fired it will take approx 30 seconds to reload. 

Note: As a last resort you can RAM the other ship, which does massive 
damage to both.
Syntax:  Order Ram
You need to be moving fast for this to work.

Note: Many players will disembark their own ship after they immobilize 
yours, and then board yours to kill you AND your destroy your ship 
afterwards. You can also do this yourself (just don't die on THEIR ship).

After Sinking a ship, use the command "Get Money" to collect the prize
money for sinking your enemy.

===========================================================================

#
SHIP_CARGO 
===========================================================================

Space
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cargo takes up 1 unit of space on your ship. Sails take up 3 units of 
space, and each weapon takes up it's specific labeled amount of space. Type 
"list" to see how much space a weapon takes up. For every unit of cargo 
you are hauling, your ACTUAL top speed becomes 2 less than your LISTED top 
speed. This occurs ONLY if your ship is completely full(0 space remaining) 
This means if you are hauling 15 cargo, your actual top speed is 30 less 
than your listed top speed. You can still set your speed above this value, 
but your ship will not actually go that speed. See "Help SHIP_LOOKS" to 
see how to determine your current speed. Bigger ships have more space. 

Buying and Selling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To buy cargo, go to one of the major docks in the world, and dock your 
ship there. Then type "list cargo". This gives you a list of the one type 
of cargo you can BUY at this dock, and the many other types of cargo you 
can SELL here. It also gives you a list of prices, which are vital to 
actually MAKING MONEY, which is the sole purpose of running cargo. Make 
sure you buy low and sell high. First determine how much space you have 
or need to make for cargo. A few methods of cargo running are: 

Minimum cargo, Maximum speed 
     (tune your ship to carry only enough cargo to travel 60-90) 
Half and half 
     (tune your ship to travel about 40-70 when hauling cargo) 
Maximum cargo, Minimum speed 
     (tune your ship to barely any sails or speed, but once you get there, 
      you'll be RICH -this is very hard without weapons -which take up 
      valuable cargo space) 

Finally, to buy cargo, stand on the dock, and type "buy cargo #" where # is 
the number of units of cargo you wish to buy. 

Once you buy the cargo, you sail to a DIFFERENT major dock.  Disembark, and 
type "sell cargo". You should type "list cargo" to ensure you're making a 
profit first. 

Then, repeat, buy, sail somewhere, sell.... 

Next suggested reading: "help SHIP_LOOKS" 

Note: If you summon your ship to another location, all cargo in your ship 
will be lost. Use summon only as a last resort if you run cargo. 

Note: Each major docks has it's own type of cargo. This should never 
change. Therefore, by number of types of cargo available, you can determine
how many major ports there are, and even approximate what continent any
specific type of cargo can be purchased at. Example: Elven Goods are bought
on the Elven Continent. 

Note: A sloop and a Yacht have limited space. Those two ships can have 100%
sail, so you have to buy LESS than the max sail to haul cargo, at 3 sail
taking the same space as 1 cargo. 

Note: Many cargo ships have no weapons. If you are attacked, and you 
Would rather live and escape than sink to the bottom of the ocean, you can
type "order jettison cargo" and your actual top speed will now match your
listed top speed, allowing you to escape.

SHIP_LOOKS 
===========================================================================

Look Out
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This command looks outside your ship, at the immediate surroundings. If 
you are in a dock zone, it will tell you the available exits much like when 
you are walking around normally. This will tell you other ships in your 
square, and it will show you a small portion of the worldmap (in squares) 
when you are outside. 

Look Tactical
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
look tactical (optional parameters are <X> <Y>) 

This will show you a tactical map centered on you (or x,y with 50,50 
being the center of the map -ie YOU). It is displayed as a hex grid and 
any nearby ships will be displayed according to their ID. The Hex grid is 
the square setup basically "converted" to a hex grid, so it is not always 
perfect in appearance. If the optional parameters <X> and <Y> are given the
map will center on that coord if it is within 35 hexes. This is a
calculated value, if you provide numbers outside the range, you will see an
error message. You cannot Look Tactical inside a dock zone. 

Look cargo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will tell you what cargo you currently have on your ship, and the 
price you paid for that cargo. 

Look Status/Look Ship
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will show you a detailed status of your ship with HPs and weapon 
status (whether its reloading or ready to fire) and ammo remaining. It 
will also show your position, speed, heading and target. The ID number on 
the upper right corner of the status display is your current ID if you are 
sailing, or a ** if you are docked. This ID starts at AA for the first 
ship out, and continues for as many ships are currently sailing. It can be 
an indicator of how many other ships are sailing the world, also. 

Look Weaponspec
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will show you the specifications of all your weapons. It will show 
their weapon ranges and damage each shot will do as well as if the weapon
is destroyed or not. 

Look Sight <#>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will show your percent chance to hit with a specific weapon.

Look Sight <weapon number> 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your have a target this command will show you your percentage to hit
the current locked target with that particular weapon. 

Look Contacts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will display a list of all ships within a 35 square radius of your 
ship. This is the heart of getting info on your target. The list is broken 
into several parts and will look kinda like this:

Contact listing 
===============================================
[AN] 'NorgDog'         X:53  Y:50  Z:0   R:3.0   B:90  H:0   S:0 |S 

"AN" is the ship's ID this is the parameter you pass to lock to lock onto 
this target. 

'Norgdog' is the ship's name. 

X:53 and Y:50 are their x, y coords on your tactical map, so if you do a 
'look tactical 53 50', it will center the map on Norgdog. 

R:3.0 is Range, so in this case, Norgdog is 3 Squares from you. 

B:90 is their bearing to you, so in this case, Norgdog is to your east 
since 90 is east, so if you were to head east, you would be facing 
Norgdog. 

H:0 is Norgdog's heading.. so in this case, Norgdog is facing north 
since 0 is North. 

S:0 is Norgdog's speed so in this case, its not moving since it's 0. 

Last bit is the S, which means it is on your starboard firing 
arc, so if you have any weapons on your starboard side, they can fire at 
Norgdog.

SHOPS SHOPKEEPER

Shops are places where players may purchase equipment for their
adventuring needs or sell extra items and treasures.  Many shops trade
only in specific types of merchandise, or may not have enough money to
pay you what your item's true value is.  Thus, a baker or an armorer
may refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality!

To some people, murdering the keeper in the prospect of obtaining the
entire inventory of a shop, or gaining a large amount of experience
points may appear tempting, but beware!  Shopkeepers are often rugged,
capable men and women who are roughened by years of trading and
surviving in a harsh world.  Killing them may not be as easy as it

SMELTING (Skill)
===========================================================================
Smelting is one of the skills known to the Alchemist Class. It allows you
to merge pieces of ore into larger ones. This is helpful in order to fulfil
the requirements needed to forge various items.

A foundry is required to smelt ore, this can be innately created by any
alchemist.

To smelt ore simply follow these steps:
   Create a foundry.
   Open the forge.
   Put the ore you wish to smelt into the forge.
   Smelt the ore.

The syntax for using this skill is &+Ysmelt&n.

Both the skill in smelting and level of the alchemist will determine how
successful the outcome is. It is well known that less experienced
alchemists often end up with nothing but ashes when trying to use
this skill.

#
SNEAK (Skill)
===========================================================================
Syntax:         sneak (for Assassin, Unholy-Piper, Bard)
                sneak off

This allows you to move silently from one place to another. A person who 
sneaks successfully will be able to travel (for a period of time) without 
anyone taking notice of his or her arrival or departure. As with most 
learned skills, there is always a chance that you will not sneak 
successfully and, with this particular command, you will be unable to tell 
if it has worked or not. You can quit sneaking with "sneak off."

SOCIETY
===========================================================================
Association Command

Syntax:   society <s>ubcommands argumentlist

(Subcommands can be accessed by just using the first letter.)


List of subcommands
-------------------

&+Wsociety&n
soc -displays a list of members and various info about them depending
      on your rank. Members higher in rank than you are only shown if online.
      Also displays some info on the association to higher ranks.
      Finally it gives a list of people ostracized by your association.

&+Wsociety apply member&n
soc a Hero -applies to the (senior or higher) member Hero of an association
             for membership in his association.
soc a me -clears an existing application to an association.

&+Wsociety enroll applicant&n
soc e Newone -enrolls Newone to the association, if he has applied for
               membership first.

&+Wsociety kickout member&n
soc k Twink -kicks member Twink out of the association, erasing his name
              in the member list. Is also used to delete names from the
              ostracism list.

&+Wsociety secede [confirm]&n
soc s -just displays a warning message that "soc s confirm" has to be typed
soc s confirm -the member leaves the association. All his data is erased
                from the member list -except if he was a declared enemy.
                Then he is automatically put on the ostracism list.

&+Wsociety ostracize name&n
soc o Anti -puts the name "Anti" on the ostracism list. The association's
             guards will then attack any person with the name "Anti" as
             if they had the rank enemy in the association.

&+Wsociety rank name change&n
soc r Lucky 2 -the member Lucky is promoted by two ranks.
soc r Noluck -3 -the member Noluck is demoted by three ranks.
                   Note that the minimum mortal rank obtainable with this
                   normal (member) and the maximum is leader.

&+Wsociety punish name&n
soc p Arrggh -the first punish puts member Arrggh on parole.
soc p Arrggh -the second one declares Arrggh as enemy, thus making the
               association guards aggressive to him. The rank subcommand
               (see above) can be used to reinstate Arrggh, but only a
               leader can do this once he is of enemy rank.

&+Wsociety challenge member&n
soc c Bigger -(this is not allowed by all association) this challenges a
               member of the next higher rank for his position. This is
               a political command, there is no auto-attack. The outcome
               of the challenge depends mainly on experience and the
               looser faces tough penalties.

&+Wsociety name rank_keyword new_rank_name&n
soc n enemy Hunted by -the new rank name of the enemy rank is "Hunted by".
                        A list of rank_keywords and current names for them
                        is shown to the leader with the "soc" list.
soc n l Master of -the rank keywords can be abbreviated as well, here "l"
                    stands for leader rank, now called "Master of".
soc n normal -without a new rank name, the rank name is wiped and in the
               title only the association name is shown.
               ANSI can be used in rank names. Note that the association name
               is pasted directly behind the rank name, so often a trailing
               space is necessary in the given rank name.

&+Wsociety home&n
soc h -set your hometown and birthplace to your guild hall. You must be 
        inside your hall for it to work.

* The following money commands accept multiple arguments for "money" and
* the coin type is determined by the first letter only. So a valid
* example would be: "10 plat 2 gc 3 s 5 copper".

&+Gsociety fine name money&n
soc f Wrong 20 p 10 sc -issues a fine of 20 platinum and 10 silver coins to
                         member Wrong of the association.
soc f Wrong -30 plat -subtracts 30 plat from the debt Wrong has. If he has
                       less than 30 p debts, then his debt is set to zero.
soc f all 20 gold -issues a fine of 20 gold (for example as membership fee)
                    to everybody. Note that one can fine only lower ranks, so
                    in truth this would give only fines to all lower ranks.

&+Gsociety deposit money&n
soc d 12 platinum 30 cc -deposits 12 plat and 30 copper into the association
                          account. Any debts the member has are lessened
                          accordingly. This subcommand can be used by
                          applicants to pay an entrance fee.

&+Wsociety withdraw money&n
soc w 100 plat -withdraws 100 platinum coins from the association account.

&+Wsociety title name new_title
soc t billybob &+YCorn&+WHusker &+CSupreme&n -sets BillyBob's 'rank'
title to CornHusker Supreme.  this title is never overwritten by new
rank titles as long as the "no title change" toggle is set (see below).
this command can only be used by guild leaders (to title other players),
or deputies and officers (to title themselves).

&+Wsociety toggle_title_flag
soc g -toggles your 'no title change' flag

"SOCIETY EXAMPLES"
===========================================================================

Becoming a founding leader:

1) soc secede -to secede from the association one is joined up in
2) soc apply me -to clear applications to other associations
3) decide on the association name and whether challenge will be allowed
4) talk to association god(s).

Note that 1) and 2) can be skipped if one isn't member/applicant.

Typical enrolment procedure (Aguy is non-member, Bguy is senior member):

Aguy: ' I would like to join.
Bguy: ' Ok, entrance fee is 10 plat.
Bguy: society   *To check how much money the association has now.*
Aguy: society apply Bguy   *Aguy is now applicant to Bguy's association.*
Aguy: society deposit 10 plat   *Aguy pays entrance fee.*
Aguy: ' Ok, I paid up.
Bguy: society   *To check that statement*.
Bguy: society enroll Aguy   *Enroll Aguy to the association as normal member.*

Note that Aguy pays to the association, not to Bguy, to avoid fraud.

Officer Aguy wants to issue a general membership fee of 1 plat, fine Bguy
10 plat and keep Cguy completely free of debt (Cguy has no debt up to now):

Aguy: society fine all 1 p   *Fines only members with lower rank!*
Aguy: society fine Bguy 10 p   *Bguy now has at least a debt of 11 plat.*
Aguy: society fine Cguy -20 p   *Subtracts 20 p from Cguy's debt, wiping it.*

Leader Bigone and Deputy Notsobig disagree on treating Member Twink:

Bigone: society punish Twink   *Puts Twink on parole*
Notsobig: society rank Twink +1   *Twink is normal member again.*
Bigone: tell Notsobig WTF?
Bigone: society punish Twink   *He is on parole again.*
Bigone: society punish Twink   *Now he is enemy, Notsobig can't lift that.*
Bigone: society fine Notsobig 100 plat   *Notsobig is in trouble...*
Notsobig: ' You are going down!   *Notsobig is in same room as Bigone.*
Notsobig: society challenge Bigone   *Say he wins the challenge.*
Notsobig: society kickout Bigone   *Notsobig is the leader now: Bye, bye...*
Notsobig: society rank Twink +5   *He makes Twink Deputy.*
Bigone: ' Hah!
Bigone: kill Notsobig    *Say he wins and Notsobig looses lots of Exp.*
Twink: society challenge Notsobig   *Twink exploits that to become leader.*
Twink: society rank Notsobig -3   *He really is an a... .*
Twink: ' Bigone, 20 plat to me and you are back in.   *Etc.*

Leader Dumbone changes names of some ranks:

Dumbone: society name leader Archmage of    *Note: add a trailing space.*
Dumbone: society name normal   *No name means only association name is shown.*
Dumbone: society name god Stupid one of   *He can't do it anyway, but...*
God: tell Dumbone Nice try, goodbye.   *... a god caught him trying.*
God: society punish Dumbone    *Dumbone is made enemy and since he is in
God: society punish Dumbone     guildhall the guards kill him.*

<Note -gods can access all your mortal commands and outrank everybody!
Furthermore gods can BAN a mortal from all associations -this happens
to Dumbone now after the god had his fun having him killed.>

SORCERER (Sub-Class of: Magic-User)
===========================================================================
Sorcerers are spellcasters who have devoted their lives to the pursuit of
great and powerful magic. The spells at their command are primarily
offensive and are not granted through the worship of any deity. Sorcerers
are physically weak by most standards, and can be quite frail. Their
abilities at hand-to-hand combat leave much to be desired, and, in most
cases, they leave the fighting arts to Fighters. To make up for these
handicaps, Sorcerers have created some of the deadliest spells in the
world, many of which can kill with a single blow.

Allowable races:        Human, Grey Elf, Halfling, Gnome, Goblin,
                        Half-Elf, Orc, Githyanki, Drow Elf, Lich, Vampire,
                        Shade, Harpy, Gargoyle

Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.

Equipment usage: 	Sorcerers have their own classification of item 
                        restriction. This means they have the smallest range 
                        of weapons that they can wield and a very small 
                        range of armor to choose from. They have almost no 
                        restrictions on what miscellaneous magical items 
                        they can use.

SPELLBIND (Skill)
===========================================================================
Syntax: <spellbind item_name>
	<spellbind> Lets the alchemist see accumulated power

With this powerful enchantment skill the alchemist can empower an item
with mystical energies enhancing the properties of the item. The rate to 
which the item is improved is based on the level and skill of the 
alchemist. The first stat of the item will also be raised more than the 
second stat of the item.

When an item has been enchanted the magical energies make it impossible to
repair. Even a failed attempt will render the item unrepairable. There is 
also a chance that the item will be damaged in the process.

In order to gain the power necessary to spellbind items the alchemist needs 
to harvest power by killing creatures greater than 10 levels below his own 
level. The alternative is to gain this power by fragging. With each 0.1 
frags the alchemist can spellbind one item.

#
"SPELL CIRCLE" (General Information)
===========================================================================
Just as in AD&D, Duris has placed its spells in various levels called
circles. As a caster gains in level, he learns more of the magical arts and
has a larger repertoire of spells to choose fro . These new spells exist in
"Circles". At any given level, a caster can draw from a specified number of
circles and can memorize/pray/tupor/assimilate/commune for a certain number 
of spells in each circle which fit into "Spell Slots". As a caster's level 
increases he learns more magic and can draw from more circles as well as 
regenerate more spells from each circle. The circles are gained as follows:

        Level 1 -1st Circle
        Level 6 -2nd Circle
        Level 11 -3rd Circle
        Level 16 -4th Circle
        Level 21 -5th Circle
        Level 26 -6th Circle
        Level 31 -7th Circle
        Level 36 -8th Circle
        Level 41 -9th Circle
        Level 46 -10th Circle
        Level 51 -11th Circle
        Level 56 -12th Circle

See the specific help files on each class to find out which spells belong
to each circle for any given class. There is a slight chance of spell
failure for the last circle learned.

#
"SPELL FAILURE" (General Information)
===========================================================================
A caster who has practiced specific spells for a long period of time
becomes very skilled at casting the spells. He is able to work his magic
without fear of error or incorrectly invoking magic. So, as he gains in
levels, the lower spells become second nature to him. However, when he is
charged with learning new spells of a more complicated nature than he is
used to, he may find it difficult to cast without error. So, casters will
find that they sometimes cannot cast a spell of their highest circle every
time they try. Expect spell failure as you are learning the spells and are
not yet a master of their powers.

#
"SPELL SLOT" (General Information)
===========================================================================
A caster is able to hold a certain number of spells in each spell circle, 
dependent on level. Each spell occupies one spell slot in the given circle. 
Casters that commune, assimilate or tupor cannot choose what spells will
fill their specific slots, unlike casters that memorize and pray.

#
"SPELL SYSTEM" (General Information)
===========================================================================
Duris, in its attempt to improve on the standard, stock DikuMUDs that 
already exist throughout the Internet, has moved away from the traditional 
mana system. In its place, the Duris Forgers have implemented a system very 
similar to that used in the AD&D game. Rather than a pool of mana from 
which any spell can be drawn, casters on Duris must memorize/pray/commune/
assimilate or tupor spells. These spells are divided into different "Spell
Circles" limiting the spells that a caster/semi-caster can draw upon. At 
level 1, a caster is proficient in one spell circle and is allotted one 
"Spell Slot" from that circle which he can regain via one of the methods 
listed above. As he gains in levels, the numbers of slots available in each 
circle increases as does the number of circles in which the caster is 
proficient. The caster has available to him a number of spells at each 
circle which he can regenerate. He simply chooses those spells which he 
wishes to use then must fill his reservoir in one of the mentioned ways. 
The slots can be used up on all different spells or all on the same spell or 
any combination of spells. These spells are then a part of the caster's mind 
and can be called upon at any time. Once a spell is cast it  s no longer 
memorized or prayed for. It becomes a spell that needs to be memorized again. 
It cannot be cast again until it is re-memorized or re-prayed for.

SPRINGLEAP (Skill)
===========================================================================
Syntax:         springleap <victim> (while kneeling)
Aggressive:     Yes

Springleap is a bash-like skill with painful consequences. The springleaper 
crouches to his knees and suddenly jumps into his opponent. If successful, 
the opponent will be knocked off balance and fall to the ground for a couple 
of rounds, unable to defend himself. If the springleaper fails, however, he 
will be the one that is knocked to the ground and unable to defend himself!

A monk who has chosen the path of the Dragon Disciple has sharpened many of
his fighting skills, including springleap. The extra abilities include

#
STANCES
===========================================================================
Syntax: <stance none|offensive|defensive>

A player can make use of stances to increase his defensive and offensive 
capabilities when fighting. The offensive stance will raise all skills 
flagged offensive by a set number and all defensive skills will be lowered 
by the same number. The reverse is used when going into the defensive 
stance. Stances are later used when dealing with group formations and will 
then deal other bonuses depending on which formation was chosen. 

If someone other than the group leader, which is defined by the person 
everyone follows, uses a stance while the group is not in formation then 
that person will not be able to follow the group leader.

Something that should be noted when using stances is that it affects the 
skill dodge. A high skill in dodge will make the character harder to bash 
and this value goes up if you are in defensive stances and it goes down if 
you are in offensive stance.

#
STATS STATISTICS (General Information)
===========================================================================
Duris character abilities are on a bell-curved 1-100 scale. The number 
given to any statistic is a measure of how you rate WITHIN YOUR OWN RACE. A 
Gnome with 100 Strength, for example, is as strong as it is possible for a 
Gnome to be, without major magical enhancement. However, even a moderately 
strong Ogre would be vastly stronger than a 100 strength Gnome. Ogres are 
known for strength, Gnomes are not. The conversion factors for a given race 
are hidden and not available to players. Experimentation will no doubt 
discover some of them, and checking the help on a race will give you an 
idea where their strengths and weaknesses lie. All races of Duris use the 
same scale (1-100) and all races have their own set of conversion factors. 
Do not bother asking a God what these factors are, most won't know.
Furthermore, the ones that do know will not tell you, experiment and find 
out.

protects against varies with level and proficiency of the caster. If a

THAC0 (General Information)
===========================================================================
THAC0 is an acronym for "To Hit Armor Class 0". THAC0 is a number every 
player and monster has and it is dependent on level and class. It is ranged
between 0 and 20. THAC0 is the method that the MUD code uses to determine 
whether or not you have successfully "hit" an opponent while in battle. It 
is calculated for everyone fighting, for each and every combat round. For 
THAC0's, the lower the number you have, the better success you will have at 
hitting.

For example: Let's say your THAC0 is 10, meaning you have to roll between 
10 and 20 on a 20-sided die in order to hit an enemy with an armor class of 
0. If you are fighting a monster with an armor class of 1, then you need to 
roll between 11 and 20 to hit that mob. If the mob's armor class is 8, you 
only need to roll between 2 and 20 in order to hit that monster. You can 
affect your THAC0 by using magical items that give a positive hitroll bonus.  
This bonus will enhance your THAC0 and therefore your ability to hit a 
monster.

The help entry for AC (Armor Class) further explains how this hit/miss
system works.

THARNADIA
===========================================================================
The sprawling metropolis of Tharnadia is the most active city in all of
Duris. It is the cornerstone of the human economy and the jewel of their
empire. Tharnadia can be found in the southwest corner of the continent,
nestled against its broad and busy port.

Perhaps the most popular place to congregate in Tharnadia is the Ogre's 
Foot Inn. The inn is located roughly in the center of the city, directly in
front of the city's constantly-bubbling fountain. To the west of the Inn 
you will find the city's resident cleric-physician, who will tend to your 
wounds for a small fee. Further west are the stairs to the Shr'nn Mesa, 
which leads to the city's prison -Caer Tannad. Upon further exploration
you'll be happy to find many guild towers complete with shops and teachers,
and also the main cargo port for Tharnadia lies here. The northenmost part
of the city opens up to Tharnadia's port beaches, where one can take a
casual stroll to take in the salty ocean air. Be careful there, though, the
beach can be dangerous to those caught unaware. On the beach itself lies
Bradistock Manor, famous for the haunting tales that keep many Tharnadian
children awake at night. The southern part of the city is renowned for its
seedy back-alleys, thugs and criminals. Far enough south, however, and the
beach can once again be found leading to the lighthouse and Tranquility
island. Leaving the Inn to the east going towards the gates of the city,
you can't help but notice the sites and smells of the local Baazar.
Travelers from all around stop to sample the wares sold here. North of the 
Baazar is a Bank and the magnificent Temple of the Paladins, where all are
welcome to stop and rest up awhile. Before leaving the city make sure to
stop and rent a mount for the journey for a trip across Goodie Continent
can be a tiring one!

Traveling out of the city on the Grand Tharnadia Way you will pass through
it's beautiful forest filled with a variety of animal life, ponds and
walking trails.

THIEF (Specialization)
===========================================================================
Thieves are masters of stealth, deceit, concealment, and they'll relieve
you of your valuables if you don't watch your purse. The main cause of
thieves is to take what is yours and to make it their own, preferably
without their victims knowing about it. But if backed into a corner,
thieves can be deadly enemies and are more than capable of fighting their
way out of tight spots. The dreaded thief is also renowned for its ability
to pick locks, alter their identity, to vanish into the shadows, not to
mention hunting their prey to the ends of the world to get what they want.

Thieves are held fully to the rules listed in Help Raid for equipment
guidelines, and while engaged in pstealing or pkilling they are considered
"primary" characters and as such must wear the best equipment available up
to and including removing equipment from their other characters to meet
these guidelines. This DOES include artifacts, uniques, and iouns, *unless*
they are not usable by a thief.  

ALL items stolen by a thief must be worn by the thief *unless* they cannot
use the object or are currently wearing better in that slot, in which case
it may be stored or given away.

ALL slots must be filled on a thief when at all possible, this includes
removing pieces of equipment from other characters that may not make much
sense on a thief.

For example, if you have the max_int ioun on another character, you MUST
remove it and put it on your thief when playing it. The only exception is
if the thief is currently wearing another ioun.

Thieves CANNOT be shared by multiple players at once. If any thief is found
being shared, they will be terminated whether or not the owner is online. 
Trying to get by these rules will be met with harsh consequences. If you
are unsure about what is legal or not, ask a god.

THRI-KREEN (General Information)

and 2 legs for walking. The Thri-Kreen are about 7 feet tall and up to 11
feet long, however they do not weight much, and are there for considered
medium in size. 

Thri-Kreen are desert dwelling nomadic warriors that are neutral in most of
their dealings with other races. On Duris, this means that some of them will
be with the forces of good, some with evil.

Thri-Kreen having 4 arms 4 hands and thus, can wield up to 4 weapons at a
time including 2 2-handed weapons, or a bow and 2 weapons or any combo.
Thri-Kreen can also wear 4 sets of wrist-eq, 2 sets of hand wear, 2 sets of
sleeve eq. But they have no true fingers, and no ears. So they can not wear
any ear-rings or normal finger rings, and due to the odd nature of their
body and feet, they can not wear anything on their feet or body armor.

Thri-Kreen are a neutral born race, which means they can pick the path in
life in which they will walk, so, a Thri-Kreen must chose this path when he
is created.

Class list:       Warrior.
Statisticss:      Quite strong, tall and thin, very quick, also very high
                  in agility and very high dex. they are swift and fearsome
                  warriors.
Innate abilities: infravision, ultravision, leap, poison bite.

Thri-Kreen are extremely vulnerable to the cold and cold-based spells, the 
shock to their systems may in many cases even cause minor paralysis. Due to
their exoskeletal nature, thri-kreen are somewhat weaker than endoskeletal
races, and therefore will not receive certain stat bonus granted by various
spells and active skills.

TITLES (General Information)
===========================================================================
Duris is a fantasy based mud and as such we expect the players to have 
fantasy based titles, if they have them at all. What a proper title is
might be different for most but there are some basics. 

	-Do not use foul language
	-Do not use racial slurs
 	-Keep it in character

Duris may not be a role-play mud but that does not mean we don't work hard 
to try to cultivate a good fantasy feeling while online. Any title that 
breaks this is considered a bad title and may be subject to change. If guild 
ranks are out of line the guild is subject to be disbanded.

#
TOLM (General Information)
===========================================================================
"Tolm" is often referred to a player on Duris, who can often be found
repeating such phrases as "wuss", "enjoy", "rofl", and "at once". If in
close contact with Tolm, one should be aware he commonly passes large
amounts of gaseous flatulence, causing a tremendous stench to fill the room
and killing all those within it. Choosing to follow Tolm can result in 
instantaneous death, as he can often times be remembered as spamming 
through a high aggro area and leaving his comrades behind. In reality,
though, Tolm is simply a bot created by the gods of Duris for their 
amusement. Paying close attention, one might notice his responses to things 
are quite limited, as shown above. Great care should be taken when dealing
with Tolm.

#
TOTEMS (General Information)
===========================================================================
Totems are required by Shamans to cast their spells, as they allow them to
focus their energies into magic.

Shaman spells are divided into "spheres" -animal, elemental, and
spiritual. Lesser totems are used to cast spells in a certain sphere below
6th circle, while greater totems are used to cast those spells 6th and
over. Totems can also grant more than one sphere or high/low-level spells.
Totems must be held while casting (but not required during memorizing).

Newbie Shamans load with three totems (raven, limestone, ivory), each of
which grants the lower spells for a certain sphere. (raven =animal,
limestone =elemental, ivory =spiritual).

Higher totems can be bought at various Shaman-related stores around the
mud, as well as created by the "Minor Creation" spell.

TROLL "SWAMP TROLL"
===========================================================================
Swamp trolls are a huge, massive, evil, and disgusting species that are
greatly feared by all races. They are often hunted by humans, and are 
easily identifiable by their decided lack of intelligence, green hair, and 
pale-green, horned and slimy skin. Trolls' strength is horrifying and, 
since they are destructive by nature, they customarily spend all of their 
time killing and destroying. Trolls also frequently raid towns in order to 
procure slaves that become the "guests of honor" at future feasts. Trolls 
live in hot swamps and lakes, and generally band together in clans. Their 
only contact with other races occurs during acts of war. Trolls regenerate 
faster than other races do, and possess innate ultravision.

Class list:       Warrior, Shaman, Mercenary.
Statistics:       Quite strong, tall and thin, very quick, also regen hit
                  points at a truly amazing rate, however, they are almost
                  as stupid as ogres, just about as ugly too. Only what
                  passes as a genius for a troll will do well as a shaman.
Innate abilities: ultravision, bodyslam (warrior only), doorbash,
                  regeneration

&+RWarning:&n  As one of the eight evil races on Duris, trolls are
extremely difficult to play and face many hardships.  Their hometown
has been specifically designed to make life hell, and death waits
around every corner.  Trolls will most certainly encounter situations
that would be deemed "unfair" to any of the surface races.  We did
this to create a new challenge for those advances players who have
"beaten" the challenge of life on the surface world and are looking
for something more difficult.  You should NOT play a troll unless you
are a *very* advanced player and are used to the Duris style of
MUDding, or are willing to face the hardships without complaint, as it
is NOT easy.

&+RNOTE&n:  Trolls are extremely vulnerable to all fire-based spells
            and will take more damage from them.

TROPHY (General Information)
===========================================================================
Syntax:    trophy

The trophy list is a feature which lets you gain a general idea of the
amount of experience (relative to a particular mob) you are gaining  or the 
mobs you kill. The trophy ensures that you do not gain experience by 
"sitting on mobs" as the more you kill any particular mob, the less
experience you will gain for it. If you kill too many of any particular
mob, you will eventually gain no experience at all for it.

The trophy list will help your decisions by letting you know how many of
any particular mob you have already killed. If you are in a group, you
will only gain a portion of that kill added to your trophy. Therefore,
you will see percentages on your trophy list. Trophy entries will also
change colors as the amount of experience you get for a kill becomes
less and less.

VAMPIRE
==========================================================================
Among the most dreaded of the undead hordes is the Vampire. Vampires are
readily identifiable by the seasoned adventurer; pallid skin, long fangs
protruding from the top of their mouths, the odor of a juicy corpse, and a
perceptible aura of pure evil. Like most undead, Vampires are only active
at nighttime or in very dark places where most mortals fear to tread. 
Vampires are notorious for draining the lifeblood of their enemies to

WARLOCK (Sub-Class of: Priest)
===========================================================================
Warlocks are malevolent practitioners of dark, forbidden magics that
have only been mastered by the Undead.  Their powers are based neither
in the conventional magics practiced by mortals, nor in the power of the
mind like the illithids.  Warlocks tap into the dark realm of the 
negative material plane, but the greater part of their energy comes from
the bowels of hell itself.  The nature of their power not only vanquishes
their enemies, it also increases the Warlock's own power and energy.  Any 
simple mortal attempting to dabble in such horrid sorcery would almost 
surely be annihilated immediately.

Allowable races:        Vampire, Lich, Shade

Innate Abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.

Equipment usage:        Warlock fall under the Priest classification
                        of item restriction.  This means they are
                        restricted to use of non-edged weapons such as
                        maces, clubs and staves. They can wear almost 
                        any type of armor, but are mildly restricted 
                        in the use of miscellaneous magical items.

#
WARRIOR (Sub-Class of: Fighter)
===========================================================================
Warriors have more strength than the average player, and this makes them
better at hand-to-hand combat. They possess skills of fighting that are
unequaled by members of any other class. Because they employ such finesse
in their fighting tactics, Warriors have been thought to resemble
swashbucklers or fencers when at their best. They are, in essence, the
ultimate fighter and are the best in the world at skills such as bash, 
rescue, kick, and parry. The advantages of being a warrior lie within
these skills.

Allowable races:        Human, Barbarian, Drow Elf, Grey Elf, 
                        Mountain Dwarf, Duergar Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, 
                        Ogre, Swamp Troll, Orc, Half-Elf, Goblin, Vampire, 
                        Wight, Githyanki, Centaur, Storm Giant, Thri-Kreen,
                        Minotaur, Shade, Revenant, Death Knight,
                        Shadow Beast.
Innate Abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Warriors have their own 
                        item restrictions. They can use most heavy armor 
                        and weapons but are more limited in using magical 
                        items.

#
WILDMAGE 
===========================================================================
The chaos mage will draw power from beyond reality, from the realm of Chaos.
This realm has immense power reserves but it is very hard to control. This 
will manifest itself by letting the mage get random results (often more 
powerful) when he casts his spell. The drawback is that he can loose control 
over the strong magic and harm random people in the room, be it friend of foe.
