&+GNow running on a new server!

The new server is costing considerably more than the old one, if you are
interested in donating to help with our ongoing costs, please visit
&+Rhttp://www.durismud.com/donate&n. Thanks!

Duris began a new era on January 5th, 2008. We are hoping that this 
will be the most enjoyable wipe ever for some of you, and for the 
newcomers, we hope that a fresh start will help you decide to make Duris 
your permanent home!

Be sure to check &+Wnews&n and &+Whelp&n as soon as you log
in-there are plenty of changes that everyone will want to see!

For new and returning players, make sure you read &+Whelp rules&n, 
as some of the rules have changed and will be strictly enforced this wipe.

Our website is 
&+chttp://www.durismud.com
