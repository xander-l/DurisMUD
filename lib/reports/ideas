**Gribs: ranger spells need to be able to refresh themselves
**Maworg: should make a skill that makes you able to sing while blinded, like blind singing or whatever!
**Larem: get rid of instant casting mobs, there isn't a pc alive who can cast with no casting time, why should mobs beallowwed to
**Tindir: please make more ways for us seminew players without 1000 highlvl friends to reach level 51 at least, getting bored with donating frags to unkillable evils stuck at level 46:(
**Diz: multi-class chars aren't more powerful then prime classes with spec's. The 3x epics needed for levels after 50 is a bit much, maybe consider lowering it to 2x. Also, if a spec char wants to change specs it only cost them a epic skill point. Multi-Class chars whom want to re-multi to another class has to start back over at level 1. To change multi should also only cost 1 epic skill point.
**Diz: with the changes to Earth Quake, maybe Earthen Rain should also be improved...
**Krundor: let woodseer sell to humans again!
**Tindir: make the bartenderquests less expensive to abandon
**Tindir: make bartenderquests 1 epic over level 46
**Hru: after a certain amount of time a task should also wear off!
**Skirok: monk springleap i know springleap should not be !fail but it hits about 70 percent 
**Ged: guardians should pulse faster after a failed rescue. Hence the name, guardian, it's their job, and to have the same pulse time after a failed attempt as any war priest/swordsman/paladorks is kind of defeating the whole guardian image
**Vaij: dagger
**Garis: add hp_reg and move_reg to eq sort
**Zloin: Skewer should be a separate skill and bashers shouldn't be able to skewer immediately after the bash, it's way unbalanced.
**Helty: left out coldshield on equip sort
**Sigurd: make githyankis clericable, holyman or healer spec
**Kabo: There is no help for innate speedy. I hope its not a joke innate coded on my char by an imm :).
**Diz: Healing Aura...Skill for Healers. Anyone within the Healers group will be effected by Accelerated Healing, Endurance, 
**Diz: Healing Aura...Skill for Healers. Anyone within the Healers group will be effected by Accelerated Healing, Endurance,  Healer has to be Leader of the Group.
**Diz: Healing Aura...Skill for Healers. Anyone within the Healers group will be effected by Accelerated Healing, Endurance and Song of Healing rate of healing is also improved.
**Avenia: instead of the amount of frags being affected by the amount of ppl in group it should be affected by the amount of artis in the group!
**Folsin: e
**Saif: hitpoint differences btw classes and races may be too large.. suggest bringing lower end up, and upper end down a bit
**Saif: make biofeedback spell override stone skin
**Thingol: It would be much easier if you could open the door by typing just the direction, i.e. "open east" instead of "open gates" or "open gates e". With this system i have trouble spelling the name of obstacle (gate, gates, fence, door, debris, etc...). If its intentional, then i appologize.
**Kabo: (continued) bah, so many ideas, i wont spam you. If you are even closely interested in talking about it more, i'll be on Kabo, Thingol, Darko or Odi...
**Kabo: (continued) this ensures that you can't buy out quests endlesly. You must chose carefuly if its easier to do the quest or pay 10k plat, and risk that another quest you do is basically unsolvable and you'd end up paying 20k plat.... "Spill blood" quests should be exempt from this rule.
**Kabo: (continued) however, being able to buy out quests is a nice way around when you gain plenty epic points. You could counter that by raising the price for buying out quests each consecutive time someone actually buys it out. This particular counter would be reset if someone actually fullfils the quest. Since i never bought a quest i don't know the exact sum, but pattern could be something like 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 etc. This way someone would get the chance to pay 8500 plat for 4 skill points, and 5th would cost 10k, 6th 20k....
**Kabo: (continued) i don't think that would be unbalanced since there are still a lot of ways you can spend your epics, and you still have that corrective factor of money that is needed to actually use epic skills. Gaining 100 epics per player in 10 man zone group for a zone that is never done is enough reward, and you still get to solve quests every 200 epic points so gaining plenty of epic points in a zone wont be abused.
**Kabo: After conversation with you guys not long ago, i got an idea how to promote rarely done zones. If it isn't already implemented, epics for a zone should be directly related to the time someone has done the zone, thus making zones that weren't done this wipe (i bet there are a few) insanely worthy epic points wise...
**Ged: make ethereal form actually hard to bash, ethermancers suck pvp, even worse solo pvp, need a boost
**Gimrod: - bard song: somehow i feel the potency of bard song been downed since a couple boots back... and would like to inform echo is broken atm... have not gotten any echo effect at all
**Kalla: disable look contact on ships that are docked. look contact should only be available for ship combat
**Kalla: max small ballistae on for of destroyers and med ballistae on dreadnaughts fore while cargo ships cannot have any weapons on bow or stern
**Diz: Please have a look at Bards songs, skills and spells. Almost everything is duplicated, plus 1 Spell per new Circle is not fair 3rd Circle Mirror Image only, 5th Circle Concealment, which is a crap spell noone uses becauses its useless, 9th Circle Feeblemind, another useless spell that never works, 10th Circle Detect Invis, 11th Circle Rope Trick (I would be laughing if I didn't like or play bards. Rope Trick, does hide, Bards have hide, shouldn't be a 11th Circle Spell for them. Also its the only thing a Bard gets for 51. 10th Circle Detect Invis, Song of Revelation does Detect Invis, which is also a 10th Circle Song. 9th Cir
**Pokula: i liked the recent idea of the disharmonist being able to remove a silence, but i think it should be a minstrel who can remove silence, and a disharmonist who can cast a silence (too much noise to concentrate/cast).
**Lorza: make all these mobs flagged barbarians be large size so i can headbutt somethign :D
**Pokula: some bard songs and spells/skills are redundant. how about an overhaul much like the druids and shamans got of yesteryear
**Pokula: bard songs should take effect right as the song starts!
**Astra: Quick Song Skill for Bards. a Skill that works like Quick Chant...helps a Bard get a song off faster and perhaps faster Waves
**Pokula: bard songs tick rather slow - how bout a quick song skill similiar to quick chant
**Astra: Bard Spells. Alot of the Bard Spells are duplicates of their Songs or Skills. Rope Trick is our 11th Circle (51) Spell which does a hide. Bards can alrdy Hide. How about moving this spell to a lower circle and giving us a more useful Spell for 11th Circle like anti-magic ray. or even reflection.
**Astra: also, song of heal use to do a mass heal. So the Bard would actually heal all in room. Now it does a regen thats is hardly useful for anything. Since this is a downgraded version of the song how about making Song of Heal group only now?
**Pokula: i think a bard should be able to use certain quality instruments (not wooden) as shields. when a shield (and block) are better options than using my songs in battle, you know something is wrong
**Pokula: think about changing bard song of healing to group only - now that its no longer a mass heal, i see no reason why it should continue to heal the room
**Astra: Bards only have 16 Spell on their entire roster, thats including 12th (lvl 56) spells. How about afew new spells. Bigby and Fireball are their only useful Off. Spells. How about afew more Off. based spells such as Anti-Magic Ray for 11th Circle (51) or Pris Spray.
**Astra: Give Scoundrel's Track....
**Astra: Improved Springleap. Epic Skill for those whom Springleap, upon a successful spring the attacker will do a Double Strike (Blademaster Skill)
**Diz: (Bards need a Level 51 Song, and also a Better 51 Spell, Rope Trick is a joke) Bard 51 Song. Song of Silence. Song provides those within the Bards group invis. With empower song would provide sneak for those within the Bards group and in the same room as the Bard. For Minstrels those with Empower Song it also provides Suppress Sound.
**Boko: stunning visions not have same message as a spell being shrugged. imprisonment has a message about a char not believing in it, could be something similar message to make more unique and diff than power word stun
**Aycer: fix bug for guardians to work more.
**Aktosh: make silent spell work while being bearhugged
**Garis: have terse battle mode work for solbeeps, magic missiles, etc
**Pax: cudgel
**Avenia: why would u make a cele key rentable? rentable keys are so cheesy
**Boko: there is spirit armor, phantom armor, and other armor type spells that don't seem to give more ac... at one point it was made that armor/spirit armor/phantom armor couldn't stack though. make they all give equal ac, but when stacked, only give a small % increase
**Krundor: turn innate hatred off... toggle it or something
**Krundor: more UD sneak items
**Krundor: amore exp for damage less from the kill
**Krundor: acid immolate to shamans...
**Nostra: - Allow crafting of 'hammer' type weapon?
**Krundor: more than 1 geg unpara
**Saif: energy control should also lower the other saves somewhat, and definately should lower save_fear at least -4.  after all, fear is only in the mind..
**Saif: eq sort could also display the list of items in decending order by the amount of the affect.. so if you're looking for quick hitpoint gear, you can grab the max items off the top
**Ghou: when a giant worm eats someone it should show up when you look in room... like "a bloated giant purple worm" or something of the sort
**Garis: remove double headbutt--even when it hits 4 times, it does 50 damage, or 12.5hp each...
**Hestir: give cenobites shape change, can't start as druid, and skill is one of a druid's strong points
**Hestir: true seeing should give farsee
**Xeres: would like to suggest that necro/diabolis/reaper/necrolyte with pets can travel through portal.. a spell that belong only to necro group
**Tasslyn: keyword chaining for items, like limestone-totem = "a small limestone totem" where keywords can be chained together to differentiate items that have similar keywords, and prevent people from handing you something with a totem keyword maliciously to prevent you from casting.
**Avenia: with a shoulder harness in place of bp
**Avenia: minotaurs should be able to carry us little guys on their backs
**Avenia: arti: mask of faces. allows anyone to disguise as another player
**Gam: Phantom Armor, though specific to illusionists, needs to be a bit more buff for that class.
**Krundor: when you die take a place of trophy?
**Gribs: sword
**Hru: spells like bigbys crushing hand, quivering palm etc, should do less damage to big mobs/people and more damage to small people (they take smash damage etc)
**Gribs: grey elves should have nat ultra
**Garis: headbutt should do more than 10 pvp damage
**Nogel: mob city emotes when a mob enters same room as a spammy mob :P
**Saif: psionicist spell penetration epic skill.  seems logical that psi attacks can get through resistances
**Abue: make gate key pop on gate guards outside of epic part of zone.  stupid key doesn't
**Znar: Eq wipe is a good idea, should make all full artifacts single item only like necroplasm. So if you wear an artifact you can't use any other artifacts/uniq's. Though some may need to be buffed a little to compensate
**Nostra: Last Fire Magus idea is requested at circle 10 or 11
**Nostra: Fire Magus should get Fire Form spell
**Lactsyr: the lag after tranquility should be lowered by the smallest positive amount possible.
**Mariul: should add hit_regen and move_regen to the locker sort
**Thimon: make spill enemy blood task so you can buy it off. i'm freaking cursed with it and had it for months.  I'm about to get a second task.  Thats a lot of blown epics.
**Nazz: Allow a person to enchant spells that are granted by eq
**Nazz: Allow a person to encrust spells that are granted by eq
**Gimrod: who
**Gimrod: suggesting heroism song to also improve on group member's save_fear
**Nazz: Remove the speed cap on boats so like it used to be your ships gained speed with better crews
**Zaxxzzonix: if it was jexni that removed squids, you suck, and dont deserve a god here, you playing here for what 3 or 4 years if that, and think yo king shit, but yo not, your a power tripping fuck
**Boko: blackness is to soulshield as lightning is to stoneskin... every protection has some weakness
**Krad: Just thinking if its not too complicated, could you make a quest for crafters to make a unique item?  Not anything too powerful but if someone were to have 100 skill they could have a quest to make one unique item.  Kind of like dwarves that make one special weapon in their life time that would be their ultimate in craftsmanship.
**Avenia: major paralysis is the gayest thing ever. i mean seriously. how hard is it to kill someone who stays parad for 5 minutes
**Oggie: with all the safety precautions of making hometowns !raid, please add port room into guildhalls
**Skirok: there should be an epic skill for monks like enhanced martial arts or something, seems ap/pallies get devestating crit and warrior types get two weapons epic skill why not monks!
**Zaxxzzonix: what the fuck with squids, you make me solo xp a char, against impossible xp odds for 3 or 4 months, only to take the squid away, why??
**Nzz: re eq wipe: please alter or remove platemail of dragonlords. the dragonkin race change is too powerful when coupled with certain classes, or with second artifacts...this has been true for _years_. if we MUST keep the race change ability then add some significant downsides and make the wearer appear as a D on map. some other suggestions: have it not change race, instead have it grant some dragonish abilities, such as simpler versions of rake, sweep roar, imp spawning, etc etc...something which fits the name..
**Rothak: eq sort hold would only sort for those things that can _only_ be held. Most items can be held along with worn in other slots
**Astra: Rope trick is a joke for a 51 Spell for Bards...and Bards still need a 51 song
**Lactsyr: The message from the 'quest' command should say something like "The <bartender> from <bartender's zone> gave you the following quest:" instead of just "The <bartender> gave you the following quest:".
**Milenius: Im very glad to hear that u decided not to pwipe. Im all for eq and frag/shipfrag wipe!
**Boko: Due to a slumping economy, Dwarven Kimordril merchants have resorted to thievery! hehe.. jk, but would be fun to have dwarf and duergar thieves even if not 'realistic'
**Aktosh: make silent spell have a shot at working while silenced by merc
**Ehra: staff
**Milenius: I see absolutly no point in pwiping, except it will reduce pbase 
**Milenius: pwipe is a worse possible idea
**Rila: group stornogs spheres became 1/2 as potent when breath was changed to bypass it
**Aktosh: make buddha palm reduced by soulshield, it kills, 400+ hps
**Aktosh: have summon ghasts have a chance to do a second round wave
**Aktosh: make power word kill hit more often on mobs when theres a large power difference
**Slazispem: I ride my first ship, I have idea, should be level for ships, have monsters in water, being able to fight the monsters with boat weapons! being able to see how mean monster is by using contact list. maby more exp on ship bigger weapons.
**Grenn: sorc shop in Nax should sell a beltable spellbook
**Krundor: monk multiclass
**Krundor: bandage self while resting!
**Larem: since centaurs seem to be unable to bash a lot of the larger mobs around, how bout a charge innate that can be preformed in battle?
**Larem: i'm a 600 lbs centaur, why do i bounce off most stuff?
**Rezla: crystaline
**Lactsyr: Since major para is back in the game, clerics should get a remove paralysis spell.
**Azarus: suggestions: bring mace of the earth back to its former glory, haste invis group stone prot all etc etc but have it load on ettenmoch mob and upgrade to an artifact.
**Karnik: illusionist should get feign at 56!
**Zel: Add Epic spells which are unlockable by epic points. for eg. Mana shield of Psionicists, where damage inflicted is split between mana and hp
**Zel: Add Epic spells which are unlockable by epic points. for eg. Mana shield of Psionicists, where damage inflicted is split between shield and hp
**Rila: put spec mob names (the ones that wander maps) in help files what the
**Zaxxzzonix: can you upgrade the length that enrage works? 2 rounds is not that long
**Cidem: Could you possibly consider nerfing shaman heals or buffing clerics somehow?  I just got to 30s with my healer and they are not nearly as use full as a shaman.  Just dont make sense for a shaman to be considered better in a group then a cleric.
**Zel: Indicate spec teachers' names in the helpfiles.
**Matak: Perhaps because all the races are much more equal these days some concessions could be made for a future wipe for evils side. Dayblind, being that some races are underdark dwellers they should indeed have tiny maps when they are on the surface during daylight hours. These races which should be dayblind are Orogs, Drow and Duergar. Ogres, Orcs, Trolls and Goblins are more surface dwelling evil races and should have some daysight, none as good as Orc though. Sun damage should be limited to races who are in fact weak against the sun, in D&D sun weakness runs to Trolls and Vampires which should take sun damage on a tick timer. Th
**Lactsyr: Aid should rem curse -> drop items in inventory
**Lactcon: the donation well should be sortable like lockers..
**Avenia: fix banish it's such poo now
**Avenia: guard no working right always
**Zarkas: I saw and have seen on PVP section the one on www. There is Zloin(goodie 51) and Zloine(evil 46?) the suspect thing is that Zloin been solo fraged by Choron(evil) like 3-4 times in StormPort.
**Choron: would be nice if multiclasses could spec their multiclasses for a rather high cost
**Milenius: I would like to see eq wipe instead of player wipe
**Zloin: Regardless of where i was on the map or what zone i was in
**Zloin: Oddly, some squid ported me over and over again without entering the rift, and shortly after an orog showed up each time.
**Loul: the hit_regen items frmo tharn (glowing steel necklace and magenta ring) could have extra item names coded so you can actually carry them around and swap em out to regen.. instead of just "ring" and "necklace" which makes it hard at times
**Hru: sorry, remove the cooldown on dragon punch
**Hru: remove the lag on dragon punch
**Arix: (like the losing side of racewar loses epics)
**Arix: frags should take epics away as well as give them!
**Sigurd: plz fix so warp and wormhole works in the same way for squids, not able to warp/rift people under 51, they r just permrifting expers making new peopLe quit
**Krundor: in game last pvsp log
**Krundor: make merc skills like bearhug not 100%.  It lands ALL the time on me
**Krundor: lowbie mobs stop being aggro to obviously much higher level ppl
**Astra: Blind Singing, works like blind fighting...if blinded the Bard will not stop singing her song when blinded....
**Astra: Epic Silent Song, give the Bard the ability to sing in silent room. Its just a chance tho, so not all waves will work.
**Krundor: allow players to purchase titles for a "limited" time...obviously people that abused get banned from service :)
**Nogel: add a "initiative" code, where the guy who rolls the highest initiative does the first combat round.
**Choron: please make it so that plasm can be worn together with other artis, casters should also be able to be really strong
**Choron: epic skill idea: this idea removes any ill effects from the user, the higher the level the faster its removed. lets say we call it "trance" then you "trance 'blindness'" and enter a deep trance for a certain amount of time and finally blind is gone. can be done for any ill effects, wither, blood to stone, poison etc. balance - at skill 100 it should take 10 secs to remove any ill effect, for each notch below 100, 5 more seconds should be added.
**Zastits: pwipe
**Ghou: Perhaps scent of the bloodhound could be updated so you don't get confused by your own (or groups) stink. .. I mean just smelling something at random doens't do much if it's so hard to tell if it's you or something else
**Arix: necromancesr icestorm
**Arix: give necromancers soulshield
**Avenia: reduce group caps to 8 and 9
**Arix: a UD map
**Keltron: longsword
**Korush: tree spell needs a help file
**Choron: it would be awesome if shipfights were recorded same way as regular fights, so whenever there is a ship getting fragged it adds up on the  website
**Arix: dark compact!!!
**Krundor: does innate hatred actually work?
**Gribs: waraxe
**Lactsyr: you should be able to climb mountains with massive move loss like on ocean, after climb skill is up even.
**Lactsyr: you should be able to climb mountains with massive move loss like on ocean
**Arix: auction list sort hold/held; needs to be added, doesn't exist currenlty.
**Garis: when ships are sunk, they lose their crews
**Garis: maul needs to be tweaked downwards... looking through logs, it knocks down over 75% of the time, has no size restricts, works on water, has a chance to stun, on a 1.4k+ hp char, that does upwards of 200hp per round with no proc, 
**Arix: limit on quaffing potions...you are too full or something
**Arix: rename doom blade to Doomsickle
**Avenia: group plane shift for 56 cleric spell!
**Nzz: Please fix maul. it is WAY too good considering how uber zerker damage is. it should probably be the least effective takedown in the game. :)
**Valymir: necklace
**Avenia: blind should probably negate guard
**Lactsyr: mob ships that we can kill for ship-battle practice
**Jotr: hellhounds of demonic riders could also vamp on kick
**Lactsyr: toughness should affect hp regen like endurance affects moves
**Wade: a ketch with one large ball should move the same speed as a ketch w/o weapons carring the same amount of weight in x number of cargo
**Wade: cargo speed should have also been affected when changes were made that allowed weapons to bought w/o loss of speed
**Wade: ship colors should only be seen when sailing otherwise its too easy to walk along the coast and spot an enemy. players should have to run to their ship and chase down that frag
**Dzyi: eyepatch
**Lactsyr: auction info should list available classes/races for any item that's limited (i.e. Elf only should show, or !warrior).
**Pokula: colar
**Zaxxzzonix: can you add detect illusion, and detect holy to illithids aura site please.
**Aycer: Can you switch the Boots of the MadMan back to what they were. They should have never been changed. MadMan Eq is godly quest items. not some standard item of the zone. They guy who made the zone was someone well respected and shouldnt be disrespected by having something he put so much time into to have an item name changed.
**Avenia: changing the crackhead boots' name was really lame. change it back
**Frr: make shadow shield, also have neg shield damaging affects when mage is hit
**Daqsta: make a neutral mob where you can pay like 1k plat for 1 hour arti feed. might not enforce raiding but it will force people to mine/sail for cash.
**Astra: Bards have the listen skill yet they dont get the improved listen epic skill
**Zel: Make shady gateguards track people who aggro.
**Avenia: this mud needs a 'stroke' social
**Ged: harpys plz
**Ged: frost magus get frost/ice elementals instead of air....windtalker gets air or change theirs to wind, just a little flavor!
**Daqsta: make it so you can only have 1 main arti at a time
**Zel: unaggro the patrol leaders and members in tharnadia.  evils cant do some parts of zone because of this
**Ferral: dragons suck
**Keltron: make teleport as it used to be.. if u teleport at the surface map u could end upp anywere at the map, even at some other continent!., now u get like 5 rooms. away. totaly useless.!
**Wade: punish zloin for blatantly cheating on forums. transfering necro eq cring naked and feeding evils through frag by using his goodie necro. http://durismud.com/mud/pvp_event.php?id=34139 he has used instant messages several times giving information to wern as to the status of evils who list
**Lactsyr: For ship frags, you shou
