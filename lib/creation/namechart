Name Selection Chart:  
---------------------

This is a medieval based fantasy MUD. If you pick a name that is NOT suited
to a MUD of this theme, you will be asked to change it.  Common names such  
as Bob, Tomas, or Mike are not acceptable, nor are names of famous fictional
characters such as Conan, Drizzt, Elric, etc.  Names that are a combination
of nouns or are misspelled real words are subject to the same restrictions.
Wynter, Shadowace or Blackknyght are all illegal names.

Profane names will result in deletion.

Does the current name you chose meet these criteria? (Y or N)
