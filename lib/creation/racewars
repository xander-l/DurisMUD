Race wars and the Good/Evil race concept as portrayed on Duris:
---------------------------------------------------------------

    Each of the races on Duris has their own city in which they start, and
each of those cities is located in a realistic place in the world where one
would find them.  Drow elves and duergar dwarves live in the Underdark, whereas
Humans, Grey elves, and Dwarves live on the surface world or in mountains.
The good races are in general easier to play than the evil races, because the
the life of evil-aligned characters is filled with unanticipated dangers and
hardships.

    The evil races on Duris were designed for advanced players who are quite
good at mudding in general and know the Duris rendition of Faerun well.  They
were added to create a challenge for for those advanced players, something that
would be VERY difficult to manage, but very rewarding at the same time.  While
you will be hard pressed to find an aggressive monster in any of the good 
cities, the evil cities are filled with them.  Many other challenges and dangers
await those daring enough to attempt to play the life of an evil-raced being,
but PLEASE note that they are extremely difficult.  If you are not VERY good at
mudding, and very good at mudding on THIS mud, you wont get far as an evil race.
We definitely suggest playing a good race for your first character!
