Racewars and the Good vs. Evil Concept as Portrayed on Duris:
---------------------------------------------------------------

In the world of Duris, the battle is between good and evil races. Here you
may choose the side you wish to battle alongside with.

The good races of Duris are somewhat easier to play than the evil races, as
the life of evil aligned characters is filled with unanticipated dangers and
hardships.

If you are new to Duris, you may wish to select a good aligned race. If 
instead you are up for a challenge, you may select an evil aligned race.

Press Return and choose your race with care...
