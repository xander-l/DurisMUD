Alignment Selection
-------------------
You now have to face a tough choice.  You must decide if you want
to join the forces of evil and darkness or the defenders of good
and light. Or maybe you wish to stay neutral, trying to restore
the balance of the world? Of course each side knows its own as
you soon will discover. And as you get caught up in the eternal
war between good and evil, you may find the lures of the other
side irresistible. But for now listen to your heart - and choose!
